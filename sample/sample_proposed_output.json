        "summary": "Alberta\u2019s new education minister will return attention to the new social studies curriculum, with plans to meet with teachers, Indigenous leaders and francophone representatives soon, he says.",
        "content": "Alberta's new education minister will return\u00a0attention to the new social studies curriculum, with plans to meet soon with teachers, Indigenous leaders and francophone representatives, he says.\nMinister Demetrios Nicolaides has no timeline for releasing updated new versions of curriculum for the subject, which has been hotly debated for years.\n\"I just want to make sure that I'm hearing it firsthand, and I'm getting a good perspective,\" he said of consultations planned for September and October.\nNicolaides, who has a PhD in social and political sciences, said he'd like curriculum designers to develop a social studies curriculum for kindergarten to Grade 12 all at once, to \"look at the whole picture.\" However, he says it\u00a0would become mandatory in stages to make school adoption manageable.\nNicolaides said he's also looking to hear from interested parties on the yet-unfinished new fine arts curriculum and junior and senior high curricula in all subjects.\nAlberta's attempt to replace its K-12 curriculum in all subjects, in English and French, has been a protracted affair,\u00a0stick-handled by three provincial governments with clashing\u00a0philosophies.\nNew programs of studies for math and English language arts became mandatory in K-3 last school year, and will expand to Grades 4-6 this year.\nAlberta government releases final versions of new math, English and wellness curricula\nAlberta's draft K-6 curriculum to be delayed in 4 subjects, LaGrange announces\nNew curriculum coming to K-6 classrooms this fall \u2014 but not all of it, education minister says\nThe new curriculum for science, French immersion language arts and Francophone language arts, will also become mandatory in schools for K-3 students this fall.\nAlthough many teachers, academics and parents have found fault with revised versions of all subjects \u2014\u00a0including claims some of the material is age inappropriate and culturally exclusive \u2014\u00a0the public outrage about\u00a0social studies and fine arts was the most vehement.\nExclusive\nEducation experts slam leaked Alberta curriculum proposals\nExclusive\nFormer Alberta Education staffer warned that curriculum approach could tank international rankings\nIt prompted Nicolaides' predecessor to scale back the rollout\u00a0of\u00a0those two subjects, and send them back to the department for an overhaul.\nA year ago, former Minister Adriana LaGrange had hoped new versions of all subjects would be used in all elementary grades by fall 2024. That timeline is now unclear.\nAlthough the UCP government appointed groups of teachers, academics and Indigenous experts to review the drafts, they later said the consultation was superficial and their feedback was largely dismissed. Most school authorities refused to pilot test draft versions while they were optional.\nExclusive\nTeachers consulted on draft curriculum say feedback was ignored\n\"I'm a firm believer that when you have more views and diverse viewpoints at the table, you deliver stronger products,\" Nicolaides said when asked how any new feedback would be incorporated.\nAlberta Teachers' Association president Jason Schilling said it's \"refreshing\" to hear Nicolaides strike a\u00a0collaborative tone.\nSchilling said he'll know teachers were heard if the government proposes a more realistic implementation timeline and includes content that matches students' developmental stages. Teachers and students are struggling now with math lessons Grade 2 and 3 students had no prerequisite knowledge to understand, he said.\nMandate letter emphasizes career connections\nPremier Danielle Smith released Nicolaides' \nmandate letter\n on Tuesday, which says despite the province's emphasis on job creation, \"we are not doing enough to encourage Alberta students to pursue career paths with the most plentiful and lucrative employment opportunities.\"\nThe letter says Nicolaides should focus on exposing Alberta's 766,000 K-12 students to career options, by increasing off-campus learning opportunities, paid internships, and dual-credit programs, which allow students to earn post-secondary and high school credits simultaneously. About 1,800 students took dual credits in 2021-22.\nNicolaides is to fulfil an election promise to spend $20 million in four years promoting job options through career fairs, establishing an online counselling website, launching ad campaigns for high-demand jobs, and equip more tradespeople to teach K-12 students.\nAspiring tradespeople can face lack of support, employer reluctance on apprenticeship journey\nAlberta school boards lobby to reinstate funding program for children with disabilities and delays\nNicolaides and Advanced Education Minister Rajan Sawhney are tasked with recommending how to fast-track teacher certification for professionals and tradespeople.\nRight now, post-degree teacher training programs in Alberta take about two years. A \"\nBridge to Teacher\n\" program for tradespeople also takes about two years.\nNicolaides said the length of those programs\u00a0could deter people with expertise in specialized technical areas, such as robotics or artificial intelligence, from pursuing teaching credentials.\nAbout 20 tradespeople a year are participating in Bridge to Teacher, he said.\nATA president Schilling said proposing truncated teacher training \"makes it sound like teaching is a really easy job.\"\nHe\u00a0said teachers need extensive training in how students learn to differentiate lessons for the diverse groups of students in ever-growing classes.\nDeprofessionalizing teaching risks lowering quality of education, he said.\nNicolaides said there are no plans to change the standards certified teachers must demonstrate.\nSmith has also tasked Nicolaides with \"reviewing and strengthening program unit funding (PUF),\" which may be welcome news to families who have young children with disabilities.\nParents, school boards and education advocates have criticized the UCP's decision to pare back\u00a0PUF and limit\u00a0support to preschoolers. The changes prompted school boards to cancel dozens of prekindergarten classes designed to prepare children with moderate and severe developmental delays for kindergarten. Kindergarteners also qualify\u00a0for less classroom support.\nNicolaides wouldn't say what changes he's considering, or on what timeline. He'll hear from early childhood education providers and families about how the program could potentially be expanded or improved, he said.\nSchilling said he's disappointed the mandate letter made no mention of Alberta schools being underfunded compared to other provinces. He said schools need a far larger funding injection than was included in the provincial budget to aid students with complex needs and make class sizes more manageable.",

        "summary": "An AIDS conference faced significant obstacles in receiving visas for delegates in time, and a substantial number of delegates claimed asylum following the meetings.",
        "content": "Almost one-sixth of guests at a major AIDS conference in Montreal last year who received Canadian visas ended up claiming asylum, according to internal data obtained by The Canadian Press.\nThe documents also show that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) struggled to work with the International AIDS Society as both tried to avoid a mass refusal of visas.\nWhen the society's conference got underway in Montreal in July 2022, dozens of delegates from Africa had been denied visas or never received responses to their applications. Some accused Ottawa of racism on stage, saying international gatherings should not return to Canada.\nThe controversy followed similar incidents at other global summits hosted in Canada in recent years, for which some African delegates could not obtain visas despite receiving invitations on Canadian government letterhead.\nDocuments obtained through access-to-information laws show that 1,020 visa applications\u00a0for last summer's AIDS conference were rejected, representing 36 per cent. Another 10 per cent were not processed by the end of the event.\nCanada issued 1,638 visas for the conference, and the documents show that at least 251 people, or about 15 per cent, claimed asylum after entering the country.\nIRCC finds no fault in Montreal AIDS summit visa debacle\nVisa denials denounced at Montreal AIDS conference, federal minister cancels speech\nRobert Blanshay, a Toronto immigration lawyer, said making an asylum claim by attending a conference or sporting event in Canada is often one of the few ways people can get to safety.\n\"I'm not surprised at all that the percentage of people from a certain country [who were]\u00a0issued visitor visas to come would actually not return home and claim refugee status,\" he said, adding that the idea sometimes only occurs to people after they reach Canada and hear about others doing so.\n\"Good for them. If this is their only way of claiming asylum in a country, then so be it.\"\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has found no fault in its handling of visas related to last year's AIDS conference in Montreal.\n \n(Casey Stranges/CBC)\nBlanshay said Canada already makes it difficult to get a visa for legitimate purposes\u00a0and to claim asylum.\nVisa applications are often denied if an applicant doesn't prove they have enough reasons to stay in their country of residence, such as a stable job, financial savings and family ties.\nOttawa rejected 83.5 per cent of visa applications by prospective conference attendees from Nepal; 55.8 per cent of those from Nigeria; 53.6 per cent from Pakistan and more than 40 per cent from Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia and Ghana.\nMost problems came from conference itself: IRCC\nAn internal report last November that assessed the Immigration Department's handling of the conference suggested \"the need to have better co-ordination of high-profile events, ensuring that partners are engaged early on and that they remain in constant, continued and detailed communication.\"\nThe report said there were some shortfalls within the department, such as a system glitch that made it difficult for some applicants to include an event code used to organize event attendees in a database.\nBut it largely put the blame on the Geneva-based conference organizers. The International AIDS Society did not respond to questions before deadline.\nSix weeks ahead of the conference, the document said, organizers provided a list of 6,609 participants but did not include information that was important for identifying their visa applications, including birthdates and application numbers. About two weeks later, the department asked for a list of priority VIPs, and organizers provided 4,200 names. Eventually, the department got the number down to 150 priority attendees.\nCBC Explains\nAsylum seekers and refugees \u2014 what's the difference?\nUganda president signs anti-LGBTQ bill, which includes death penalty provisions, into law\n\"Organizers continually questioned refusals, asking for detailed case-specific information,\" the report said.\nPublic servants began following up on cases individually. Meanwhile, despite saying the cutoff for applications would be two weeks before the event's start date, they continued receiving new requests.\nIt said it is still monitoring the outcomes of the 251 people who claimed asylum after arriving in Canada for the conference last year.\nAmong them were 123 people from Uganda, which has some of the world's most repressive criminal laws against homosexuality. People living in Kenya made 58 claims, while 26 came from people originating from Nigeria.",

It was the first women's hockey team to represent Alberta at a national championship and was also the longest-running senior women's AAA hockey program in the province.\u00a0\nBetween 1983 and 1993, the Chimos won every provincial championship they could compete in and three Abby Hoffman Cup national women's championships.\n\"The body of work, when you look at it over that decade, is pretty remarkable,\" said Mel Davidson, a member of the induction committee for the Alberta Hockey Hall of Fame. \"They all just came together, and they were one of the most successful teams in our province, men or women.\"\nDavidson said that another achievement of the Edmonton Chimos is that they laid the groundwork for women's hockey in Alberta at a time when it barely existed.\nMiyauchi remembers experiencing some hostility from the Edmonton hockey community when she first began playing with the Chimos.\nHowever, she said a significant characteristic that defined the Chimos was their willingness to disregard anything or anyone that deterred the team from playing the sport.\n'Hostile stares'\n\"I was part of the group that remembers not being entirely accepted into arenas at the very beginning and having to go in through the back door or having to endure hostile stares as we walked in with our hockey bags,\" Miyauchi said.\nIt was even difficult for the Edmonton Chimos to find arenas to play at in Edmonton, Miyauchi added.\n\"We weren't entirely supported in the city in terms of being provided with ice time. So for many, many years, our home ice was in places like Duffield, New Sarepta, and Calmar.\"\nDavidson said that it was in these small towns and hamlets around Edmonton that the Chimos found popularity and support.\n\"They'd be able to go out into small towns, where really, at that time, women playing hockey was a huge novelty, and they'd pack those rinks,\" said Davidson\nMiyauchi said that she believes that the existence of the Edmonton Chimos, and their ability to overcome barriers and stigma to participate in the sport, acted as a \"catalyst for a lot of other women's hockey teams to start up.\"\n\"The thing that was the trademark characteristic of the team was to work hard, tirelessly, and just persevere and ignore anybody who thought we ought not to be doing what we were doing and just play,\" said Miyauchi.\n\"The fact that the Chimos were out there and doing it gave a lot of people the confidence, the desire, and the determination to do it because the Chimos had to overcome the odds and that made people believe they could too in their own communities.\"",

        "content": "Saskatoon's mayor and city councillors\u00a0still have a lot of work to do after wrapping up their\u00a0\nsecond special budget meeting\n on Tuesday.\u00a0\nCity council was able to shave $23 million off a $73\u00a0million budget shortfall over the next two years.\u00a0\nThat still leaves\u00a0shortfalls of about\u00a0$29 million\u00a0in 2024 and $20 million\u00a0in 2025 that council will attempt to address at a third special budget meeting planned for Aug. 15.\u00a0\nIf the remaining shortfall is not addressed residents, could see a property tax increase of 10\u00a0per cent in 2024 and a 6.2 per cent increase in 2025.\u00a0\nSaskatoon city council to consider potential cuts to address budget shortfall next week\nSaskatoon council fails to make inroads on city budget shortfall\nOn Tuesday, council voted to bump up parking fees by 50 cents an hour, which is expected to result in an extra $1 million in revenue.\u00a0\nIt also agreed on an additional\u00a015-cent convenience fee to use its\u00a0parking app.\nWard 1 Coun. Darren Hill was the sole vote against that decision.\u00a0\n\"It appears low-hanging fruit that the administrations picks simply to find a dollar\u00a0amount without enough engagement for the user group and studies and conversations\u00a0with the [Business Improvement Districts] for the impact\u00a0of [COVID-19] and the turnover in parking we're seeing and struggles that exist within those areas,\" he said.\u00a0\nThe North Saskatoon Business Association's\u00a0executive director, Keith Moen, said the city's finances have become a topic of conversation by those who \"normally don't give a hoot\" about civic politics.\u00a0\nHe urged council to listen to the recommendation put forward by the association, even though they've previously fallen on deaf ears.\u00a0\n\"In other words, you've stepped in it big time and everyone is watching,\" Moen said.\u00a0\nHe urged council to reduce staffing by ten per cent which would require cutting dozens of jobs and pausing\u00a0construction on\u00a0the downtown arena and new library.\u00a0\nCouncil did not approve the group's\u00a0recommendations, but\u00a0passed\u00a0a motion to\u00a0not\u00a0increase spending\u00a0on services\u00a0like\u00a0fire, snow removal and transit that grow with\u00a0inflation.\u00a0\nInstead, the money will be added back to the operating\u00a0budget in 2026.\u00a0\nSaskatoon's budget will be finalized at a meeting in November. Further special budget meetings could be scheduled before then.\u00a0\nUncertainty for small businesses and residents\nBrianna Solberg, the legislative affairs director for the\u00a0Canadian Federation of Independent Business, spoke with Candice Lipski on CBC Radio's \nSaskatoon Morning\n, discussing the concerns small businesses have with the budget shortfall and property taxes.\n\"Property taxes are particularly harmful to small business because they are profit insensitive,\" said Solberg, \"meaning business owners have to pay them even if they aren't bringing in any revenue and 53 per cent of Saskatchewan small businesses indicate that property taxes are the most harmful.\"\nSaskatoon Morning\n11:34\nSmall business, tax federation weigh in on what city can do to limit tax increases\nCandice Lipski talks with representatives of The Canadian Federation of Independent Business and Canadian Taxpayers Federation to get their thoughts on how to tackle the city's budget shortfall.\nHigher property tax rates could cause businesses to lay off staff or raise\u00a0prices\u00a0\u2014 or,\u00a0worst of all, Solberg said\u00a0businesses could close their doors for good.\nSolberg said she thinks the city needs to prioritize essential services, such as the police service and road repairs.\nGage Haubrich, prairie director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, also spoke with CBC Radio's \nSaskatoon Morning\n, and said residents were probably a little shocked to learn how dire the city's funding gap is.\n\"If you look at it compared to Regina, the City of Saskatoon spends about $400 more per person than Regina does,\" Haubrich said.\n\"Some of that comes from our own utility, but some people don't know where that extra money is going and it kind of caught them blindsided when they found out they might have to pay this extra property tax hike.\"\nHaubrich said\u00a0a property tax increase near seven per cent would be more reasonable because it would roughly match the rate of inflation in 2022.\u00a0\n\"That would still put a crunch on families, but it would be much better than what they are currently facing right now.\"",

        "content": "Consistent enforcement by police and city officials has marked a recovery in the local towing industry that, months ago, was struggling with violence and intimidation.\nHowever while\u00a0improvements have been noted, the towing industry could be facing new problems. Since June 9, four tow truck operators in the city have been suspended and charged for driving at excessive speeds.\n\"Both disturbing and unsafe is the way I would describe the actions of these tow truck drivers,\" said Orest Katolyk, the city's director of municipal compliance. \"The way we reduce it is, we take a very strong, proactive and progressive enforcement approach.\"\nThat strong, proactive approach started with an enforcement blitz that racked\u00a0up\u00a092 penalties and 10 warnings against 12 towing firms in just one week, following two back-to-back incidents that shocked Londoners and marked an upswing in violent and potentially deadly behaviour among tow truck drivers.\nLondon tow truck operators are working in fear, and don't think the city is doing enough\nIn November 2022, two\u00a0tow trucks were\u00a0torched in a secure lot, in what the victim alleged was an attack stemming from a dispute at an accident site. One day later, in\u00a0an unrelated incident, a driver from one tow company\u00a0was shot at on Adelaide Street\u00a0by two men in another tow company's vehicle.\nEnforcement helps\nOne local tow truck operator says things have improved since those days thanks to municipal action.\n\"It's good. I'm all for it. If you drive illegally, erratically, you should get in trouble. The stunt driving has definitely gone down,\" said Dwayne Cameron, of Sturdy's & Clarke's towing, who says he also still hears of instances of operators being dishonest and using confusion and intimidation to secure jobs, especially at collision sites.\nOperators still also get into altercations over customers, but not as often as in the past, Cameron said.\nDwayne Cameron, right, and his son Zachary Cameron at the company's south London yard.\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\nSome operators also engage in a practice called chasing, or scanning first responder radio frequencies, and then rushing to be the first to a scene. Both Katolyk and Cameron say this is the source of tow truck operators driving at excessive speeds.\nOverall\u00a0the city's strict\u00a0enforcement\u00a0has led to a safer environment for those within and outside the industry, despite not solving the problems entirely, according to Cameron.\nProvincial regulation a double-edged sword\nAmid violence and strife in the towing industries of other cities like Toronto, the provincial government has decided to step in to standardize certification for tow truck companies across the province.\nThe Ministry of Transportation says the move is to make the towing industry safer for its workers and the public.\nGTA tow-truck industry violence: Charges against 6 withdrawn as prosecution case partially collapses\nRegistration for the new system opened on July 4. It requires all\u00a0tow operators, tow truck drivers, and vehicle storage operators\u00a0to register for a provincial certificate\u00a0by January 1, 2024 for tow and vehicle storage operators, and July 2024 for tow truck drivers.\nAs of July 19, the Ministry of Transportation had received 636 provincial certification applications provincewide, and was unable to share how many of those applications were from London.\nThe new provincial certification system will do more to make the industry safe than the city's municipal licensing system, according to Cameron, but that additional\u00a0safety will come with a hitch.\nPart of the new regulation puts five year, 10 year, and\u00a0permanent certification bans based on an applicant's criminal record and the offence they've been convicted of.\n\"On one hand it's good. It's going to clean [the industry] up,\" said Cameron. \"But unfortunately some guys aren't the cleanest types. Some people had it\u00a0bad a couple years ago and still it affects them five to 10\u00a0years from now.\"\nThat could mean, despite the industry being safer from violence and reckless behaviour, some tow company owners could soon find themselves short staffed.\n\"Getting guys to actually drive tow trucks now will leave some of these companies hurt,\" Cameron said.\nProvincial rules slated for the tow industry include requirements for insurance, criminal record checks and rate caps for charging customers.\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\nTraining may also be a difficult issue to contend with, according to Cameron.\nPart of the new regulations is mandatory training courses, which is something Cameron\u00a0says he just paid $600 to receive from an internationally respected training and certification program called Wreckmaster.\n\"We don't even know if Wreckmaster is going to end up on the list of approved guys for training,\" said Cameron. \"They haven't even released that list and they're already taking applications.\"\nIt's too early to say though, what kind of effect provincial regulations will have on London's tow industry, though, and that's something both Katolyk and Cameron agree on.\n\"It's unfortunate that there's there's only a few bad apples that have\u00a0caused a\u00a0negative outlook on the on the entire towing industry. There are very good tow firms in London, and they are providing a valued service,\" Katolyk said.",

        "content": "Low water on the Mackenzie River is forcing major changes to how the annual resupply of fuel and cargo reaches some northern communities this summer.\nInstead of barging fuel and cargo down the Mackenzie River, the N.W.T.'s Marine Transportation Services will ship cargo overland and up the Dempster Highway, before delivery to communities by barge \u2014\u00a0a\u00a04,000-kilometre detour.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, fuel destined for northern communities will take an even longer route around Alaska.\u00a0\nIt's all because of low water levels at the ramparts, near Fort Good Hope, N.W.T., where the river narrows from nearly two kilometres wide to just over 100 metres.\u00a0\n\"This really is historically low water,\" said Tracy St-Denis,\u00a0assistant deputy minister for programs and services with the N.W.T.'s department of Infrastructure. \"It's been a very hot, dry summer.\"\nCargo destined for Inuvik will arrive by truck. Cargo heading to Aklavik, Tuktoyaktuk, Paulatuk, Sachs Harbour, Ulukhaktok, Kugluktuk and Fort Good Hope will move on from there by barge.\u00a0\nAs it did in 2022, fuel destined for Inuvik,\u00a0Ulukhaktok, Sachs Harbour and Paulatuk will be delivered via a tanker travelling the 5,000\u00a0kilometre shipping route\u00a0from Cherry Point, Wash., via the B.C. coast and around Alaska to Tuktoyaktuk. Fuel from the same tanker may also be barged up the Mackenzie River to Fort Good Hope.\u00a0\nSmall amounts of gasoline may also travel up the Dempster by road for barging to Ulukhaktok, Sachs Harbour and Paulatuk.\u00a0\nSt. Denis said her department had already arranged to bring fuel in \"over the top\" in order to ensure prompt delivery.\u00a0\n\"What we're trying to do is just make sure that we mitigate risks and we ensure that the \u2026 essential cargo and the fuel gets to the communities this summer,\" St. Denis said.\u00a0\nThe Mackenzie River from Hay River to Inuvik covers\u00a0roughly 1,600 kilometres. Both alternate routes will add hundreds of kilometres in distance that must be traveled.\u00a0 \nNo extra charge for customers\nSt. Denis said she hoped customers wouldn't notice the drastic changes underway.\u00a0\n\"From a customer's perspective, we're hoping that it's seamless and in fact there actually is no difference.\"\nInfrastructure department spokesperson\u00a0Darren Campbell\u00a0said no extra costs\u00a0associated with the unusual cargo season will\u00a0be passed on to customers.\u00a0\nIn a news release, Infrastructure Minister Diane Archie said it was a priority of the Marine Transportation Service to \"do all it can so residents and businesses that rely on its services for essential freight and fuel get these supplies in a cost-effective manner and without delay.\"\nThe route change\u00a0means people shipping cargo will have to get materials to Hay River earlier than they might have planned. The final acceptance date for Inuvik, Aklavik and Tuktoyaktuk has\u00a0been moved from July 30 to July 21. Other dates will be posted online when finalized.\u00a0\nCargo will travel as usual to Tulita, Norman Wells and \u0141\u00fatselk'e. Find the latest \ncargo acceptance dates here\n.\u00a0",

        "summary": "The federal government is considering a funding request for the proposed $700 million Melford terminal near Mulgrave, N.S.",
        "content": "The Canadian government says it may be willing to put some money into a proposed container terminal in Nova Scotia's\u00a0Strait of Canso, creating a second shipping port in the province in addition to the one located in Halifax.\nThat's welcome news to officials in Cape Breton Regional Municipality, which is also hoping to attract a container terminal for Sydney harbour, but it doesn't sit well with the Port of Halifax and its labour union.\nProponents are looking to build a terminal in Melford, near Mulgrave in Guysborough County, at an estimated cost of more than $700 million. They received federal and provincial approvals 15 years ago, but the project has never been built.\nNow, the federal transport minister's office says it is considering a funding request from the Melford terminal operators.\nPort developers in Melford and CBRM say they are closer to the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal than Halifax, providing an advantage in access to European and Asian markets, and both say they have plenty of land available for logistics and transfer facilities.\nThey also say the Halifax terminals are restricted by their urban surroundings.\nHalifax port concerned\nThe Port of Halifax \nhad a busy year last year\n, following a visit the previous year from the largest container ship to ever reach the east coast of North America.\nThe port is also making improvements that would move more cargo by rail and \nget heavy trucks out of the downtown area\n.\nIn an email, the Port of Halifax said it has the capacity to double its traffic from last year and it is \"concerning\" to hear of potential funding for a competitor that is not governed by a port authority.\nThe Port of Halifax, pictured above, said a new terminal would cost in excess of $1.5 billion 'and there is currently no demand for it.'\n \n(Port of Halifax)\nCanadian port authorities operate independently from government, but are guided by a board of directors that includes representatives from industry and all levels of government.\nIn addition, the Port of Halifax said its data suggest a new terminal would cost in excess of $1.5 billion \"and there is currently no demand for it.\"\nThe Halifax Longshoremen's Association, which represents workers at the port, said in a statement the federal government is jeopardizing its members.\n\"The port [of Halifax] is Nova Scotia's largest private sector employer, generating over 12,400 high-paying direct and indirect jobs and $1.7 billion in annual economic activity,\" the union said.\n\"The notion the federal government would fund a new competitor for the Port of Halifax is ludicrous.\"\nThe Melford container terminal is proposed for land in Guysborough County near Mulgrave, N.S.\n \n(Erin Pottie/CBC)\nIf the Melford terminal is built, 24 kilometres of rail line will need to be constructed another 10 kilometres of\u00a0existing rail bed refurbished in order to\u00a0connect the ice-free port to a CN line leading to the rest of the country and the United States.\nThe terminal project received \nenvironmental approvals\n in 2008 and its provincial permit to build has been extended numerous times.\nThe federal government has confirmed that Melford proponents recently asked for funding under the National Trade Corridors Fund, but it won't say how much was requested and would only say it is under consideration.\nSeveral media outlets have reported that Melford is asking for $175 million, but no one would confirm that number.\nMelford vice-president Richie Mann declined an interview request, saying the funding pitch is still before the government. However, he did say the proponents are optimistic that construction of a new terminal will start within a year.\nCBRM has been working to land a container terminal in Sydney harbour for several years and is hoping it will be located on land created with materials left over from the dredging of the harbour back in 2012.\nSydney proponents\n say there is also plenty of property nearby for logistics.\nA breakwater marks the edge of CBRM's land in Sydney harbour where proponents hope to put an offshore wind marshalling yard and a container terminal.\n \n(Tom Ayers/CBC)\nCBRM's promoters say it has room for a facility nearly three times the size of Halifax's and in the meantime, they are \npursuing an offshore wind turbine marshalling project\n that would take up a portion of the waterfront and 80 hectares of land.\nThey're also touting the harbour's\u00a0connection to the rest of North America by rail. But the rail line across Cape Breton Island covers more than 100 kilometres and hasn't seen a train since 2015, when the railway owner applied to discontinue and abandon it.\nThe province has been \npaying the company a subsidy\n to keep the line in place, amounting to more than $4 million so far, but it hasn't been maintained and a study pegged the cost of refurbishing the line so it could carry containers at more than $100 million.\nCBRM 'on upswing of development'\nCBRM Mayor Amanda McDougall said despite all that, the possibility of federal investment in a container terminal outside of Halifax is \"fantastic\" news.\n\"This is an indication that our region is on the upswing of development, specifically around ports, and it can only mean good for the whole seaboard,\" she said.\u00a0\"No one port ... is going to be able to handle it all themselves.\"\nCape Breton-Canso Liberal MP Mike Kelloway, who represents much of rural Cape Breton Island and the Guysborough area, said he supports Melford's request for federal funding.\nHe said government help for transportation infrastructure is important in order to improve supply chains and increase Canada's world competitiveness.\nBut funding decisions are based on the best business case and it doesn't mean government is picking winners and losers, Kelloway said.\n\"Time and time again we see ... the benefits of cluster businesses working hand in glove and sometimes it's competition, but I believe that competition brings out the best in people and the best in business.\"\nHe also said there's room for more than one terminal in Nova Scotia.\n\"I'm bullish on the fact that we can be a port province, that there's enough opportunity out there to warrant that.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\nEmpty truck found in flooded field as search continues for 4 missing people in Nova Scotia\nSouth Shore communities assess damage after historic rainfall\nNova Scotians describe harrowing encounters, damage from historic floods\n'A tough couple months': Flood forces 750 Halifax residents from their homes\nHow to prepare a go bag, emergency kit or evacuation plan",

        "content": "Cyclists are speaking out after some were\u00a0hit with hundreds of dollars in fines for riding through a busy Toronto intersection on pedestrian signals, saying being allowed to cross with those walking is a matter of road safety.\u00a0\nThis week, Toronto police were at the Yonge and Dundas intersection\u00a0issuing tickets\u00a0\u2014 as high as $325, according to Dave Shellnutt, a lawyer for cyclists\u00a0\u2014\u00a0to cyclists who proceeded through the intersection on the walk signal. In Ontario, the law requires cyclists to wait\u00a0for the conventional traffic lights, but at least\n one province changed that rule in 2019\n after a spate of cyclists deaths in motor vehicle collisions.\nVideo captures cyclist struck, dragged into intersection in north Toronto\nNow, following in line with\u00a0\nQuebec\n, some cyclists are calling for a similar change in Ontario after 36 collisions involving\u00a0cyclists last year in Toronto, with the majority resulting in major injuries and three\u00a0in deaths.\u00a0\nDespite knowing this province's rules, Toronto cycling advocate Alison Stewart says she regularly crosses early with the pedestrian signals.\n\"It's much safer. It keeps me in front of car traffic, and gives me the chance to be seen as I cross,\" said Stewart,\u00a0director of advocacy and public policy for Cycle Toronto.\nAdvocates want cyclists to cross first\n\"When I do so, I am always very cognizant of looking around to see if there are police on hand, just to make sure that I am not at risk of being targeted,\" she said.\nCycle Toronto is not advocating for cyclists to break existing laws, she says, but would like to see police use their resources differently and not target people for trying to protect themselves.\u00a0\nThe organization wants to see improvements to the province's Highway Traffic Act that to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, she says.\nStewart says the city has made great strides to improve safety for cycling and should continue to add special signals for cyclists and take other steps to allow cyclists to cross first until a wider sweeping change comes from the province.\u00a0\nLawyer wants a universal change\nBut Dave\u00a0Shellnutt, managing partner at the Biking Lawyer LLP, says piecemeal solutions from the city aren't the answer.\n\"All these variations are confusing and costly,\" he said.\u00a0\nDavid Shellnutt, a lawyer and cycling advocate based in Toronto, says cyclists are vulnerable road users and should be treated that way when it comes to crossing intersections.\n \n(Robin Pueyo)\nHe says many of the cases he sees as a lawyer for cyclists involve collisions at intersections. Early visibility by allowing cyclists to cross with pedestrians\u00a0is the clear solution, he says.\n\"Giving vulnerable road users an advantage at those intersections to sort of ward off sometimes imminent harm is an important thing,\" he said.\nHe says police should refrain from what he viewed as \"a blitz\" against cyclists and believes the public should be informed cyclists crossing with pedestrians is appropriate.\nPolice say 'not a blitz'\nToronto police deny the characterization of their actions by Shellnut and other cyclists as a \"blitz.\"\n\"52 Community Response was not on a \"blitz\", but were responding to calls from the public and local businesses,\" said Toronto Police spokesperson Victor Kwong.\nHe says police were receiving complaints about cyclists, including those on delivery, riding through the crowds of pedestrians who use the Yonge and Dundas scramble intersection, in which pedestrians can cross in all directions.\u00a0\nHe says officers spent months educating and warning cyclists instead of ticketing.\u00a0\nToronto Police did not confirm the number of tickets issued or the amount on those tickets.\nProvince won't say if it'll consider changes\nChanges to Ontario's Highway Traffic Act are up to the province.\nThe province's Ministry of Transportation wouldn't say if it would consider following Quebec's lead by making a similar change to the act.\nHowever, a ministry spokesperson,\u00a0Tanya Blazina, told CBC News in a statement,\u00a0\"As part of MTO's commitment to improve road safety and compliance, we regularly review our policies and practices to see if they are in keeping with current research findings and best practices worldwide.\"\nScott Butler, the executive director of Good Roads, a municipal association that advocates for safe roads in Ontario,\u00a0says studies from other jurisdictions including Australia indicate letting cyclists enter the intersections before cars is the right idea.\nThe advocacy group Good Roads says studies in other jurisdictions indicate letting cyclists enter intersections before cars is better for safety.\n \n(Michael Wilson/CBC)\n\"This sort of accommodation does allow for safer outcomes than the traditional approach we've had in place defined in the Highway Traffic Act,\" he said.\u00a0\nHe says pedestrians have to be given the most accommodation because they are the most vulnerable road users, but as long as cyclists yield to them, the model should work well.\nButler says he's hopeful the province will\u00a0follow Quebec's lead, saying the Ontario government\u00a0has already demonstrated an interest in improving road safety by \npassing legislation \naimed\u00a0at tackling\u00a0issues like stunt driving and better tracking cyclists being hit by car doors opening.\nMeanwhile, as\u00a0a lawyer seeing too many cases linked to dangerous roads for cyclists, Shellnutt says he wants to see change now.\n\u00a0\"Putting us out of work? Well, you know, anything, anything we can do for that\u00a0would be great.\"",

The company saw its e-commerce traffic increase by 48 per cent\u00a0when the collection was released in late June, and its Barbie platform shoe sold\u00a0out within 24 hours.\u00a0(Some other products sold out within 72 hours.)\n\"We tried to time the collection for this launch to coincide with the kind of peak-marketing hype of the movie,\" Neill said.\nNostalgia, annoyance\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it's complicated\nThe first \nBarbie \ntrailer was released in May, along with character posters that quickly turned into an online\u00a0trend when Warner Bros. released a meme-generator for fans to use.\nThe campaign to market the movie has only gotten louder \u2014 and pinker \u2014 since.\u00a0Though, it seems, not everyone is enjoying it.\u00a0\nI expect to enjoy the movie; but the marketing is like a tsunami\n&mdash;\n@j_smithcameron\nFor many, the doll's renewed relevance\u00a0conjures feelings of nostalgia \u2014 one of the elements that Canadian fashion designer Hilary MacMillan tried to capture in her own Barbie-inspired clothing line. Her\u00a015-piece capsule collection features a mix of styles for women and children\u00a0\u2014 and is pink as far as the eye can see.\n\"We actually didn't know the film was coming out when we first were in talks about the collection, because it was back in 2021,\" MacMillan told CBC News from her Toronto studio.\nWhen \nBarbie\n was announced, she said, \"We were like:\u00a0Here, it's coming, Barbiecore \u2014 we're going to be here.\"\n\"It's going to be an explosion of all things pink, all things Barbie. And so we felt like it was the perfect time. It all lined up perfectly for us.\"\nToronto fashion designer Hilary MacMillan has also released a Barbie-inspired clothing line, coinciding with the film's release.\n \n(CBC)\nThe Barbie doll has had a complex history since it was launched in 1959. While it was invented to be a career-oriented doll for young girls, its prototype \u2014 blond, white, impossibly thin \u2014 has since been frequently upheld as a symbol of unattainable beauty standards.\nA new line of Barbie dolls introduced in 2016 was aimed at bringing\u00a0the brand into the 21st century, with more racial and body diversity. Some of the dolls used wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs; a \nlater collection\n introduced Barbies\u00a0who were bald or who had vitiligo, a skin pigmentation condition.\nGroup Chat\nHow did we end up in a Barbie world?\nLong Read\nThink pink, think Barbie? How the doll changed the way we think about colour\n\"They've really dedicated a lot of effort and time into creating dolls of more sizes and of races and of different occupations, and kind of really being a brand that's trying to show that girls and women can do whatever they want,\" said MacMillan.\n\"I think the direction that they're heading in is kind of what speaks to our brand, because we are so cognitive and aware of diversity and size inclusion and offering more things to women.\"\nProducts that make you scratch your head\nSameer Hosany, a professor of marketing at the Royal Holloway University of London who has written about \nthe brand's long-term popularity\n, predicts there will be winners and losers from the Barbie marketing campaign, depending on how much a product\u00a0aligns with the brand.\nEven beyond the movie, he said, \"a lot of the corporations are tapping [into] the renaissance of Barbie itself \u2014 and that's why you would see [a] collaboration wave from designer brands to accessories, high fashion, shoes.\"\nWATCH |\u00a0Ryan Gosling surprises a CBC reporter on the red carpet:\n \n#TheMoment Ryan Gosling surprised a reporter on live TV\n23 days ago\nDuration \n1:33\nRyan Gosling decided to crash CBC reporter Eli Glasner\u2019s live TV hit on the Barbie pink carpet in Toronto.\n\"It's just because of that immediate fit of Barbie cutting across a number of product categories and brands,\" said Hosany, which is what makes a potential collaboration successful.\u00a0\nThe Lego Movie\n, for example, wouldn't warrant the same level of brand collaboration, he said.\nA handful of Barbie-inspired products might make you scratch your head. There is a Barbie Xbox, a Barbie rug, Barbie candles, glassware and electric toothbrushes. Progressive Insurance released a Barbie-inspired commercial starring Flo, the fictional salesperson who regularly appears in its ads.\u00a0\nAt Burger King locations in Brazil, customers can order a \"\nBarbie burger\n,\" which is a beef patty paired with cheese, bacon bits and slathered in a bright pink sauce that the fast-food chain described as \"smoky.\"\nBurger King Brazil unveils limited edition Pink Burger and Barbie Shake to celebrate the release of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Barbie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Barbie</a>.<br><br>Out tomorrow, July 12. <a href=\"https://t.co/EM98BroZvz\">pic.twitter.com/EM98BroZvz</a>\n&mdash;\n@PopCrave\nCross-promotion can be a high-risk strategy, said Hosany, as each brand's reputation depends on the other's. There's also the risk of \"brand dilution,\" in which a brand's reputation or value suffers because it releases a product at odds with its usual standards.\n\"A lot of this collaboration has been sort of very carefully selected,\" said Hosany.\nDespite\u00a0a number of other companies\u00a0jumping on the Barbiecore trend, putting their brightest pink products on display, MacMillan\u00a0said she isn't concerned about the ubiquity of the Barbie marketing campaign when it comes to her brand.\n\"I think our collection offers [something] a little bit different. It's not just like Barbie logos slashed across bucket hats or sweaters,\" she said.\n\"It's a little bit more elevated, Barbie-inspired, you know \u2014 nods of it. We have a specific kind of client for that. And so the more than merrier is kind of my mantra on it.\"",

We know that rankings don't always matter and we've just witnessed a huge upset in Group A with the Philippines (ranked No. 46) beating No. 26 New Zealand. World Cups are certainly a place for unpredictability and for new teams to forge their reputations.\u00a0\nBut Ireland is a different type of beast. They aren't new to elite competition and boast some of the top players in Europe, including Katie McCabe. McCabe is a key player at North London's Arsenal FC in the Women's Super League. In preparing for the match, Canadian coach Bev Priestman said that McCabe is one of the players that was deeply analyzed because of her strength and skill on the pitch.\u00a0\nKnowing that Ireland is\u00a0a physical team and had a tough opening loss\u00a0to\u00a0co-hosts Australia just means that they have nothing to lose in this match. The way that Ireland plays\u00a0 rough has been a huge part of the discourse ahead of Wednesday's game.\n\"We know what we have to do,\" Priestman said of the Irish.\nWATCH: Coach Priestman on why Canada needs to be clear-headed vs. Ireland:\nCanada coach Bev Priestman on why Canada needs to be clear-headed against Ireland\n12 hours ago\nDuration \n1:10\nCanada set to face Ireland at the Women's World Cup,  Wednesday at 8 a.m. ET.\nCanadian forward\u00a0Jordyn Huitema is ready to take on the challenge.\n\"I welcome physicality and I quite enjoy it as a player,\" she said Tuesday in Perth. \"Canada, in general, is a very aggressive physical team so I think that it's going to be a good match up in terms of physicality.\"\nDefender Jayde Riviere echoed her teammate.\n\"A part of our Canadian DNA is to be gritty and to be that kind of team that doesn't let people boss them around,\" Riviere said. \"I think we'll be fine when we play against Ireland. Like I said, we played against Nigeria and it's no stranger to us that physicality.\"\u00a0\nA win for Canada is crucial. Canada needs to come out on top to be comfortably placed in Group B. Priestman also alluded to the fact that Ireland is a technically strong team and that breaking them down will not be easy.\u00a0\nAs for the weather, Priestman isn't concerned about a wet pitch.\n\"It will allow us to move the ball, hopefully, which is what we'll need to do,\" she said. \"It doesn't change a whole lot.\"\nWatch Soccer North Live Wednesday July 26th at 10:30 am ET on\u00a0\ncbcsports.ca\n\u00a0and the CBC Sports YouTube Channel for post-match analysis of Canada vs. Ireland with Andi Petrillo and Diana Matheson.\n\"For me, specifically, I grew up in 'Raincouver' so I'm always used to the rain,\"\u00a0said the B.C.-born Huitema. \"I like playing in it. It doesn't change much. I think everybody was wearing their six studs [cleats] a little bit at the beginning of training just to work them in \u2014 getting ready for [Wednesday.]\"\nPriestman describes Ireland as a team with \"heart, spirit and passion\" and they have a massive group of supporters that also have those same qualities.\u00a0\nWATCH: Ashley Lawrence on lessons learned from draw with Nigeria:\nAshley Lawrence talks lessons learned in draw against Nigeria at Women's World Cup\n12 hours ago\nDuration \n1:10\nThe Canadian defender also looks ahead to their second match of the tournament against Ireland.\nCanada's Jessie Fleming expected to play in Wednesday's pivotal match vs. Ireland at Women's World Cup\nROUNDUP\nPhilippines shocks co-host New Zealand for its first win at Women's World Cup\nOpinion\nNouhaila Benzina and Morocco blazing a path of inclusion at Women's World Cup\nThe Irish community that resides in Perth is robust. A local journalist told me that the Perth Rectangular Stadium (capacity 20,500) is sold out and between 80-90 per cent of the fans will be Irish. In the last 15 years, thousands of Irish have moved to Western Australia. There are Facebook groups, community centres and even an organization that helps Irish people who need social service supports.\u00a0\nThe \nIrish Heritage\n group's website says in bold and italic on the website that they are \"non-sectarian, non-political and\u00a0empathically Australian.\" The mission of the group is to develop sources of Irish history, disseminate, amplify, honour and celebrate achievements.\u00a0\nCanada's Jessie Fleming, who missed the team's scoreless draw with Nigeria on Thursday with an unspecified injury, was practising fully and is expected to play. Kadeisha Buchanan was missing from training but\u00a0Priestman\u00a0said her absence was precautionary\u00a0and she expected to see her in the lineup on Wednesday.\nOfficial update from Bev: <br><br>Buchanan was held of training with an illness. It was precautionary. Priestman sounds hopeful Buchanan will be able to play on Wednesday night vs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IRL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#IRL</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFAWWC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FIFAWWC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ZZKYAjYb7W\">https://t.co/ZZKYAjYb7W</a>\n&mdash;\n@HarJournalist\nThe conditions should not affect the players but the huge number of Irish supporters will be interesting. Playing in front of crowds is not new because in their first match, Nigerian fans overpowered Canadian supporters.\nAfter this match, Canada will face Australia, the beloved home team in their final group stage game on Monday. It is fair to say that Canada will have to fight not just the wet terrain but the resounding voices of support for their opponents. Mental toughness and preparedness will be as key as defensive and offensive maneuvering.\u00a0 ",

Journalists are using access to information laws, and in some cases court challenges, to obtain discipline records and data.\nOver the last four years, municipal police officers on Prince Edward Island have been the subject of dozens of complaints from members of the public.\u00a0\nUnlike the other Atlantic provinces, the website for P.E.I 's police commissioner includes summaries of all complaints the office receives.\n\"We want the public to know these are the nature of the complaints that we're receiving and here's the manner in which they've been handled, so that the public hopefully will have confidence in the work that's done by police and the work that's done by this office,\"\u00a0 P.E.I. police Commissioner Cindy Wedge said.\nP.E.I.'s police oversight system is considered to be one of the better systems in Canada, according to Temitope Oriola, a criminologist at the University of Alberta and a special advisor to the Alberta government when it carried out a recent review of its Police Act.\u00a0\n\"In an environment where all these are pretty much on the C-minus and below level, P.E.I. would be considered one of the better ones, if you can believe it,\" he said.\n\"However, that's when comparing it with much worse climates.\"\nTemitope Oriola is a professor of criminology at the University of Alberta who was an advisor to the Alberta government when it carried out a review of its Police Act.\n \n(CBC)\nBut when you compare P.E.I.'s system internationally, it gets a failing grade, Oriola said.\n\"It's not even close to what is the industry standard,\" he said.\n\"It is far behind, and by multiple decades, what should be happening.\"\nImportance of transparency\nCBC's Atlantic investigative unit has launched a project called Police and Public Trust, which takes a closer look at systems of police complaints and discipline across the region.\nOn P.E.I., part of this work includes taking a look at how the province's system measures up against other jurisdictions beyond Atlantic Canada to find out what the Island is getting right \u2014 and where it can do better.\u00a0\n10% of complaints against P.E.I. police in years leading up to 2023 substantiated, records show\nDanielle Robitaille is a managing partner at Henein Hutchison Robitaille LLP in Toronto and acted as lead counsel in Ontario's Independent Police Oversight Review in 2017.\u00a0\nShe said the recommendations that came out of that review focused on the importance of transparency and independence while handling complaints against police.\u00a0\nShe said one of the key components for a healthy oversight system is a feeling of legitimacy among the public. If there's a public sentiment that there's an effort to conceal or cover up evidence or information, that can distort and disturb the public's overall feeling of trust in the oversight system, she added.\u00a0\nLawyer Danielle Robitaille served as senior counsel in Ontario's Independent Police Oversight Review and said key components for a healthy police oversight system are transparency and public trust. \n \n(Brittany Spencer/CBC )\n\"We're talking about someone who has the power and authority to, in some cases, exercise lethal force against a member of the public,\" Robitaille said.\n\"The thought from people who study these issues, including several scholars, is that you really, really require an independent, transparent and accountable system to oversee these people who are doing this vital and important work in the public interest.\"\nInvestigations should be done independent of police\nOriola pointed to Norway as one country with a strong police oversight regime. He said its system stands out because the country recognizes that police officers tend to know each other and shouldn't investigate each other.\u00a0\nHe said the country also grades well for making it easy for people to access the complaint process, including access to when meetings are held and publication of findings.\n\"They give regular updates to individuals,\" he said.\n\"They set strict timelines on when results should be out and all of that. So they have taken care of the constellation of small things, which add up to make them a very strong and highly self-reflective organization.\"\nOn P.E.I., people can submit a complaint to either the police agency or the police commission. If it relates to a criminal allegation, the attorney general can assign an independent investigator, such as\u00a0another police service or the Serious Incident Response Team in Nova Scotia.\u00a0\nWATCH | How to file a complaint against police on Prince Edward Island:\nHow to file a complaint against police on P.E.I.\n6 days ago\nDuration \n2:42\nCBC P.E.I. has been taking a closer look at complaints filed against police officers over the past four years. Brittany Spencer breaks down how that process works.\nIf it's a code of conduct complaint, the police agency will investigate, with the chief of police deciding the outcome. Complainants or officers can ask the police commission to review the case if they're unhappy.\nAn independent civilian-led agency, not the police force, should always investigate a complaint from the public, Oriola said.\n\"We know that police culture is very insular and there's a tendency toward\u00a0protecting one another and all of that, so they have no business investigating themselves in those circumstances,\" he said.\nCBC Investigates\nCBC project reveals never-before-seen details of allegations of police wrongdoing\nSummerside Deputy Police Chief Jason Blacquiere said he understands the concern about police investigating police, but questioned whether a change would be feasible.\n\"We want the public to trust us, we want them to work with us, and so there has to be that transparency,\" Blacquiere said.\u00a0\n\"In P.E.I. we're lucky, I think, to say that there are so few complaints compared to other larger provinces that it's probably impractical to fund a unit to solely investigate police on a full-time basis.\"\nTracking more data\u00a0\nCBC analyzed more than 50 complaints against municipal police officers on P.E.I., compiling data posted on the police commission's website.\nThe majority of complaints \u2014 about 52 per cent \u2014 were unfounded or unsubstantiated. In these cases it's typically more difficult to get details about what happened, which is something criminologists say is common across the country.\u00a0\n\"If a complaint is unfounded, generally across Canada, you're not going to get any information about what goes into that,\" said Erick Laming, assistant professor of criminology at Trent University.\u00a0\nCBC Investigates\nHow freedom of information laws help crack 'culture of secrecy' on police accountability\nHe said in cases that are founded or that go to some kind of hearing, information becomes more accessible to the public, but the vast majority of complaints across Canada are unfounded.\n\"It's the cases that don't get to that point that we always are kind of left thinking, what happened? That's the unfortunate thing. I don't think there's a consensus across researchers or even police practitioners or investigators of what information should be put out there in those types of cases, just because the majority of complaints are unfounded to begin with.\"\n'It can open doors'\n\u00a0\nP.E.I.'s police commission has also moved away from naming police agencies in its summaries, citing privacy concerns for small police forces.\nWedge, the police commissioner, said her office aims to strike a balance between the public's right to know about complaints and protecting the privacy of police officers.\u00a0\nShe said that means the office won't publish the name of the officer and in some cases won't identify the police service involved in a complaint.\u00a0\n\"In previous years we have listed police agencies that employed the officer. We intend to change that and we're removing that information into the future because of the, in some cases, very small sizes of the agencies that we oversee,\" Wedge said.\nLaming said the fact that complaint summaries on P.E.I. are posted online means the province is taking positive steps to make that information available to the public.\u00a0\nBut he said P.E.I. can go further.\u00a0\n'If a complaint is unfounded, generally across Canada, you\u2019re not going to get any information about what goes into that,' says Erick Laming, assistant professor of criminology at Trent University. \n \n(Submitted by Erick Laming)\nLaming pointed to police complaint agencies in B.C. and Ontario that publish more detailed annual reports. They include data about complaints along with demographic information about the complainant, such as\u00a0age, gender and ethnicity, which can make it easier to track patterns or trends among complaints.\u00a0\n\"It can open doors into understanding more of the kind of the people who are complaining and we can get a better picture of\u00a0are there systemic issues that are involved,\" Laming said.\u00a0\nP.E.I.'s Department of Justice and Public Safety provided CBC News with a statement that said data collection regarding police complaints has been discussed with counterparts in other provinces and territories. It goes on to say that many of the provinces collecting specific demographic information like age or race-based data are larger and have more resources to do so. The province didn't say whether it would begin collecting this data moving forward.\u00a0\nThe province said it will continue to \"assess the current landscape and work with jurisdictional partner organizations to identify what is best for P.E.I.\"\nOn mobile?\u00a0\nClick here\n\u00a0to send us your tip about police complaints.",

        "summary": "Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan's new biopic, is an astounding testament to the possibilities of Hollywood and film. It soars highest, though, when predicting an uncomfortably apocalyptic future.",
        "content": "There are few figures in American history as mythologized as J. Robert Oppenheimer \u2014 in no small part due to the man himself.\u00a0\nSo building a cohesive story about him \u2014 the physicist who helped define an entire scientific field so new and arcane it was called \n\"boys' physics\"\n; the precocious child-genius who delivered a \nscientific lecture at 12\n; the prideful, self-promoting \nfather of the atomic bomb;\n the financial supporter of both \ncommunists\n and \nJewish victims of the Nazis\n; the forgetful and rude philanderer whose first media attention came from leaving a woman stranded in a car on a mountain peak\u00a0as he \nwalked home and went to sleep\n \u2014 is, if nothing else, a feat of economy.\u00a0\nAmerican Prometheus\n, the biography upon which Christopher Nolan's \nOppenheimer \nis based, took 25 years and\u00a0600 pages to describe it all. If you asked Nolan, he'd probably be proud he cut it down to three hours.\u00a0\nWATCH | Oppenheimer trailer:\n\u00a0\nThe way he achieves it is a testament to that story, as well as to what the dying world of Hollywood can produce when championed by an auteur.\nBecause as it follows the harried physicist (played by\u00a0Cillian Murphy) through his early days of self discovery, a\u00a0successful career in quantum physics, to his management of\u00a0the Manhattan Project and\u00a0eventual pillorying by the government, \nOppenheimer \ndoesn't concern itself with a classically satisfying character arc.\nInstead, it uses Oppenheimer\u00a0as a static\u00a0and ultimately tragic\u00a0beacon\u00a0to examine how hopelessly doomed the nuclear age has left us.\u00a0\nThat both elevates\u00a0\nOppenheimer \ninto something more than just another biopic and threatens\u00a0to make it difficult to access. Because while \nOppenheimer \nwill likely be remembered as one of the best popular films of the decade, the careful and incisive character study is worlds apart from the \nDunkirk\n-style, visual war-spectacle it's been billed as.\nComplicated by its incredible fidelity to historical fact, slightly hurt by an overabundance of stars\u00a0and triumphant in its performances, \nOppenheimer \nis an extraordinary movie both because of and in spite of its morose complexity.\u00a0\nWATCH | What's the deal with 'Barbenheimer?':\u00a0\nWhat is \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019? The cultural phenomenon, explained\n7 days ago\nDuration \n1:47\nWith Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer set to hit theatres on July 21, CBC's Ashley Fraser unpacks why the two films have become a cultural phenomenon spawning memes, T-shirts and double-feature plans.\nWhen it comes to deciding whether \nOppenheimer\u00a0\nis deserving of\u00a0attention, though, the first question is practical. Ever since his \nDark Knight \ntrilogy, Nolan has long had an affinity for filming in the Imax format, leaving audiences struggling to decide which of the various screenings his movies warrant.\nUnfortunately, there are only six theatres in Canada capable of screening \nOppenheimer \nin the Imax\u00a070mm format Nolan made the movie for. While the director recommends a\u00a070mm screening if you can't find an Imax 70MM one, and Imax recommends seeing it in any Imax\u00a0format possible, it hasn't stopped debate between fans over which is best. And as that debate grows, it\u00a0only\u00a0serves to fuel the misconception that\u00a0\nOppenheimer\n\u00a0is\u00a0a typical WWII\u00a0movie held up by fantastic visuals.\nWhile there are beautiful, \nTree of Life\n-esque moments showing particles and waves, most of \nOppenheimer\u00a0\nis told in boardrooms, laboratories and parks. Depending on which format you watch it in, you may feel more immersed \u2014 but those who expect to feel the full power of \nSaving Private Ryan\n's beach storming scenes, or are just excited for a big Imax\u00a0boom, will likely feel let down.\nLISTEN | Historian John Hunner on the enigma of Oppenheimer:\n\u00a0\nThe Current\n10:13\nUnpacking the Oppenheimer enigma\nA blockbuster biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer hits cinemas today. We talk to a historian about the physicist\u2019s role in the creation of the world's first atomic bomb \u2014 and why his legacy continues to shape the world.\nInstead, \nOppenheimer \nworks almost as a diptych \u2014 an artwork split into two halves that, while separate, inform one another. Here, it feels like two movies\u00a0with two messages.\u00a0The first is the more typical: the tortured genius\u00a0enlisted into a secretive government project to win the war by Matt Damon's gruff Lt.-Gen.\u00a0Leslie Groves.\u00a0\nDamon is only the first of a host of familiar faces to pop up in the background. Everyone from Casey Affleck, to Josh Peck, to Josh Hartnett to\u00a0Florence Pugh\u00a0show up in the dust-whorled backgrounds to, at times, break the immersion.\nThe beginning\u00a0of the movie\u00a0operates\u00a0more as a clip show than establishing sequence, as we spend nearly 45 minutes following a flatly affected Oppenheimer, dutifully detailing the early events of his life without much character development.\u00a0\nThat said, those events are impressively faithful to history: yes, U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson really did save the Japanese city of Kyoto from bombing because he enjoyed holidaying there, and Oppenheimer really did read all three volumes of \nDas Kapital \nin German.\u00a0\nMurphy, centre, appears in a still from Oppenheimer. The movie was filmed in both black and white and colour.\n \n(Universal Pictures)\nOppenheimer deconstructed\nBut it's the second half of the movie\u00a0where \nOppenheimer \nreally\u00a0earns its accolades. After successfully building the bomb, Oppenheimer is plagued by guilt\u00a0and made to grapple with his past communist leanings through protracted security hearings born\u00a0of the \"red scare\" McCarthyism\u00a0era in the U.S.\nThose concerns, along with guilt over his rampant infidelity, produce some of the most compelling scenes. As in Pablo Larrain's criminally underrated \nSpencer\n, Oppenheimer's world breaks around him\u00a0into metaphorical symbols and hallucinations \u2014 revealing the inner psyche of the man\u00a0as it crumbles in on itself. As he is forced to celebrate his achievement among\u00a0an ecstatic crowd, Oppenheimer is suddenly stepping into a cracked and burned\u00a0corpse. As he is forced to describe his affairs in front of a government hearing and his own wife, he is suddenly naked and with her as the committee continues on.\u00a0\nThese scenes also bring up, surprisingly, the strongest conflict in a film about a world war: eccentric genius Oppenheimer versus the vindictive, jealous naval officer and then nominee for U.S. Secretary of Commerce Lewis Strauss, played by Robert Downey Jr.\u00a0\nAnalysis\nHiroshima's tragic legacy a reminder of potential dangers of today's no-limits technologies\nHow the Barbie movie marketing machine tapped into a cultural zeitgeist\nTheir conflict of a\u00a0doomed but brilliant iconoclast taken down by a self-important\u00a0runner-up to their own peril is nothing new: think Mozart and Salieri,\u00a0Alexander\u00a0Hamilton and Aaron Burr or even \nPatch Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman's surly Mitch\n.\u00a0\nHere, though, it's less about the characters than a finding.\u00a0From\u00a0the beginning to Nolan's visually stunning and prophetic end, Oppenheimer never seems able to exert control over where he \u2014\u00a0or humanity as a whole \u2014 is\u00a0headed.\u00a0He is unable to control the outcome of his relationships,\u00a0fight back against the sham hearings against him,\u00a0control\u00a0the use of his weapons, or stop the later development of the even deadlier hydrogen bombs.\u00a0\nWith its fatalistic bent, \nOppenheimer\n is another of the year's pessimistic parables like \nBeau is Afraid\n and \nAsteroid City,\n seemingly plucked right from a public unconscious staring right at an apocalyptic end.\nAs an obviously bleak counter\u00a0to the bright, simultaneous\u00a0release of\u00a0\nBarbie, \nit works as a rumination on America's building up\u00a0and destruction of its heroes\u00a0while wielding\u00a0Oppenheimer himself as a window into America's debate over whether its actions to save the world have ultimately \u2014 and inevitably \u2014 doomed us all.",

But to me, it's absolutely clear that the bishops are committed to doing this.\"\nUnaddressed demands\nSmith said he's encouraged by the work underway. Others say progress has been\u00a0too slow.\n\"Just having an apology without action to help the current generations of the residential school survivors and their children is overall inappropriate,\" said Chelsea Brunelle, a member of Batchewana First Nation in northern Ontario.\n\"It's not the right way to go about reconciliation between the survivors and ancestors and current generations of genocide because we still live in a colonial society and we are still suffering.\"\nBrunelle \nunfurled a large banner that said \"Rescind the Doctrine\"\n\u00a0at a mass the Pope led outside Quebec City last year. She and her cousin Sarain Fox were\u00a0honouring their great-aunt Mary Bell, a survivor of the Spanish Indian Residential School.\nThe banner is a reference to the\u00a0\nDoctrine of Discovery\n, which is\u00a0inspired by centuries-old papal bulls that justified the colonization, conversion and enslavement of non-Christians and the seizure of their lands. Scholars say the doctrine\u00a0laid the foundation for Canada's claim to Indigenous\u00a0lands and the\u00a0Indian Act.\nLast spring, the Vatican repudiated the doctrine by issuing a new statement.\u00a0\nBrunelle said it's not enough.\n\"There still isn't any plan to rescind the Doctrine of Discovery,\" Brunelle said.\u00a0\"That's what I would still request a year later.\"\nBatchewana First Nation members Chelsea Brunelle and Sarain Fox unfurl a banner ahead of a mass at Saint Anne de Beaupre Basillica. \n \n(Sarah Levitt/CBC/Radio-Canada)\nLast year, Irniq asked Pope Francis to personally intervene in the case of Johannes Rivoire, a former Oblate priest who\u00a0\nfaces charges of sexual assault in Canada\n.\n\"They have to get that man back to Canada,\" Irniq said. \"Not doing anything is re-victimizing Rivoire's victims in Canada. That is not acceptable.\"\nDespite \ninternational pressure\n led by Inuit, \nFrance is not extraditing Rivoire\n and it's not clear if Pope Francis has done anything to help in the case.\u00a0\nEven though there are still many demands left unaddressed, Irniq said he still feels inspired by the Pope's historic apology.\nNow\u00a0is the time, he said, for the church to work with residential school survivors on supporting victims of sexual abuse, promoting Indigenous culture and traditions, revitalizing Indigenous languages and making good on promises of financial support.\n\"I am willing. Inuit are willing to move forward with healing and reconciliation with the church,\" Irniq said.\n\"It's your move. It's time for you to make a move \u2026 There is no other way of doing it.\"",

        "content": "From estimating precipitation amounts to screening out non-weather related data, Shuniah's upgraded weather radar station will provide a lot more information to forecasters, Environment Canada said.\nThe weather agency has been upgrading its radar stations across the country for the last few years. The new systems can better detect severe weather at longer ranges\u00a0and allow forecasters to distinguish between types of precipitation more easily.\n\"This radar brings with it a whole series of improvements over the older system,\" explained Geoff Coulson, a warning-preparedness meteorologist with Environment Canada. \"One of those biggest improvements is the older style radars basically scan just horizontally from side to side.\n\"These new radars have what's called dual polarization, which allows them to scan not only side to side, but up and down. And this gives us a lot of benefits in better identifying precipitation types like rain versus snow or freezing rain or hail, and also the better ability to screen out things that aren't related to weather. Things like bugs, birds, or even tornado debris that may be lofted up in the atmosphere.\"\nSevere weather won't affect the signal of the new system to the extent it did the old radar, Coulson said.\n\"What used to happen was, if there was very strong storms near the radar itself, we wouldn't be able to detect storms further away very accurately,\" he said. \"This new radar sort of penetrates those stronger storms closer to the radar, and still gives us an excellent idea of what's happening further away.\"\nCBC Explains\nWhy winter storms are becoming bigger and badder around the Great Lakes \u2014 and what it means for those at risk\nAfter Earth's hottest week on record, extreme weather surprises everyone \u2014 even climate scientists\nCoulson said the upgraded radar was also relocated; previously, it was in the Lasseter Lake area, but the station has been moved\u00a0about 20 to 30 kilometres south of that site.\n\"This new location has less terrain problems in the lower levels,\" he said. \"There was some higher terrain near the Lasseter Lake area that sometimes impacted the radar beams in the lowest levels. This new location doesn't have that problem, and in addition, the new location also is easier for our maintenance crews to get to, so regular maintenance is going to be more straightforward.\"\nThe newly upgraded Shuniah weather radar station has a number of improvements over the previous system, which will allow forecasters to better identify precipitation types.\n \n(Environment and Climate Change Canada/Provided)\nCoulson said the Shuniah radar was the last of the eight Ontario weather radar stations to be upgraded.\n\"This completion of this radar project across Canada has been a real boost for the forecasters. We expect to get benefits in detection of both summer severe weather and winter severe weather.\n\"So hopefully, what we are going to see in the coming months and years is\u00a0the forecasters being able to use these new types of technology to their fullest, and actually learn more\n\"It's allowing us to learn more about these storms, and it's going to be applying that knowledge to help get better forecasts out there that, I\u00a0think, is going to be the real benefit.\"",

Smaller items can be picked up by city staff, but removal of large items, like pianos, is contracted out.\nHowever, council has voted to eliminate that program as of 2024; a report to council states the city will save $20,000 per year by not hiring contractors to pick up the debris.\n'It's a disaster here': Windsor business owner calls for more action against illegal garbage dumping\n\"The way we sort of operated\u00a0with the program is we would try to do as much in-house, with our staff,\u00a0for smaller things, and obviously the program sort of supplemented that,\" Sherband said. \"When\u00a0we get into the larger items,\u00a0we do a significant amount of work with that program in laneways.\"\n\"Sometimes, in certain parts of the community,\u00a0lanes are\u00a0littered with with garbage and debris, and so that program utilized clean up of of those areas,\" he said. \"With the program being gone, we're certainly going to have to reevaluate next year how we would deal with this.\"\n\"We don't have a means to supplement what we were doing in-house, and so we're going to have to put our minds together and how we would deal with that, because as we sit here today,\u00a0I don't know how we will.\"\nDan Cheal, owner of Junk Away\u00a0\u2014 the company that the city contracts for large debris removal\u00a0\u2014 said his crews didn't get called out that often.\n\"They run it in such a way where if they don't get a series of complaints about it, they're not proactive, they don't do anything about it,\" Cheal said. \"I don't get called as as much as I should on that project.\"\nHowever, Cheal said he doesn't think residents realize the full extent of the problem in Thunder Bay.\n\"It's not just in one area or one general area,\" he said. \"It's all over town.\"\nCheal said his company has removed plenty of furniture, including couches and mattresses, and bags of garbage from various spots in the city.\n\"If you want to talk about tourism, put yourself in somebody's shoes wanting to come to Thunder Bay,\" he said. \"Could you imagine coming here from southern Ontario or from the states, and you've got mattresses and dressers and garbage all over the road?\n\"I don't see the the value of getting rid of the program.\"\nSherband said the city doesn't actively track incidents of illegal dumping, and didn't have information in terms of the number of people that had been fined for dumping garbage on city property.\nWhile \nsome other municipalities have turned to portable cameras to help them catch illegal dumpers\n, Thunder Bay has not yet considered that option, Sherband said.\nHowever, Cheal said the city should consider turning its focus to people who offer dump runs.\n\"Once they figure out that\u00a0there's a lot of expenses involved with doing this, and they can't afford to pay the dump fees,\u00a0they will just take it and dump it on [Mission Island]\u00a0somewhere, or on a country road.:\n\"It happens all the time and we see it.\"",

        "title": "Ontario's expanding access to authenticate official documents, but advocates say that doesn't go far enough",
        "summary": "The Ontario government announced last week a simplified process to authenticate official documents such as birth certificates. But advocates say it doesn't make the application process any easier.",
        "content": "The Ontario government has announced it is\u00a0simplifying the process to authenticate officials documents, but an advocate\u00a0in Thunder Bay\u00a0believes\u00a0the recent changes won't\u00a0actually make the application process any easier for most people.\nThe province will expand in-person services to four ServiceOntario locations across the province, including one in\u00a0Thunder Bay and one in Sault Ste. Marie. The expansion aims to save people time and money as they look to authenticate officials documents like birth certificates, required for international use.\u00a0\n\"When you get down to the nitty gritty of the announcement, it's actually the authentication process that has become simpler, and the authentication is only necessary if you're traveling abroad,\" said\u00a0Katie Watson, community navigator with\u00a0Roots Community Food Centre.\nIn addition to food access programs, Roots Community Food Centre in Thunder Bay\u00a0runs free monthly birth certificate clinics for people below the poverty line or who face barriers when trying to access this document. Employees help individuals fill out applications and submit them on their behalf.\nWatson helps to lead\u00a0the birth certificate clinics.\u00a0She said the Ontario government's new process doesn't make applying for birth certificates less complicated, and will only help people in certain scenarios.\u00a0\n\"The process of getting the birth certificate is still exactly the same. It's just that once you have the certificate, you now have more resources to get it authenticated,\" Watson said.\u00a0\nIn a news release issued earlier this month, the province said expanding the authentication process puts customers first and will save time and money.\n\"Whether someone is preparing for a major life event, a new job or an adventure abroad, authenticating documents for international use is often a crucial and time-sensitive matter,\" said Kaleed Rasheed, minister of public and business service delivery.\u00a0\nNumerous barriers to access birth certificates\nWatson said Roots Community Food Centre started the birth certificate clinics after she helped employees with their applications and realized how many barriers exist\u00a0to access the document.\n\"We decided to sort of shift our focus a little bit to make it more accessible to the wider community,\" she said.\nLast year, researchers with Lakehead University,\u00a0Kinna-aweya Legal Clinic and the NorWest Community Health Centres published \na three-year study which surveyed 600 people in Thunder Bay seeking identification\n. It found barriers such as cost, bureaucracy, accessibility, and health are making the process inaccessible.\nWatson said the birth certificate application is \"quite cumbersome,\" as there are questions listed that most people don't know the answers to.\n\"It asks questions about your weight at birth, the address that your mother lived at when you were born. Just questions that become potentially quite overwhelming if you don't know the answers.\"\nIdentity documentation is northwestern Ontario's 'invisible problem,' researchers say\nBirth certificate for wrong child sent to Calgary mother after applying for passports\nAs well, Watson said not having all the information to answer the questions on the application is a barrier.\n\"It's projected as a way of needing to know all of these details in order to prove who you are, who you say you are,\" she said.\n\"The application itself is already a barrier because there are\u00a0so many questions on it that, should you have any estrangement from your mother, maybe she's passed, maybe you're adopted. Just all of these different real life, lived experiences that might impact your ability to have the answers or feel confident about the answers you have,\" Watson said.\u00a0\nWatson added the application fee can be a barrier for those who can't afford to pay it or are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\"That extra $35 is a barrier in itself, especially when you need [your birth certificate]\u00a0to get literally every other form of documentation. So a birth certificate is sort of the baseline to get your driver's license, to get your health card, to get to a food bank. You need it for everything. So we've established that it's a necessary document.\"\nWorking to make the process easier\nWatson said Roots Community Food Centre meets monthly with the\u00a0ID Advocacy Group\u00a0to advocate for changes to the official document application process. She said Service Canada, Service Ontario and the Office of the Registrar General attend the meetings as observers and to answer questions.\n\"We brought lots of different areas of the application where if you change this one thing that would make it easier. And so far nothing has been changed,\" said Watson.\nSince the Ontario government's announcement of the new authentication process, Watson said a few group members communicated with the government to say the statement on the process was portrayed differently than how it's intended to work.\nFamily wants names of both mothers on child's birth certificate; province says change is needed\n\"The word 'simplification' led us to believe that something had shifted in terms of the application, but it actually hasn't,\" she said.\nWatson\u00a0said more needs to be done to achieve a simplification of the birth certificate process. She said the application fee should be eliminated and the paper and online applications should be identical to one another.\n\"We do the paper copy with someone and then input it online, but the wording is different [on the online application]. So you have to be very careful that you're not putting things in incorrectly because they don't translate the same.\"\nWatson added the Ontario government doesn't recognize kinship agreements, which is when a child is placed in the care of a family member or an individual who the child is familiar with. As a result, Watson said a child in a kinship agreement can't access their birth certificate because the document requires the adult applying for the child to be their biological parents, a legal guardian or a parent named on the birth certificate.\n\"The kinship agreement is already in place,\" said Watson.\u00a0\"It's already been established by the child welfare agency, the family members and, in every other sort of realm, it is considered that they have legal guardianship. Except when they apply for the birth certificate. So by recognizing kinship agreements as legal guardianship, we would be able to get a lot more people their birth certificates.\"\nWatson said the\u00a0ID Advocacy Group will meet again in August\u00a0and plans to bring its concerns about the new authentication process forward to the Ontario government.",

A recent powwow in Thunder Bay, Ont., with people from nearby\u00a0First Nations has helped evacuees care for their physical and mental well-being.",
        "content": "Nearly three weeks after being forced from their homes, evacuees from Eabametoong First Nation in northwestern Ontario are\u00a0finding ways to cope, including by taking\u00a0care of their physical and mental well-being.\u00a0\nThe remote Ojibway First Nation\u00a0of about 1,600 people is approximately 360 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. Though it has been under a long-term boil-water advisory since 2002, it has been in a state of emergency since a fire broke out at the Eabametoong First Nation Water Treatment Plant\u00a0on July 5, leaving no access to safe drinking water.\u00a0\nMore than\u00a0700 people were forced from their homes and most\u00a0have been staying in Thunder Bay. But with no more available space in that city, over\u00a0300 are\u00a0in Niagara Falls.\nOn Monday, evacuees in Thunder Bay held a powwow with people from other nearby\u00a0First Nations communities\u00a0to dance, sing and demonstrate\u00a0support as they await a report on the status of the water treatment plant.\u00a0\nWhile the powwow was a last-minute decision, many people attended to support Eabametoong First Nation evacuees. Chief Solomon Atlookan says he held the powwow to bring everyone together.\n \n(Taylor O'Brien/CBC)\nEabametoong Chief Solomon Atlookan said it was\u00a0tremendous seeing so many people come together to show support.\n\"There were a lot of dancers out there this evening and our people mingling around, our little kids dancing as well.\"\nHe said deciding to host the powwow was a last-minute decision.\n\"It's one of those things, I thought, 'I just wanted to bring everyone together and meet people from outside\" the Eabametoong community.\"\nLoss of water,\u00a0evacuation difficult\u00a0\nFor some community members, being away from home for an extended period has taken a toll on their mental health.\nMelanie Waswa has been in Thunder Bay with her family since July 9. She said things have been hectic since she and her family were\u00a0displaced.\n\"I've been working since I got out here, so it's been tough having to serve our people and manage your own family while being separated from the other half of your family.\"\nShaylyne Waboose, 21, has also been staying in Thunder Bay the last\u00a0few weeks with her siblings because of the evacuation. She said her family experienced skin irritations in Eabametoong First Nation\u00a0as a result\u00a0of the water crisis.\n\"My nieces and nephews' skins have eczema and they've been\u00a0flaring up. But once they came out here [to Thunder Bay], they started improving with water.\"\nEvacuations continue as Eabametoong First Nation remains without running water\nOntario First Nation hires outside firm to investigate 28-year boil water advisory\nWaboose added that her family said it was depressing not having running water\u00a0for bathing\u00a0or to clean their home.\n\"I couldn't shower, I couldn't wash dishes to eat and I couldn't wash my clothes. And I couldn't feel good, so it made me feel depressed or ugly.\"\nWaboose said now that she's\u00a0washing her clothes in Thunder Bay, she's been feeling better about herself\u00a0and it makes her happy to see her family wash their babies and siblings.\nAtlookan, also in Thunder Bay with other evacuees, said people were excited to come to the city because of the running water and amenities. Despite the \"little hiccups\" along the way, he said, things have been going well.\n\"You're always going to get a few situations here and there when you put a lot of people together in one building, so that just happened, but I think that's something that our group managed very well.\"\nFederal ministers meet with community leadership\nThunder Bay MP and Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu\u00a0and Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Marc Miller met with community leadership\u00a0Monday. They\u00a0went to\u00a0the powwow to share words of encouragement with the\u00a0evacuees.\nHajdu said Indigenous Services Canada can support communities through the Emergency Management Assistance Program during various crises, including evacuations in Eabametoong.\n\"It's still really stressful for communities to be evacuated, regardless of the reason,\" she said.\u00a0\nHajdu said Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) will work with the First Nation community to ensure they have enough funds to pay for accommodations, and receive transportation and health services for evacuees if needed.\n\"In this case, it really is assuring to the community that we'll be there with the financial and the practical supports so that they can use that principle self determination to protect their members during this difficult time.\"\u00a0\nLiberal MP Patty Hajdu and Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Marc Miller, left and middle, share words of encouragement to evacuees from Eabametoong First Nation. Hajdu says Indigenous Services Canada is working closely with the community and its leaders to ensure they have the services they need.\n \n(Taylor O'Brien/CBC)\nIn addition, Hajdu said,\u00a0ISC will help Eabametoong First Nation as long as they need it\u00a0and in a way the community\u00a0determines is\u00a0best for them.\n\"In the past, that would be very much the department deciding for the community what would be allowed and not allowed,\" said Hajdu.\n\"And now the concept is communities know what's best for them, and we work in partnership with communities to fill those gaps. It might be cash, it might be cash flow, it might be specific people or resources, but we are there for the community and we're there for the long term.\"\nHajdu said she hopes evacuees can return home soon. She also\u00a0said ISC will be there to support them if they can't.\u00a0\n\"Obviously people want to go home and home is where people's hearts are, and it's the best-case scenario for the community to go home as soon as possible.\"\u00a0\nOji-Cree First Nation frustrated as majority of community members ineligible for drinking-water settlement\n18-year water crisis in Eabametoong First Nation 'would not be tolerated' anywhere else, chief says\nWaswa said the evacuees have received many different supports in Thunder Bay, such as us through\u00a0health clinics and recreation to boost mental health.\n\"I know all of us come together every time a crisis happens,\" Waboose\u00a0said. \"It feels good to know that they're there for us.\"\nAtlookan\u00a0said he's satisfied with\u00a0the support\u00a0his community has received\u00a0and they're in a good spot for the time being.\u00a0\n\"Initially there were quite a few things that we were in need of,\" he said. \"As far as bodies in the community that are assisting and helping out, we've got numerous people coming from different organizations helping out there. So that has gone very well\u00a0and I'm very grateful for that.\"",

The Festival of Colours consisted of Indian cuisine and music, along with interactive dances and performers.\nMany took part in the anticipated colour-throwing portions of the festival, where attendees threw bright\u00a0powders into the air. The dust filled the waterfront skies with a colourful haze and turned the Marina Park's green grass into a rainbow.\nThe majority of people entered the event wearing white shirts and clothes, but left covered head to toe in multicoloured powders.\nBoth festivals have been happening in Thunder Bay for more than a decade.\nThis was Nita Joseph's first time attending the Festival of Colours. She said it\u00a0was fun and she loved throwing colours on\u00a0her friends.\nJoseph said she is South Indian but was raised Canadian, which was one of the reasons she decided to go to the event.\nThroughout the Festival of India, numerous dancers perform and some lead interactive sessions where attendees can learn Indian dance moves.\n \n(Taylor O'Brien/CBC)\n\"I just feel like it's important to find fun in north Indian culture and different Indian cultures, or any other culture. I personally would find it fun,\" she said.\nDr. Prashant Jani, the Festival of India and Festival of Colours organizer in Thunder Bay, said more than 2,000 people attended the Festival of India on Saturday and he expected more than 3,000 people at the Festival of Colours.\nJani said both days of the festival were spectacular and many people enjoyed the colour-throwing portions of the event.\n\"[Attendees can expect] lots of joy, laughter, smiles, happiness and fun,\" he said.\nFestival a thousands-of-year-old tradition in India\nHoli, an annual Hindu festival\n to honour the god Krishna, is celebrated to mark the arrival of spring and the end of winter.

Gambhir said Holi is a\u00a0big festival in India, so she was looking forward to taking part in Thunder Bay's event.\nCarol Berry, Jyotika Gambhir and Mukul Sharma, left to right, attend the Festival of Colours on Sunday afternoon. This was Sharma's second time attending the event, while it was Berry and Gambhir's first.\n \n(Taylor O'Brien/CBC)\n\"We are from India, so in India we celebrate Holi in the month of March,\" she said. \"Because of snow they are having this festival here in July, so we were so excited to celebrate Holi in Thunder Bay.\"\nJani said the reason the Festival of Colours is so significant to Thunder Bay is because of the different elements it offers.\n\"People love colours, music, dance and food, of course, so it's a perfect combination. And lots of community members support us, volunteers help us, so it's a wonderful event.\"\nLocal community support\nThis year marked Sharma's second time attending the\u00a0Festival of Colours,\u00a0and he expressed his excitement over the event.\n\"I'm just loving it,\" he said. \"This feeling is great, especially the environment we get here.\u00a0Everybody enjoys it. So that's the best feeling you can get. In the summer, it's good everywhere, just go and take [in the feeling]. It's really great.\"\nSharma said he loves the support of Thunder Bay's local community at the festival.\nCelebrating Holi \u2014 the Hindu festival of colours\nPhotos\nHoli celebrations bring a splash of colour to Fanshawe students\n\"[The Festival of Colours]\u00a0makes your feelings exaggerate\u00a0everything, so you feel very enthusiastic and [full of energy]. And the food, and plus the support, is always good. I [am] always excited to see everything new, whatever comes here. I always love [the event].\"\nFor Berry, attending the Festival of Colours for the first time with Gambhir and Sharma allowed her to learn about Holi.\n\"I'm just happy to celebrate with friends who explain what it means to them at home, to be able to share that. Now I want to go to India in March for Holi.\"",

Bacteria likely bred in that water before flowing\u00a0into the\u00a0ocean around the beaches.\nIf there isn't a lot of wind\u00a0and\u00a0waves, Hatcher said\u00a0freshwater will float on top\u00a0of the saltwater.

That\u00a0region has also been experiencing\u00a0higher than average\u00a0rainfall.\nIs this our future?\nHatcher said climate change is contributing to the problem. While bacteria like enterococcus\u00a0ordinarily die quickly in the ocean's cold salty waters,\u00a0rising temperatures cause bacteria to breed faster.\u00a0\nThe Nova Scotia government predicts rainfall in the province will increase by 10 per cent by the end of the century, boosting\u00a0the odds of overloading wastewater systems.\nLast weekend, Nova Scotia experienced nearly unprecedented\u00a0rains, resulting in widespread flooding in many parts of the province. Preliminary numbers suggest\u00a0it was\u00a0the \nheaviest rainfall\n since 1971. The\u00a0downpours were\u00a0preceded by Nova Scotia's\u00a0\nrainiest start\n to summer in 14 years.\nOcean temperatures are also rising, which can fuel more intense downpours. Last year, the Atlantic Ocean had \nrecord-high temperatures\n.\nJanice Bohan, who grew up in Halifax and now spends about half the\u00a0summer in Nova Scotia visiting family,\u00a0said she's never seen Queensland Beach closed before.\nShe was going to visit the beach two weeks ago when her plans were abruptly cancelled.\n\"My daughter's friend called her from the beach and said, 'Don't bother coming. We just got pulled out of the water. They're closing the beach due to high counts of E. coli.'\u00a0So we were like totally disappointed,\" Bohan\u00a0said.\nMaureen Moore has owned Lola's Landing for 16 years.

She's owned Lola's Landing, a shop near Queensland Beach, for 16 years.\u00a0And\u00a0when the beach is closed, she has half as many customers.\u00a0\n\"If you're not out to the beach, you don't go for ice cream afterward and you don't go for dinner,\" she said.\nQueensland Beach was closed in 2018 and 2020 because of bacteria counts. It was also closed in 2020 because of a possible shark sighting.\u00a0\nBayswater was closed because of bacteria counts in 2013, and Mavillette Beach was closed in 2018 for the same reason.\nHatcher said coastal beach closures will become more common\u00a0as climate change progresses\u00a0and more people move to the coast.\nHow to spot warning signs\nThe Nova Scotia government contracts the Lifesaving Society of Nova Scotia to test the 24 beaches it lifeguards.\nBut what about the others?\nHatcher said there are some things you can watch out for:\u00a0developed land adjacent to a\u00a0beach,\u00a0ponds behind\u00a0a beach that leak into the ocean, and calm water along the shore.\nIf a nearby\u00a0pond smells like rotten eggs, he said that's a warning sign. He also suggests asking locals what the swimming conditions are like.\u00a0\nBut Hatcher said the fact that the province is testing some beaches is a good thing.\n\"It is an indication of how good government pays attention to the risks involved in having lots of human beings doing their business around the coast, where we also like to play and we like to harvest our food.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\n\u00a0\nBody of 52-year-old man, unidentified human remains, recovered after devastating N.S. floods\nNova Scotians seek answers on what flooding damage is covered by their insurance\nCBRM says earthen berms helped reduce flooding in Sydney after rainy weekend\nVideo\nHelicopter used in dramatic N.S. flood rescue\nVideo\nFlooding in N.S. traps rescuers who find themselves needing to be rescued",

        "content": "While parts of Nova Scotia were left submerged by a\u00a0powerful weekend rainstorm, controversial earthern berms are being credited with reducing the impact\u00a0in Sydney.\nThe Wash Brook that runs through the Baille Ard Forest and a south end residential neighbourhood \nflooded seven years ago\n, costing the provincial government about $15 million and the Cape Breton Regional Municipality nearly $5 million and causing 18 homes to be torn down.\nOver the weekend, water in the\u00a0brook spilled over the\u00a0banks, but\u00a0didn't flood the streets as it did on Thanksgiving Day in 2016, when more than 225 millimetres of rain fell in one day.\nSome people objected last year\n when the municipality started removing trees and digging\u00a0up mounds of earth to create the large berms to hold back excess water, saying it would ruin the trails and have little effect on flooding.\nBut Baille Ard Recreation Association president David Gabriel said the berms have\u00a0proven their worth.\n\"I'd say that the berms were doing something, because the water that we were seeing on the trails didn't seem to have affected the downstream, which was the whole point,\" he said.\nEven though some gravel had washed away on paths, that didn't stop people from walking the Baille Ard trail system.\n \n(Tom Ayers/CBC)\nCBRM has \nspent about $4 million on flood mitigation measures\n, including outlet controls on two lakes upstream and the construction of the berms.\nOver the past weekend, some parts of Nova Scotia received more than 200 millimetres of rain in under a day, while some areas of CBRM received up to 150 millimetres of rain over 48 hours.\nGabriel said he wasn't sure whether the weekend flooding in the forest caused any damage on the trails.\nHe said it looked like the water was being held back by the berms, but that it was also spilling back into the brook.\n\"I'm a bit puzzled by that,\" he said. \"I thought that the water would be held and gradually be allowed to go back into the brook, but I'll have to talk to the engineering department in CBRM to see if I just misunderstood or if they have to do something to affect a change in the way the water left the berm.\"\nHowever, the end result was that homes were spared, he said.\nCBRM spokesperson Christina Lamey says the earthen berms did their job, throttling water to slow down the effects of any potential flooding downstream.\n \n(Tom Ayers/CBC)\n\"There was no flooding down below and everybody that's involved in the trails is ecstatic about that \u2014\u00a0and in the community, I'm sure,\" Gabriel said.\n\"That's what we wanted to happen.\"\nCBRM spokesperson Christina Lamey said municipal engineers checked on the flood controls on Monday after the heavy rain.\n\"The berms worked to an extent in this most recent storm event, in that they held water and essentially they throttled water at the bottom,\" she said.\nParts of the Baille Ard Trail system are still closed due to construction of the earthen berms, while work on lake outlet controls is still being finished.\n \n(Tom Ayers/CBC)\n\"The report back from this morning was that the berms were holding water and they're literally still releasing water now. Here we are, 24 [to] 48 hours after a lot of the rain [and] they're still more slowly releasing that water into the water system below.\"\nThe Mud Lake flood control outlet is done and the municipality still has some work to do on the Gilholmes Lake outlet, but that should be finished in the next few weeks, Lamey said.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nBody of 52-year-old man, unidentified human remains, recovered after devastating N.S. floods\nNova Scotians seek answers on what flooding damage is covered by their insurance\nN.S. sees string of oceanside beach closures amid rainy start to summer\nVideo\nFlooding in N.S. traps rescuers who find themselves needing to be rescued\nMandatory evacuation order issued for campground near Mahone Bay due to flooding",

That was not something horses and wagons could match at the time.\nHistorian James Upham at the site of the decaying remains of the SS Majestic.\n \n(Khalil Akhtar/CBC)\nWhile travel time was relatively quick on the steamship, a May 1946\u00a0Evening Times Globe interview with the Majestic's final captain, M.C. McMurtry, illustrates how pastoral the line once\u00a0was.\n\"We were never in a hurry, and many times went back for folks who arrived late,\" said McMurtry.\n\"We even went back for the occasional hat which had blown overboard. We just considered that common courtesy, and usually recovered the hat before it got too wet.\"\nThe race for customers\nThe Majestic is one of a multitude of steamboats that called the St. John River home.\nThere were several companies that offered steam service on the river in the near century and a half that steamships roamed the river.\u00a0\nA 1932 advertisement showing all of the ships one company operated on the river, including the SS Majestic.\n \n(Evening Times Globe)\nIn addition to the Star Line Steamship Company, which operated the SS Majestic, there was the International Steamship Company, Union Line Bay and River Steamers, among others.\nThose companies piloted ships with names that are still recognized in New Brunswick,\u00a0like the SS DJ Purdy and the SS May Queen.\nMcMurtry said competition was strong.\nThe SS David Weston, one of many steamships that called the St. John River home.\n \n(Provincial Archives of New Brunswick/P210\\430)\n\"In those days, competition was keen with the land carriers and we were out for all the passengers and freight we could get,\" McMurtry said.\nThe rivalry between the companies was good for passengers since the ships put a lot of effort into wooing people away from the competition with luxurious interiors and haute cuisine.\n\"There was a saying at the time that it was cheaper to travel than to stay home, because they were competing to have cheap, excellent food,\" Upham said.\nEnd of an era for 'the lake people'\nIn the end, the rise of rail signalled the end of steamboat travel in the province.\nThe SS Majestic was the last of its\u00a0kind. It decommissioned in 1942.\nInformation Morning - Saint John\n10:10\nRoadside History - SS Majestic\nJames Upham is back to tell us about the century-long tradition of steamboats on the Saint John River, and he takes Khalil Akhtar to see the wreck of the last steamer that worked the river.\nDuring the later years of its service, it would run an alternating route from Saint John to Chipman and Coles Island and became beloved by what one writer to the Evening Times Globe called \"the lake people.\"\n\"The Majestic was a part of the lake people,\" Harry Todd of Codys\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a letter to the editor.\u00a0\n\"We could rely on her to be there as faithfully as the seasons. The fondest memories of my boyhood days are those trips to Saint John on the Majestic.\"\nThe summer schedule for the SS Majestic during her last year of operation.\n \n(Evening Times Globe)\nThe ship was towed one last time up the St. John River to Nauwigewauk in May 1946.\nIt wasn't supposed to be the end of the line for the ship, though, as there were plans to turn the SS Majestic into a dance hall that would remain moored in harbour.\nUnfortunately, the ship was the victim of a hurricane which snapped the ropes keeping it\u00a0docked. The ship later ran\u00a0aground on the shores of Darlings Lake.\n\"This is just one tiny little corner of this amazing system and this is just one of the boats that took part in more than a century of really quite amazing stuff around here,\" said Upham.\nThe SS Majestic when she ran aground on the shores of Darling's Lake.\n \n(Submitted by Pam Beyea)",

By the time the 10th\u00a0or 11th\u00a0bird came through, she said a man came in and told her he was looking outside and noticed chimney swifts.\nHe was\u00a0part of\u00a0SwiftWatch, a program by Birds Canada, and from there\u00a0Theriault said the gallery started working with the group\u00a0to find out what to do about the swifts coming in through the chimney.\nHabitat history\nChimney swifts are unique when it comes to habitat says Graham Sorenson, the Atlantic aerial insectivore conservation program co-ordinator for Birds Canada.\n\"Historically, in North America, chimney swifts would have been breeding in large hollow trees,\" said Sorenson.\nGraham Sorenson of Birds Canada recommends avoiding cleaning or using your chimney from May to August to avoid disturbing chimney swifts. \n \n(Submitted by Graham Sorenson)\n\"As early settlers arrived and began clearing a lot of older forests that would have had these mature trees, and also at the same time [started] building towns with brick chimneys, chimney swifts lost their natural habitat and, pretty readily it seems, adapted to using chimneys.\"\nNow, chimneys are their primary nesting spot, he said.\nChimney swifts are built differently than most bird species, he said, because they're unable to perch on branches and can only cling to vertical surfaces.\nThe birds will collect one twig at a time in early June and fly it into a chimney, where they\u00a0will use\u00a0saliva to glue the twig to the wall, said Sorenson. They repeat this process until they have a small nest attached to the wall to lay their eggs in for summer.\nLeave them be\nSorenson said it's actually not common for chimney swifts to venture inside buildings. But occasionally, if there are\u00a0openings, especially in older chimneys, they might find a way out that looks like the way they came in.\nIf chimney swifts are nesting in your chimney, Sorenson said, it's best to leave them be.\n\"If you find swifts, first off, I think that's really awesome and you should be excited about it. They're really easy, quiet guests, as we like to say, and they provide a service of eating insects around your house.\"\nChimney swifts are a protected species and are considered threatened under the Federal Species at Risk Act in Canada, he said.\nChimney swifts are built differently than most bird species, Sorenson said, because they\u2019re unable to perch on branches and can only cling to vertical surfaces. \n \n(Allison Manthorne/Submitted by Graham Sorenson)\nSorenson recommends avoiding cleaning or using your chimney from May to August to avoid disturbing the birds or potentially smoking them out.\nTheriault said when the birds first started coming into the gallery through the chimney, they considered\u00a0capping it.\nBut the gallery's chimney is unique. It is still old brick, unlike some modern chimneys that have a metal liner on the inside that make\u00a0it too difficult for swifts to grip.\nSorenson said that's one of the challenges with conserving the species. Fewer buildings are being built with brick chimneys and the new ones either have metal liners or caps built on them right away.\u00a0\nConservation group calls for volunteers to track, observe threatened chimney swift\nSee a swoop of swifts? Here's why a group of birders is trying to count them all\n\"This kind of habitat loss of chimneys is a challenge for chimney swifts and will be more of a challenge as the buildings that have these older chimneys continue to age,\" said Sorenson.\nNow, after working with Birds Canada and learning what the birds\u00a0have\u00a0been using the chimney for, Theriault said the gallery has abandoned the idea of capping it.\nShe said they now love the idea of having the chimney swifts nesting in the gallery.\n\"[We would] love to work with them to make sure that they come back every year as a habitat.\"",

So if our treatment plant might not be able to handle cyanobacteria and their toxins in the future, we need to be sure that we invest and ensure that the water is always potable.\"\nDuring the pandemic, the city spent $6 million to reduce the risk of a bloom clogging the water treatment plant southwest of Riverview.\nMoncton's water treatment plant was upgraded in recent years to address the risk of cyanobacteria clogging the works.\n \n(Shane Magee/CBC)\nThe second phase, which is ongoing, involves\u00a0research and testing how to deal with potential toxins.\u00a0\nThe research portion is expected to be complete by either the end of this\u00a0year or early 2024.\n\"It's almost done,\" Taylor said. \"That will determine what type of treatment technology we might need to address cyanotoxins.\"\nMoncton's Turtle Creek reservoir is one of two that supplies the city's drinking water.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC)\nThat's part of where Gagnon's research comes into play.\u00a0Gagnon and Taylor said\u00a0what works in one watershed or treatment plant may not in Moncton, so various options are being tested.\nThe city already has $22 million in funding, some provincial and some federal, to pay for the research and any further upgrades to the plant once there's a decision on the next step.\nTaylor said construction should be complete by 2026.\nMoncton's water treatment plant filtration system. \n \n(Shane Magee/CBC)\nIf a bloom results in toxins in the water, the city would order people not to consume it. Boiling would not remove the toxins.\n\"Obviously we don't want to be in that situation,\" Taylor said.\u00a0\n\"We want to make sure that upstream we do what we can to prevent it from happening if we can, and that if it does happen, then we can treat it at the treatment plant.\"",

        "content": "With no land predators trying to snatch away eggs for an easy dinner, and \na scientific\u00a0station run\n by Bowdoin University in Maine for nearly 90 years, Kent Island has become the home of some of the longest-continuing species studies in the world.\u00a0\nThe only mammals on the island, a tiny spot in the Bay of Fundy off the southeast coast of Grand Manan, are muskrats and scientists. That has allowed it\u00a0to become a haven for nesting birds and the people who study them.\u00a0\nEvery day, Patrica Jones ventures out into a small, forested area of Kent Island known as the shire.\u00a0Under the ground\u00a0are\u00a0hundreds of tiny burrows. Some have little sticks lined up blocking their entrance. Some do not. All of them have a little metal medallion with a number hanging outside.\n\"Birds don't mind knocking over some sticks to go in,\" said Jones.\nThe burrow of a Leach's storm petrel is lined with a few twigs so researchers can tell if it's being used by a nesting pair.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\nShe checks her paper map and finds a burrow where there are no twigs blocking the entrance. That means something's inside. Lying on the forest floor, she pushes her hand into the burrow all the way up to her shoulder. When she pulls it out, she's cupping a small grey bird with a black beak:\u00a0a Leach's storm petrel.\nThe seabird has travelled to Kent Island from the southern coast of Africa to lay a single egg underground. Jones\u00a0measures its wings and\u00a0feet and\u00a0weighs it, noting\u00a0the number on a band on its leg. She also takes measurements of the small egg she also pulled\u00a0from the burrow. Everything she records is handwritten.\u00a0\nPatricia Jones holds a Leach's storm petrel. The small birds come all the way from the southern coast of Africa to lay a single egg underground every year.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\nThe process takes several minutes,\u00a0all part of a study that has been running since 1953, with a bit more data dating back to the 1930s.\u00a0\n\"We've got this really amazing \u2014 one of the longest data sets on a vertebrate animal in the world,\" said Jones, who is the director of the Bowdoin Scientific Station on Kent Island.\nWATCH | See how scientists are studying the birds they live with on a remote N.B. island:\nThe secret lives of birds on Kent Island\n2 days ago\nDuration \n5:56\nFor nearly 9 decades researchers have come to live in isolation on an island to study petrels, gulls and other birds.\nBecause the storm petrel study on this island has been going on for 70 years, Jones and her predecessors have been able to track the health of the small seabird population, made up of about\u00a020,000 mated pairs.\u00a0\n\"We can track impacts on climate on egg-lay date and egg-hatch date\u00a0and egg-hatch success,\" said Jones. \"There are a lot of variables that we've been tracking for a long time here with this population.\"\nThat includes where the birds go.\nGPS trackers show parents take turns caring for their single egg. One will stay with the egg while the other travels to Cape Cod, Mass., about 400 kilometres away, to feed for a few days.\u00a0 \nPatricia Jones, the director of the Bowdoin Scientific Station on Kent Island, weighs a Leach's storm petrel. \n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\n\"Then come back here to this tiny island to their little burrow in the ground and sit on their eggs for another three days,\" said Jones.\u00a0\nThe birds have a long life,\u00a0with Kent Island records showing they live to be at least 36 years old. Jones says they know the petrel population is in decline, not unlike most seabird species.\u00a0\nIntrepid scientists live on this isolated N.B. island, with thousands of birds for neighbours\n9 days ago\nDuration \n4:41\nKent Island is a bird sanctuary in the Bay of Fundy, where every year researchers come to study \u2014 and live amongst \u2014 different species.\nLeaving the shire and crossing the basin on Kent Island leads to the grasslands. Savannah sparrows dart through the grasses where they've laid their eggs. Research on these small songbirds has been ongoing for the last 36 years.\u00a0\n\"This study has been running since 1987,\" said Sarah Mueller, a PhD candidate at the University of Guelph. \"They've done a lot of different things\u00a0\u2014\u00a0migration studies, different studies of breeding biology and success and that kind of thing.\"\nPatricia Jones holds up a petrel that she's just measured and weighed.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\nMueller goes from nest to nest, noting how many eggs are in each. When\u00a0they hatch, she scoops them up to take measurements, weigh them\u00a0and\u00a0take a blood sample before carefully returning them to the nest.\nShe's been working on the study for the last two years as just one of a series of researchers contributing to the long-term data on the population.\u00a0\n\"Some of the things they've been able to do with that really long-term data is look at drivers of population growth and decline,\" said Mueller.\u00a0 \nSarah Mueller, a PhD candidate at the University of Guelph, holds a Savannah sparrow hatchling on Kent Island. \n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\nShe says researchers learned that competition for territory and resources, as well as winter survival,\u00a0seem to have large impact on the population, which, like the petrel,\u00a0is also on the decline.\nMueller's currently studying\u00a0the most common causes of death for the young swallows, as well as how far they typically venture from their nests.\u00a0\n\"I've found that about 33 per cent of fledglings make it to about three months,\" said Mueller. \"Which seems pretty low, only 33 per cent of fledglings survive ... but fairly comparable to other songbird studies.\"\u00a0\nHow one lost bird led to the creation of a research station in the Bay of Fundy\n16 days ago\nDuration \n4:21\nA century ago, a lighthouse keeper sparked a series of events that would lead to the creation of the Kent Island Scientific Station.\nOn a beach near the sparrows, two more researchers plant herring gull decoys\u00a0near nests.\u00a0\n\"Only the fun part of my work takes place here out in the field,\" jokes Liam Taylor, an evolutionary biologist working\u00a0on\u00a0his PhD at Yale. \"We're interested in a different kind of question:\u00a0what does breeding in a colony do to a bird? And how does it maybe reshape their evolution?\"\nYale graduate student Liam Taylor points out unique gull behavior on Kent Island. He's been studying their interactions within the breeding colony as part of his work as an evolutionary biologist.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\nTaylor says they've found young gulls will return to the Kent Island breeding colony years before they're actually able to breed, and scientists don't yet know why. So they're recording how parent gulls react to having younger gulls,\u00a0that don't seem to have an obvious role in the colony, near their young.\u00a0\nThey place decoys with various\u00a0feather patterns that indicate the gull's\u00a0age near a nest and record the reactions.\u00a0\n\"We give it two minutes\u00a0and it can be from anything from just, like, they fly away, sometimes they circle. Sometimes they peck at the decoy\u00a0or, like, kick it,\" said Lily Fanburg, a psychology major at Bowdoin University.\nShe has to dodge incoming gulls that will sometimes try to bomb her with poop\u00a0as she retrieves the decoys and the wireless\u00a0speaker that plays gull calls after each trial.\nLily Fanburg has been working on researching herring gull behavior on Kent Island by placing decoys near nests and recording the reactions from parents.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\n\"It's very different from my previous summer research experiences,\" said Fanburg.\u00a0\nResearchers here will stay throughout the summer, with the last ones leaving in October. But they'll return in April, just as they have since 1936.\u00a0",

Cassandra LeBlanc says constituents have long asked for something to be done about the 'eyesore' that is the former gas station on Woodstock Road.\n \n(Aidan Cox/CBC)\n\"Remediation is going to need to be done because it had previously, you know, served as a gas station and also because of its location just down on the [St. John] River,\" Rogers said.\n\"So it's very important that that remediation work be done, and that's costly work.\"\nA 'creative solution' led to agreement\nThe agreement for the city to purchase the property required negotiations between the city, the former owner and the New Brunswick\u00a0government, said Ryan Seymour, the city's manager of real estate.\n\"It's a complex site and it required a creative solution,\" Seymour said.\nFredericton city real estate manager Ryan Seymour says the city plans to put the property back up for sale once the environmental remediation is done.\n \n(Aidan Cox/CBC)\nThe city is only spending $1 on the property.\u00a0However, the remediation work could cost about $100,000, said Sean Lee, the city's assistant director of engineering and operations.\nSeymour declined to say how much money the property was in arrears for, but said the city will not be on the hook for that money.\nHe said once the site is cleaned up, the city will likely put it up for sale.\n\"So that's the end game, but there's a lot of work that has to be done before we can get to that point.\"\nRemediation could start as early as this fall\nWith the city now\u00a0the property owner, the first step will be to demolish the building\u00a0that stands there, Lee said.\nOnce that is done, the ground will need to be excavated to uncover and remove\u00a0any fuels that have been left behind.\nThe work to remediate the site could cost about $100,000, however a defined price tag is unknown for now, said Sean Lee, assistant director of engineering and operations for the City of Fredericton.\n \n(Aidan Cox/CBC)\n\"It was a former gas station, so as such there is some contamination on the property, which is fuels, heavy fuels and oils,\"\u00a0Lee said.\nLee said the exact costs of remediation are unknown, as more information about the scale of the work will only be learned once crews start digging into the ground.\n\"This could be a one-week, two week job, we don't know yet, and one of the first things we need to line up is the removal of the building itself... then we can move forward to the next steps.\"\nLee said that work will either begin this fall or next spring.",

But he soon noticed something different on the water.\u00a0\n\"Suddenly, I saw this commotion out in the water.\"\nMichael said the commotion was approximately a quarter of a mile offshore and described it as water that \"consolidated into two or three funnels swirling in a circle.\"\nGustnado? Tornadic waterspout? Whatever it is, this phenomenon was caught on video\n1 day ago\nDuration \n0:45\nAn uncommon weather event unfolded off Youghall Beach in Bathurst, as Paul and Jane Michael enjoyed an evening on the deck. But what is it?\nHe said the weather event swirled and moved \"fairly quickly\" across Chaleur Bay and lasted \"about 60 seconds or so.\"\nMichael, who recorded the event on his phone, said it was like watching \"water that sort of moved up into the air, like funnels.\"\u00a0\n\"We were all amazed. It was just mesmerizing really, to watch it.\"\nCBC meteorologist\u00a0Ryan Snoddon\u00a0said what Michael captured on his phone is a \"rare\" event but it will take experts some time to determine what it was.\nThis is a radar image of a thunderstorm over the Bathurst area on Saturday night. \n \n(Submitted by Ryan Snoddon)\nSnoddon said satellite radar images confirmed a large thunderstorm moved through the Bathurst region at the time.\u00a0\n\"So, that leaves us with two options,\"\u00a0he said.\u00a0\nSnoddon said it was either a tornadic waterspout or a gustnado.\nTornadic waterspout or gustnado?\nA tornadic waterspout is \"essentially a tornado that forms over the water or moves from land to the water,\"\u00a0he said.\nTornadic waterspouts have the \"same characteristics as a land tornado\" and are associated with severe thunderstorms.\u00a0\n\"A waterspout is a spinning column of air that extends down from the clouds and touches the water surface, forming that waterspout\", he said.\nA gustnado is a combination of a \"gust front and a tornado but it is not a tornado,\"\u00a0he said.\u00a0\nSnoddon said, unlike a tornado, a gustnado is not actually connected to the base of the cloud.\n\"It's essentially a column of rotating air; a mesocyclonic rotation that's kind of spinning ahead of the actual thunderstorm.\"\nN.B. averages 1 or 2 tornadoes a year\nSnoddon contacted the Northern Tornadoes Project (NTP)\u00a0 at Western University in London, Ontario to determine what happened on Chaleur Bay.\u00a0\nAccording to the NTP's website, the centre aims to \"better detect tornado occurrence throughout Canada\" and improve severe weather predicting and mitigating damage from extreme weather events.\u00a0\nSnoddon said the experts at the centre have access to higher-resolution radar imagery and\u00a0velocity imagery from the thunderstorm near Bathurst.\nNTP experts are investigating what happened on Chaleur Bay Saturday night and will record it in their database.\u00a0\nWhether it was a tornadic waterspout or a gustnado, Snoddon said both are \"quite rare.\"\nHe said if this was a tornadic waterspout, it could be categorized as a tornado. New Brunswick averages one or two\u00a0tornadoes annually.\u00a0 \nDenis Foulem said it was \"very fortunate\" this meteorological event was captured on video when it happened.\u00a0\nFoulem, who worked as a meteorological technician for Environment Canada, said it might be \"years\" before residents see another event like this.\nDenis Foulem, a retired meteorological technician for Environment Canada, says he\u2019s 'lucky' to have seen four similar events on the Chaleur Bay over the past six decades. \n \n(Submitted by Denis Foulem)\nThe retired Nigadoo, N.B. resident said he's \"lucky\" to have seen four similar events on the Chaleur Bay over the past six decades.\u00a0\nSuch events \"don't last very long,\"\u00a0he said. \"Less than a minute, usually.\"\nPaul Michael said Saturday's event was the first he had seen.\u00a0\nOnce it dissipated, Michael said the water on Chaleur Bay \"seemed normal\" with a few ripples but \"no great waves or anything.\"\n\"This seemed to just appear out of nowhere and disappeared,\"\u00a0he said. \"It just started and stopped.\"",

But there is spinoff with that, and we're going to lose out on that.\"\nBruce McCormack shared how downtown businesses were impacted by the past two floods. \n \n(Jonathan Collicott/CBC)\nService New Brunswick, which announced the move to Brookside Mall last week, did not agree to an interview with CBC News on Monday.\nIn an email, spokesperson Jennifer Vienneau said the minister, Mary Wilson, would be available for an interview closer to the move, which is nearly a year away, according to a news release.\u00a0\nMcCormack said the Service New Brunswick minister did come to his office originally to let his\u00a0group\u00a0know the Progressive Conservative government was considering moving the office to the other side of the river.\nWATCH | \nFredericton residents react to planned Service New Brunswick move:\u00a0\nFredericton residents divided as Service New Brunswick plans move to northside\n1 day ago\nDuration \n1:17\nThe Fredericton Service New Brunswick location will be moving to the Brookside Mall from downtown Fredericton next summer \u2014 and some residents have thoughts.\nHe said he was told that the lease was up in October 2024 and the province wasn't\u00a0going to renew.\nMcCormack said Service New Brunswick put out a request for proposals to find another location in downtown Fredericton.\u00a0 \n\"We put forth five different locations in front of them,\" he said. \"And they came back and said none of them were suitable.\"\nThe release confirmed that in March, a request for space was made in the city's downtown core but \"no adequate locations were identified.\" The province says that as a result, the Brookside Mall was chosen, since it meets all of their requirements \"including access to city transit and adequate parking.\"\nOn Queen Street on Monday, Raj Mulakala, a master's student at the University of New Brunswick, said that part of Fredericton is pretty accessible to everyone.\u00a0\nFrom a student's perspective, he thinks it would be more difficult to access services at the Brookside Mall.\n\"There won't be [many] buses because [the] number of buses to downtown are more, but to Brookside Mall, it will be less.\"\nThe Brookside Mall on Fredericton's north side is the chosen location for Fredericton's Service New Brunswick centre.\n \n(Pat Richard/CBC)\nDavid Coon, MLA for Fredericton South, which is home to the current location, is also not pleased with the accessibility of the new choice.\n\"I was appalled that the government would take Service New Brunswick out of a very central, easy-to-access location in downtown Fredericton, where lots of people who don't have vehicles can easily access it,\" said Coon.\n\"I see lots of people who don't have vehicles on this side because of the large population here living in poverty, including our homeless population. And yet, their intent is to move it across the river. It doesn't make any sense to me.\"\nHe said bus service isn't the best in the city, especially going from the south side to the north side.\nHe believes the move comes down to shaving rental costs.\nCoon said moves like this have been a trend, and he thinks it will continue, with more services moving to less accessible locations.\nRaj Mulakala, a master\u2019s student in business at the University of New Brunswick, said downtown Fredericton is pretty accessible to everyone. \n \n(Pat Richard/CBC)\nHe wishes that the government had been more open with\u00a0Frederictonians about the plan and given them a chance to weigh in before the announcement was made.\n\"Because ultimately, their responsibility is to make sure people are well-served, and people should have an opportunity to weigh in on whether they feel like this is going to diminish their services or not,\" said Coon.\nSteve Forrester, a Fredericton resident who lives on the south side, said he thinks the majority of the population likely lives closer to the current location, but he likes the Brookside Mall as a space.\nMost of the things he needs are on the south side, he said, but he doesn't see the new location as being too much farther away.\nDavid Coon, MLA for Fredericton South, home to the current location of Fredericton's Service New Brunswick, said he wishes residents were given a chance to weigh in on the move before the announcement was made.\n \n(Jacques Poitras/CBC)\n\"I think it's a nice part of town that could use a little bit of reviving too, so probably not the worst thing for that area,\" said Forrester. \"And it's not that far. I mean, we don't live in Toronto. It's not like commuting is that far away.\"\nEric Claybourne, a resident of the north side, said he's not too happy about the move. He said even though he lives on the north side, the Brookside Mall is still far away from him.\nSteve Forrester, a Fredericton resident who lives on the south side, said most things he needs are on the south side, he doesn\u2019t see the Brookside Mall as being too much farther a commute.\n \n(Pat Richard/CBC)\nClaybourne bikes everywhere so he doesn't need to rely on the bus system. But he hopes that Service New Brunswick wait times will be addressed with the new location.\u00a0\n\"I know a lot of people that come here every day and wait for hours and hours and hours,\" said Claybourne. \"I'm hoping if they are moving it, they're making it slightly bigger with a lot more staff, so more people can be helped in a quicker time.\"",

Macdonald position was Tatyana Russell-Chipp, a musician and missionary at Grasseschi's church\u00a0in Quispamsis.\nIn 2019, members of the Canadian Prophetic Council, in the lower photo, tried to recreate an inconic 1864 image of the Fathers of Confederation in front of the lieutenant-governor\u2019s residence in Charlottetown. \n \n(Library and Archives Canada and submitted by Tatyana Russell-Chipp )\nThe new photo was more than a cheeky homage, said Russell-Chipp, and was meant as \"a prophetic act.\"\n\"Like, 'we're going to be who you were, in a new time, in order to be God's hands and feet for Canada, to reestablish the Dominion of Canada as something that honours God,'\" Russell-Chipp said in an interview.\nThe Fathers of Confederation called the new nation the \"Dominion of Canada,\" inspired by Psalm 72:8 \u2014\u00a0\"He shall have dominion from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth.\"\nFor some believers, that choice of words was a sign from God, according to former followers.\n\"It's prophetic to them,\" said Brent Harris, a Saint John city councillor who worked as a minister for churches affiliated with Grasseschi's church in Quispamsis.\n\"Using that word was the Lord coming in to put his fingerprint on the nation, and when the resurrection happens, you know this will be the nation of Canada rising to its proper place in the kingdom,\" Harris said.\u00a0\nTo pave the way for that, adherents believe that \"true believers must be elected,\" said\u00a0Marci McDonald, the author of a 2010 book on the Christian conservative movement.\n'If you love something you get involved,' Grasseschi says\nGrasseschi now leads the Canadian Prophetic Council, which lists \"belief in the supremacy of the Word of God\" as its first core value.\u00a0\nShe also hosts a TV show looking at current affairs from a faith-based perspective.\nHer organization, 4 My Canada, is running a webpage signing up people to support Premier Blaine Higgs on his changes to Policy 713, which sets out protections for LGBTQ+ students in schools.\nSince Faytene Grasseschi publicly defended Premier Blaine Higgs, she has been called out by those who believe her political activism is driven by religious doctrine.\n \n(Jacques Poitras/CBC)\nIf Higgs faces a leadership review in the Progressive Conservative Party, Grasseschi plans to urge those who sign to buy party memberships to vote for him.\n\"What motivated me is that I love Canada,\" she said in an interview with CBC News earlier this month, in which she avoided questions about how her religious views drive her political involvement.\nChristian conservative group recruiting thousands to back Higgs\nNo plans to let parents shift tax dollars out of public schools, Higgs says\n\"If you love something you get involved, and it's really as simple as that. \u2026 The nation and our communities are shaped by those who show up in the process.\"\nHowever, her previous statements and involvement in various religious organizations have caused some to question the motivations behind her campaign \u2014\u00a0and to urge PC party members to be wary.\n'Much more radical' behind the scenes:\u00a0former follower\nSince Grasseschi gave that interview, several former followers have called her out on social media.\nThey believe a religious doctrine called the New Apostolic Reformation is central to her political activism, and to her attempts to influence the PC party's debate about Higgs's future.\n\"They just want to come across as very caring and pleasant and normal, regular people, and they're really good at that,\" said Sarah Ecker, a former adherent of NAR who lives outside Fredericton.\nSarah Ecker, a former follower of the New Apostolic Reformation, says adherents 'want to come across as very caring and pleasant and normal, regular people.' \n \n(Jacques Poitras/CBC)\n\"But then behind the scenes they're much more radical in their beliefs.\"\nAccording to Russell-Chipp, Grasseschi's political activism \"checks all the boxes\" of the NAR, which she said \"aims to make society look more like heaven, so it's more plausible for Jesus to return.\"\nAnd she said that could make society \"a really unsafe place for a lot of marginalized groups, especially queer people, especially trans people.\"\nNAR adherence 'hard to pin down,' expert says\nAdherence to NAR is, however, \"very hard to pin down\"\u00a0 because of the movement's amorphous nature, said\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Gagn\u00e9, a Concordia University professor who has studied the Christian right.\u00a0\nIt lacks a defined congregation, hierarchy or structure.\nC. Peter Wagner, a U.S. missionary who coined the term New Apostolic Reformation, wrote in 2011 that it is \"not an organization. No one can join or carry a card. It has no leader.\"\nEcker\u00a0said some adherents \"aren't even aware of these terms, but they hold these ideas deeply. \u2026\u00a0So it's really easy to say, 'Oh, I'm not part of that.'\"\nGagn\u00e9 points to Grasseschi's 2005 book, Stand on Guard, where she called for Canadians to reestablish \"the righteous foundations laid by generations past\" and stand up for \"the dominion of Jesus Christ manifested in every arena of the nation.\"\nA close look at the web of networks and associations among Christian conservatives shows connections between Grasseschi and figures \"associated\" with NAR, said Gagn\u00e9.\u00a0\nHe said they include Cindy Jacobs, a U.S. faith leader close to Wagner who co-founded Generals International, whose website espouses \"spiritual warfare,\" and Stacey Campbell, who founded the Canadian Prophetic Council that Grasseschi now runs.\nBut Grasseschi\u00a0said she has \"no memory\" of Jacobs or Campbell using the term NAR.\nCriticism based on firsthand experience, former adherents say\nGagn\u00e9\u00a0said NAR adherents espouse a concept called Dominionism that holds that \"Christians are called by God to rule, to have authority and penetrate and have influence on the social and political institutions of their country and the world.\"\nThe three former followers all believe Grasseschi subscribes to that view.\nThey say that's based on their own first-hand experience, though Grasseschi disputes that.\n\"The people who left the church did not know me beyond a surface acquaintance, and we never had conversations about these things together,\" she said.\nRussell-Chipp worshipped alongside Grasseschi at her church in Quispamsis, Harris was part of the same\u00a0movement, and Ecker considers herself a former adherent of the New Apostolic Reformation.\nTatyana Russell-Chipp was a musician and missionary at Grasseschi\u2019s church in Quispamsis. \n \n(Submitted by Tatyana Russell-Chipp)\nRussell-Chipp joined the church\u00a0in Quispamsis in 2017 and said\u00a0the church became more politically active in 2020 when Grasseschi arrived.\n\"She was extremely driven and knew that this was a place that she could get support from people who thought like her,\" said Russell-Chipp.\nChurch members volunteered for her unsuccessful campaign to win the federal Conservative nomination for Saint John-Rothesay for the 2021 election, she said.\nThey did so \"on their own time and of their own volition,\" Grasseschi responded, and with no financial support from the church.\u00a0\nNAR's goal: 'kingdom-minded people'\u00a0in 7 key areas\nWagner, the American religious leader who first defined NAR, said in 2011 its goal was \"to have kingdom-minded people\" in seven key areas of society: religion, family, education, government, media, the arts and business.\nThose leaders, he said, would help \"the blessings and prosperity of the Kingdom of God \u2026 permeate all areas of society\" and \"push back the long-standing kingdom of Satan and bring the peace and prosperity of His kingdom here on earth.\n\"This is what we mean by Dominionism,\" Wagner wrote.\nGrasseschi\u00a0said she is not a Dominionist and the NAR label \"is not one I am deeply acquainted with. My sense is that it has been used in a derogatory way to try to label people of faith to try to discount them in the public square.\"\nReligion not relevant to Policy 713 debate, Grasseschi says\nIn her July 12 CBC interview, Grasseschi said her religious views were not relevant to her political involvement and didn't want to discuss them in detail.\n\"Do I believe in the power of prayer? Absolutely,\" she said. \"I think most Canadians do.\"\nBut she said many New Brunswickers of other faiths, or of no faith, were signing her petition supporting Higgs on Policy 713.\nShe said she was motivated as a mother, believing parents should not be excluded from discussions at school about their children wanting to change their names and pronouns to reflect their gender identity.\nGagn\u00e9\u00a0said it's common for NAR followers to frame their efforts \"in a way that doesn't sound religious\" to gain allies and advance their agenda.\nActivist said she's not hiding her faith\nAsked about the criticism by Ecker, Russell-Chipp and Harris, Grasseschi wrote in a July 22 email that \"I am not hiding (or ashamed) that I am a person of faith, this is public knowledge, and I have revealed it plainly for years.\n\"It just isn't relevant to [Don't Delete Parents] and our support of the premier on 713. This is about parents.\"\nShe pointed out that Psalm 72, where the \"dominion\" phrase appears, \"is about protecting the needy, the afflicted who are abandoned, and defending the weak from violence.\"\nGrasseschi says she met with Higgs in March in his role as Quispamsis MLA, before the Policy 713 controversy began.\n \n(Submitted by Faytene Grasseschi)\nShe said that's why she supported federal legislation to fight human trafficking, helped Ukrainians fleeing the war, worked to create community gardens to help people facing food insecurity, and backed a Conservative MP's 2010 bill to ban what it calls \"coerced\" abortions.\nGrasseschi has also been a missionary in Africa and a volunteer helping homeless people in Vancouver.\u00a0\n\"I believe in Christ-like service, loving our neighbour as ourselves and crossing the road to help,\" she said.\n\"The leadership of Christ is always about serving and laying your life down for others, particularly the most vulnerable. That is His style. It is never about control.\"\nSome figures 'rebranding' NAR because of divisions\nGagn\u00e9\u00a0said divisions over NAR among U.S. evangelicals, prompted in part by mistaken prophecies that Donald Trump would remain in power and by the Jan. 6 insurrection, have led some figures to distance themselves from the term.\n\"They're just changing names, relabelling, rebranding, but in the end it still remains, pretty much at the core, a lot of the same ideas,\" he said.\n\"I'm not convinced that Faytene doesn't know what this is. I think she knows what this is. \u2026 I'm not saying people don't change through time, but it's clear in her 2005 book, she did talk about dominion.\"\nHave Grasseschi's views changed?\u00a0\nGrasseschi\u00a0said her ideas have evolved over the years.\u00a0\n\"There are things I said years ago that I would not say today or not in the same way. This could be said of any public person,\" she said.\n\"As we go, we mature and deepen in understanding. Our communities are also in a different place, and the conversations are different.\"\nRussell-Chipp is skeptical based on what she saw when she attended Grasseschi's church.\n\"She's still advocating for the same things. She still maintains the same world view,\" she said.\n\"I can't imagine that much has changed for her.\"\nAnd that vision \"is not a safe world view for queer people, for trans people,\" she added.\nIn her email responses, Grasseschi compared anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment to how she said she has been \"bullied in a sustained way\" for her views.\u00a0\n\"I respect the rights of adults to identify and live as they wish. \u2026 I would never do anything to create an unsafe culture for others, no matter who they are.\"\nPCs should 'do some soul-searching'\nAll three of Grasseschi's critics have now left the movement.\nEcker\u00a0said she still has church-going friends \"and they're wonderful people. I just don't want to be in those spaces right now. I find so much joy in quietness and reflecting.\"\nBut she has been vocal on social media about Grasseschi and is urging New Brunswick's PC party to \"do their homework, figure out who people are, who they really are\" or risk further radicalizing and dividing provincial politics.\nIn a mid-July statement about Grasseschi's campaign, Higgs said he has received support \"from a wide cross section of individuals\" who come from \"different backgrounds, different cultures, and different religions.\"\nHe said \"despite their differences,\" they share his belief and supports his what he calls his balanced approach on Policy 713.\nEcker says Tory members \"need to do some soul searching and reflecting on who they want to attach their cart to.\"\n\"Are they using that movement or is that movement using them?\"",

It took place in a construction zone, where traffic was down to one lane in both directions, only separated by pylons.\n \n(Mariam Mesbah/CBC)\nAmbulances and fire trucks from several departments had been dispatched to the scene, Lauzon said.\nHe did not have details about how the crash happened or which way the various vehicles were travelling.

Traffic\u00a0could not be rerouted onto the other side of the highway because of the construction going on.\nInstead, traffic in both directions is being\u00a0diverted\u00a0overnight Tuesday into Wednesday onto Route 105 between exit 339 at Jemseg and exit 347 at Mill Cove.\nLauzon said police would have no further information until Wednesday.",

Now I can't do that.\"\nNo grandchildren, and no more birthday and holiday celebrations, she said.\nShe was reading her victim impact statement during the sentencing hearing for Sean Patrick Patterson, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder of Leard in his Upper Cape home on May 25, 2021.\nThe 30-year-old Patterson and a co-accused, Henry Alexander Joseph Pottie, were scheduled to stand trial on a charge of first-degree murder earlier this year.\nTwo admit role in killing\nDays before the trial began, Patterson pleaded guilty\n\u00a0to the lesser charge.\u00a0\nPottie pleaded guilty to manslaughter\n\u00a0after the jury trial had started and will be sentenced Sept. 15.\nOn Tuesday, Crown prosecutor Maurice Blanchard outlined the facts Patterson was admitting to Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Tracey DeWare.\u00a0He said Patterson was among five people at Leard's home on\u00a0May 25, 2021.\nLeard left to drive\u00a0Amanda Noiles and her young son back to Springhill, N.S., but turned around after getting a phone notification that his\u00a0surveillance system had been turned off.\u00a0Blanchard said Patterson\u00a0shut off the power \"to prevent the cameras from capturing the upcoming events.\"\nPolice outside Leard's home on Upper Cape Road in 2021.\n \n(Shane Magee/CBC)\nHe said Patterson told police he believed there were other cameras hidden in the house because Leard thought Patterson was stealing from him.\u00a0Patterson\u00a0had concocted a plan to confront Leard about it with a gun he would shoot near his head.\nLeard walked back into the house, said \"What the f--k are you guys doing,\" and was shot in the head.\u00a0Patterson and Pottie cleaned the scene and\u00a0hid Leard's body. Later, his remains were burned.\nBlanchard said there were no hidden cameras found by police. He said\u00a0the actual motive\u00a0for the 38-year-old's murder was unclear.\n\"It's a bit hard to fathom why this happened,\" Blanchard said,\u00a0adding the driving force appeared to be drug addiction.\u00a0\nIt's a statement Patterson's lawyers echoed.\u00a0\nLeard's mother reported him missing May 28, 2021.\u00a0Those present when he was shot initially\u00a0lied or misled police about what happened, Blanchard said.\u00a0Leard's\u00a0remains were found in early June and Patterson and Pottie were charged.\nA photo taken by RCMP entered as an exhibit shows the area behind an abandoned trailer that Jamie Leard's remains were found in 2021.\n \n(Shane Magee/CBC)\nThe prosecutor told the judge that there are differences in their\u00a0accounts of what happened, even after their guilty pleas.\nPatterson said Pottie had also shot Leard in\u00a0the arm and abdomen, but\u00a0Pottie says he didn't shoot Leard.\nAn autopsy found Leard died of two gunshot wounds to his head.\n\"This was not consistent \u2014 the two gunshot wounds to the head \u2014 with any other statement we had on file,\" Blanchard said.\nSecond-degree murder, a homicide that's generally unplanned, carries an automatic sentence of life in prison with a minimum of 10 years before becoming eligible to apply for parole.\u00a0\nThat leaves DeWare's decision about when to set Patterson's eligibility.\u00a0\nThe Crown and defence jointly recommended 14 years based on the circumstances of Patterson's case and\u00a0similar cases.\nHowever, the Crown and defence say that time should be reduced by 39 months as credit for\u00a0time he's spent in custody prior to sentencing.\nDefence lawyer Daniel Gallant said that would mean he could seek parole in his early 40s.\u00a0While someone can apply for parole once eligible, it may not be granted by the Parole Board of Canada.\nMurder trial in Moncton ends with guilty plea to manslaughter\nDays before murder trial, man pleads guilty to killing Jamie Leard\nGallant said Patterson is remorseful and has shame for the pain caused to the community, his family, and Leard's family.\u00a0Gallant said Patterson started using crack cocaine at 18 and later started using crystal meth.\u00a0\nPatterson stood and turned toward Leard's family in the courtroom gallery, apologizing for his actions.\u00a0\n\"I'm really sorry Doris, it wasn't supposed to happen,\" Patterson said.\nDeWare\u00a0said she needed more time to prepare her decision on parole eligibility.

        "summary": "Construction of a new donation-processing facility by a Fredericton food bank hopes to address the challenges that come with large and fresh food donations.",
        "content": "A Fredericton food bank wants to make its donations greener and healthier.\nGreener Village, the city's largest food bank, has already started\u00a0fundraising to build a food rescue centre.\n\"Of the food we grow in Canada, about 58 per cent\u00a0of it goes to waste, whether it's plowed back into the fields or ends in a landfill,\" said Alex Boyd, CEO of Greener Village.\nWith a new 6,500-square-foot building, the organization will be able to process large-scale food donations and keep more food from being wasted.\nPreviously, food banks in New Brunswick struggled with large-scale donations from companies like grocery stores.\n\"Large-volume producers need to move larger quantities of food at once. Companies don't have time or resources to make several deliveries to smaller organizations,\" Boyd said.\nHe added that large shipments of food for donation are often shipped out of the Maritimes to Montreal, because that's the nearest location that can process bigger volumes.\n\"So this is really a gap in the network that we're looking to fill,\" Boyd said.\nThe problem\nThere's many reasons why we waste food.\nA truck full of product might be delayed and then discarded, grocery stores might reject a shipment that doesn't meet their standards, and stores might throw away products that don't sell in their expected timeframe.\nSmaller food donations from individuals or groups, like this one, are easier for food banks to handle. Large-scale donations from companies like grocery stores require more space to handle the volume and quicker action to distribute perishable food quickly. \n \n(Provided by Michael Boushy)\n\"The problem is while we're wasting food we also have people in our society who are struggling to make ends meet and struggling to feed their families,\" Boyd said.\nReceiving fresh food has\u00a0added challenges.\n\"It doesn't stack neatly, you can't put it on the shelf and use it two weeks from now. You have to have a constant process to take care of that,\" Boyd said.\nBut he said fresh food is essential to the 1,900 families a month\u00a0his organization helps.\n\"If you're facing food insecurity, you need good food. People who have good food do better at work, they do better at school, and they have better health outcomes overall.\"\nPlans for food rescue centre\nThe new centre will address the need for fresh food and the ability to process larger orders.\nThe building will have three parts. The first is a triage centre, where workers can assess shipments when they come in and decide what food can be distributed to clients immediately.\nThe second part of the facility is the real game-changer\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a full commercial kitchen.\nTake carrots and tomatoes, for example. Normal food pantries would have to hand them out almost immediately before they spoil.\nFresh food is often a challenge for food banks, since produce needs to be distributed to families before it goes bad.\n \n(Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada)\nWith a kitchen, the facility \"would be able to take that product and process it into diced carrots or tomato sauce, into different products that we can either freeze or package in a way that we could then use that product for months,\" Boyd said.\nThe third part of the facility will have large-scale fridges and freezers to preserve the now-processed food.\nBoyd said this new facility would remove a lot of uncertainty from food banks in New Brunswick.\n\"That means not having each independent food bank to worry about 'how am I going to handle this fresh product' and 'how am I going to worry about it getting out to people before it goes bad,'\" Boyd said.\nFinancing the project\nGreener Village has just begun fundraising for the project, which has a goal of $4.3 million.\nBoyd estimates 10 per cent\u00a0of the goal has been raised so far, and plans are in place for a large-scale fundraising drive soon.\u00a0\nThe location will be on Greener Village's existing property on Riverside Drive in Fredericton, and groundbreaking is expected in early 2024.\u00a0\nThe food rescue centre will be built on Greener Village's property on Riverside Drive in Fredericton, saving the organization from real estate costs.\n \n(Catherine Harrop/CBC)\nBoyd said he has received a commitment for a financial contribution from the city, and has been in conversation with the province and federal government for additional funds.\u00a0\n\"It really meets the mandates of all three levels of our government to be more sustainable, to be more environmentally friendly,\" Boyd said.\n\"But also to make sure that the people in our communities who are struggling with food insecurity are having their needs met.\"\nOpinion\nDon't think of food banks as a Band-Aid. What we do is more like a tourniquet\nWhile the new facility will make partnerships between food banks in the region stronger and broaden which foods they can process, at the end of the day, it's about their clients, Boyd said.\n\"For each of those families, it means that they're going to get a higher percentage of fresh and frozen food in their food bank hamper,\" he\u00a0said.",

        "content": "Fredericton has cleared a\u00a0major hurdle blocking the road to Sunday bus service.\nThe city has struck a new collective agreement with its bus drivers, doing away with a provision in their former contract entitling them to double pay if they worked on Sunday.\nDrivers would now earn their regular wage, plus a modest premium, for operating buses on Sundays, making the introduction\u00a0of the service more feasible than before, said Coun. Bruce Grandy, who chairs the city's mobility committee.\n\"That puts us in a very good position to look at Sunday service, and you know, I think this council has made it very clear they want Sunday service.\"\nFredericton stands out as the only one of New Brunswick's three largest cities that doesn't offer transit service on Sundays.\nFor years, users have called on the city to implement it, but the service has gone undelivered, leaving\u00a0many with no\u00a0choice but to take taxis to get to and from work or to run errands.\nContract with Fredericton bus drivers would give them double pay on Sundays\nNew tech will help justify Sunday bus service, city says, but not until at least 2024\nPart of the challenge with implementing Sunday service was a provision in the collective agreement between the city and CUPE, the union representing transit workers, which entitled\u00a0drivers to double their regular hourly wage if they were to work on that day.\nIn documents obtained by CBC News, it was revealed that staff in 2021 estimated that this provision alone would cost the city an additional $732,963 annually if it were to go ahead with Sunday service.\nDetails of new deal\nUnder the new collective agreement, the city's permanent part-time bus drivers would be scheduled to work Sundays, and would be entitled to an additional $1.25 per hour for working on that day.\nDrivers could still earn double pay for working on Sundays, but only if they work beyond 80 hours in a two-week period.\nFredericton transit manager Charlene Sharpe said the premium offered to part-time drivers for Sundays would put their wage in line with what full-time drivers make during the week and on Saturdays.\nFredericton transit manager Charlene Sharpe says transit drivers would earn an additional $1.25 per hour for working on Sundays.\n \n(Aidan Cox/CBC)\nShe said another improvement for part-time drivers is they'll now be compensated at up to 95 per cent of what full-time drivers earn.\nTheir wages will also escalate to that cap within 12 months of them starting, faster than the 24-month period it previously took for them to reach just 90 per cent of what full-time drivers earn, said Ralph McBride, the CUPE representative for city transit workers.\nUnion understood need for Sunday service\nMcBride said he's pleased with how negotiations went with the city, adding there was no friction when it came to removing the double-pay provision for working on Sundays.\nCUPE representative Ralph McBride says transit drivers were willing to get rid of the provision in the collective agreement entitling them to double pay for working on Sundays.\n \n(CBC)\n\"The union understood the importance of providing a service for people that, you know, need to get to the Regent\u00a0Mall or need to get to wherever \u2026\u00a0on Sundays, and for work purposes as well as for shopping,\" McBride said.\n\"So the union was well aware of that and\u00a0\u2026 they were prepared to look at [it with] an open mind about, you know, what's best for the city of Fredericton, the ridership.\"\nNo Sunday service just yet\nThe new collective agreement doesn't mean buses will hit the road on Sundays just yet.\nSharpe said the city still wants to follow through on its plan to analyze data on usage trends and conduct more public consultation.\nNew passenger counters recently installed on the city's buses, for instance,\u00a0showed the routes taking people\u00a0to the Regent Mall\u00a0were \nmore heavily used on Saturdays\n than on the average weekday.\nThe city also opened an \nonline survey\n last week to engage the public on how it can improve its transit service.\nSharpe said the information will be compiled and used to create a plan for implementing Sunday bus service starting in 2025.\n\"We want to make sure that whatever we put in place and whatever we recommend to council is going to meet the needs,\u00a0and certainly we don't want to put something out there that people are disappointed with or can't use,\" Sharpe said.",

        "content": "The City of Saint John wants its residents to party this summer.\nThis week, the city launched its Community Block Party Trailer, a vibrant 14-foot van holding a barbecue, a canopy, tables, chairs, games, hula hoops\u00a0and a sound system for party goers to blast tunes.\u00a0\nSaint John Mayor Donna Reardon said the goal is to bring communities together.\n\"In the summertime, especially when the weather is great, you want to get outside, you want to get out with the kids, you want to do something with your neighbours. It just helps facilitate that.\"\nSaint John Mayor Donna Reardon says the Trailer will help groups bring their neighborhoods together for fun on warm summer days. \n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC)\nFor those without a barbecue or the necessary supplies, the Community Block Party Trailer solves the problem.\n\"It's wildly simple,\" Reardon said. The van is free to rent\u00a0and can be booked online on the City of Saint John website. The only requirements are that people clean the equipment and stay within the city limits. Only\u00a0community groups, not individuals, should be the ones booking it, Reardon said.\u00a0\nLori Lambert, Saint John's supervisor for community development, proposed the Community Block Party Trailer when the city began prioritizing new recreational efforts\u00a0after several years of\u00a0events cancelled by\u00a0COVID-19.\u00a0\nThe trailer initiative received a budget of $45,000 for the trailer and its contents.\nWATCH | Check out Saint John's new block party trailer:\nBlock-rocking beats \u2014 and other party goodies \u2014 are a call away in Saint John\n7 hours ago\nDuration \n1:34\nIf you're hosting a party, the City of Saint John wants to help out with a new block party trailer that can book free of charge.\n\"It was definitely a worthwhile investment,\" Lambert said. \"Going forward, the cost is pretty minimal to maintain it.\"\nThe idea originated from a past community program called the Green Machine.\u00a0\nAlso free to book, community members were able to rent a van equipped with cleaning supplies for neighbourhood cleanups.\nSimilar in size, the Green Machine\u00a0comes with a long list of supplies, including rakes, shovels, pruning shears and safety equipment. It will be available to book again in Fall 2023.\u00a0\nLori Lambert, Saint John\u2019s supervisor for community development, attends the unveiling of the Community Block Party Trailer.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC)\nCurrently, the city allows one booking per day for the Block Party Trailer. The van is dropped off at the location and comes with a city staffer to oversee\u00a0maintenance.\nSaint John has a strong sense of neighbourhood solidarity, Lambert added.\n\"We're all very proud to say, 'I live in Greendale or I live in Lakewood Heights,\" she said. \"We want to celebrate those neighbourhoods, we want to celebrate our beautiful parks here in the city, so this is just another mechanism to do that.\"\u00a0",

        "content": "Prince Edward Islanders are paying more under the new federal clean fuel regulations in part because ethanol isn't mixed into the gasoline products generally sold in the province, a Summerside energy consultant says.\nJay Mackay said that kind of lower-carbon fuel reduces the environmental footprint of gas-powered vehicles, and is exactly the kind of product the new rules that came into effect on July 1 were designed to promote, by making them relatively cheaper to buy.\u00a0\nBut since gasoline-ethanol blends are not generally sold on the Island, and P.E.I. does not have rules in place to ban refineries from passing on the federal surcharges on full-carbon gas, Islanders have been paying around four\u00a0cents more per litre in the past three weeks.\u00a0\n\"We're missing out on a whole subset of fuels that nobody even thinks about,\" Mackay said of ethanol, a type of alcohol made from plants, such as corn and sugar beet. \"And alcohol is an extremely low-carbon fuel source... It would be a major cost saving for the people who want to use it.\"\nCanada will soon have new rules for clean fuel. Here's what they'll cost when you fill up\nGas, diesel prices up on the Island, mostly due to new federal standards\nThe Canadian Fuels Association told CBC News that \"in general, P.E.I. gasoline has no ethanol.\"\u00a0 \nIn neighbouring New Brunswick, however, many pumps do offer what's called E10 gasoline, consisting of 10 per cent ethanol and 90 per cent gasoline.\u00a0 \nEthanol has been blended in gasoline for many years in different parts of the country, but its use may increase as companies comply with the new federal clean fuel regulations. So far, the blends are not generally available on P.E.I.\n \n(Kyle Bakx/CBC)\nThat ethanol blend, which can be used in any gas-powered engine, is readily available in major markets in central and western Canada. In some American states,\u00a0gas stations offer blends with up to 15 per cent ethanol, known as E15 gasoline. You can even get E85 gas, though you'd need what's called a flex-fuel vehicle.\u00a0\nThe products\u00a0do\u00a0have their critics, though. The blends can\u00a0be more corrosive and fuel efficiency is three to four per cent lower than regular gasoline.\nSubhead\nIrving Oil operates one of Canada's biggest refineries in Saint John, N.B.\u00a0\nKatherine d'Entremont\u00a0from its corporate communications department\u00a0sent CBC News an email saying in part: \"We have been blending ethanol in gasoline for more than a decade in certain markets and continue to evaluate the availability and potential expansion of biofuel blended product within Atlantic Canada.\"\nCanadians to save at the pump this long weekend compared to last year\nDemand for biofuels sparks Canadian boom. But will U.S. subsidies pull investment south?\nThe company's 2022 sustainability report noted that Irving added biofuel blending capacity at its new Halifax Harbour Terminal last year. That facility introduced the capability to blend in ethanol to levels of up to 15 per cent in gasoline.\nThe new federal regulations reward gas and oil producers who make cleaner blends of fuel or invest in carbon reduction operations, such as electric car charging stations.\n \n(David Donnelly/CBC)\nIrving's report\u00a0said that move will reduce emissions equivalent to taking 45,000 passenger vehicles off the road a year.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"Our company is on a continuous journey of sustainable development, while continuing to provide safe and reliable energy to our customers,\" d'Entremont's email said.\u00a0\nLowering the carbon intensity\nThe Trudeau government brought in the new rules on July 1, 2023,\u00a0 because it wants oil and gas refiners to reduce the carbon intensity of their gas and diesel by 15 per cent by the year 2030, compared to 2016 levels.\nThe federal government has long said consumers shouldn't be bearing the financial burden of the new regulations, given oil refineries have been making record profits and could easily use some of that revenue to make their facilities greener.\u00a0\nThey can do that in a number of ways:\nMake gasoline with more ethanol or use more bio-diesel, both of which are less carbon-intensive alternatives.\nInvest in green projects such as carbon capture and storage.\nInstall electric vehicle charging stations at gas stations under their brand umbrellas.\u00a0\nGas and oil companies that meet federal targets for reducing their emissions intensity will earn extra credits they can sell to other companies. Producers that don't meet the targets by cleaning up their gas can buy those credits to stay in compliance.\nLess incentive to change?\nThe bottom line is that the federal government wants the big players in the industry to be facing higher costs unless they go greener, as an incentive for them to change. So far, that's not the way it's playing out in Atlantic Canada.\u00a0\nArthur Irving speaks at the opening of Irving's Halifax Harbour Terminal in November 2022. The company says the new facility will let it increase the amount of ethanol-blended gasoline it produces.\n \n(CBC)\nPremiers in the region have been lobbying for a break on the regulations, saying they will hurt consumers here harder than those in other areas of Canada, in part because most of our goods are trucked here.\u00a0\nIn at least two cases, though, provinces made it easier for citizens to be charged more.\u00a0\nClean fuel standard, future of the oilsands: Wilkinson on the tense relationship with Alberta\nAlberta will be at a 'competitive disadvantage' once Ottawa introduces new clean fuel policy: industry expert\nMoe Qureshi, the manager of climate solutions at the Conservation Council of New Brunswick, says his provincial government actually changed the rules recently so that any new costs could\u00a0be passed on to drivers.\nN.B. Premier Blaine Higgs said the rule change was meant to protect gas station owners, who would see their profit margins reduced and the viability of their business model hurt if refiners passed on the costs and those costs\u00a0couldn't trickle down to customers.\u00a0\nNova Scotia did the same thing.\nQureshi is not happy about that.\u00a0\nThe Irving Oil refinery in Saint John is the major supplier of gasoline and diesel products in Atlantic Canada and the northeast U.S.\n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC News)\n\"We're seeing that folks at the pump\u00a0are starting to pay more, and essentially paying the bills of industry. So there was no need to do that in my opinion...\u00a0They created a system that disincentivizes [companies] from making those innovation changes, because now they're getting extra money from the consumers.\"\nNo comment from P.E.I. government\nCBC News asked the P.E.I. government for comment on whether it followed New Brunswick's lead with regard to letting consumers be charged more for gas products now that the regulations are in place.\u00a0\nA week after the request was made, there was no reply from the province.\u00a0\nOttawa tells regulators oil industry profits should pay for new clean fuel requirements\nOil refiners want cost of reducing their carbon footprint rolled into N.S. pump price\nSo far, the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission has been left to figure out what costs should be passed on to P.E.I. consumers. That's what the province of Newfoundland and Labrador did as well.\u00a0\nOn P.E.I., IRAC is in the middle of a review of how much profit fuel retailers should be allowed to make, and that price margin discussion will take into account the impact of the new clean fuel regulations.",

He helped get the Mars Perseverance rover ready to collect samples on\u00a0the Red Planet.\nNASA rover worked on by P.E.I. scientist lands safely on Mars\nNow, he's developing instruments to analyze the jets of water on Enceladus.\nWillis said the plan is to have a new spacecraft with\u00a0a \"mouth\" to collect that water as it flies through the plumes \u2014 sort of like a whale or a \"big electronic bird.\"\n\"We're going to melt [the water]\u00a0and we're going to analyze what's in that water,\" he said.\n\"We can use the 'taste' to determine, Does this taste like some completely abiotic rock or does this taste like it has signs of life?\"\nTesting in progress\nThe plumes are very diffuse, Willis\u00a0said. They collect about one microlitre of water.\nFor comparison, a typical drop of water contains 25 microlitres.\nWillis said he's looking for something in the\u00a0samples that could reveal the possibility of life.\n\"The big target really is amino acids, the building blocks of proteins,\" he said.\nSaturn has 146 moons in total. It's largest one, Titan, is seen in orbit in this photo.\n \n(NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute)\nWillis said NASA has not approved the mission yet. The proposal will be submitted next year.\nIf approved, the launch would be sometime in the 2030s. Willis said the journey to Enceladus would take seven to eight years,\u00a0and that the\u00a0testing itself could take three.\n\"Best case scenario, we would actually execute these measurements in 2046,\" he said.\nWillis said he hopes he can culminate his career working on the project.",

So anything we can do to help is a win.\"\nTopServe CEO Nicholas Cameron said using the service is a more secure way to make sure farmers get the money for their products. \n \n(Submitted by Nicholas Cameron )\nMcCormick said the federation has been sharing the idea with its members.\n\"Some farmers later in the season have been talking to us maybe about using it at the farmer's market in the winter,\" she said. \"We've had some sweet corn farmers interested.\"\n'Most people are honest': Roadside stands show honour system still viable on P.E.I.\nBig uptake from P.E.I. farmers for climate funding\nThe service does have a cost.

        "content": "More than 200 people gathered in Mississauga at a candlelight vigil on Saturday for a Brampton food delivery driver who died after he was critically injured during a violent carjacking.\nGurvinder Nath, 24, an international student, was confronted at a delivery address shortly after 2 a.m. in the area of Creditview Road and Britannia Road West on July 9. His car was stolen and he was left on the side of the road with life-threatening injuries. He died in hospital five days later on July 14. Peel police say he was working for Pizza Pizza at the time.\nHis body will be flown to India on July 27, 2023, with the help of the Consulate General of India in Toronto. The date is exactly two years after he came to Canada with big dreams.\nSpeakers at the vigil at the parking lot of Paramount Fine Foods Centre, 5500 Rose Cherry Place, told the crowd that Nath came to Canada carrying the hopes of his family and now his family is dealing with grief at the loss of one of its three sons.\n\"You come to Canada with a dream. You start your life. But these people stole a dream,\" Bobby Sidhu, a friend of a relative of Nath, said.\nIn an interview later, Sidhu said: \"Canada was known for peace. And I hope that in our country such senseless and merciless crime will come to an end. Everyone could relate to Gurvinder. I think that's the reason the community has come together.\"\nGurvinder Nath, 24, was from the village of Karimpur Chahwala in Punjab, India.\n \n(Submitted by Balram Chaudhary)\nSiddhartha Nath, consul general of India in Toronto, said Nath's death is a \"heartrending loss\" and he extended his condolences to family members, friends and the wider community. He said the consulate general contacted the family after his death.\n\"It was heartening for me to see how the community responded, came together both online and physically to support the family in this time of grief,\" Nath said.\n\"Of course, nothing can make good the loss, but it will be some solace to the grieving family and it's also a signal of the spirit of the community because it is in times like this when the spirit and the solidarity and the sense of empathy is tested.\"\nNath said he hopes the people responsible are brought to justice.\nMississauga Coun. Brad Butt, who represents Ward 11, said Nath's death on \"what was just a regular night at work\" has shocked the city.\u00a0\n\"This is such a tragic day for all of us,\" Butt said. \"Please accept our very, very sincere condolences and may we move forward with peace and justice ahead.\"\nAfter the speakers, community members lit white candles on a table in front of a large photograph of Nath. Then community members carried the photograph of him through the parking lot and chanted in Punjabi.\n \n(CBC)\nAfter the speakers, community members lit white candles on a table in front of a large photograph of Nath. Then community members carried the photograph of him through the parking lot and chanted in Punjabi. Nath was from the village of Karimpur Chahwala in Punjab, India.\nIn a Facepost post, vigil organizer Gagandeep Kaur said: \"The devastating loss of Gurvinder has left his family shattered and heartbroken. Their decision to send him to Canada was filled with great aspirations, hoping that he would one day achieve full settlement in a new and promising land. Hailing from a middle-class family, Gurvinder was their beacon of hope, and his success held the key to a better future for them.\"\nNath was taking business administration courses at Loyalist College in North York and delivering pizza during the summer before going back to school in September, family friend Jaswinder Meelu has told CBC Toronto.\nPeel police said they are continuing to review CCTV video of the incident.\nPolice have released an image of a suspect vehicle, described as a white 2012 to 2017 Hyundai Accent, with a distinctive aftermarket flashing blue light at the top of the windshield. It was seen several times prior to the robbery taking place.\nPolice release new details about fatal carjacking, say victim was lured to location before attack\nFamily mourns Brampton delivery driver who died after carjacking, calls for justice\nPolice have said officers found Nath's vehicle abandoned in the area of Old Derry Road and Old Creditview Road in Mississauga hours after the incident.\nConst. Tyler Bell, spokesperson for Peel Regional Police, said officers believe at least two people were involved in the attack. Police have said they believe the food order was placed as a means of luring the driver to the area.\nA visitation for Nath will be held on Wednesday, July 26 from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Brampton Crematorium, Suite D and E, 30 Bramwin Court, in Brampton.",

        "content": "Several celebrities are settling into the director's chair and premiering their projects at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) this year,\u00a0including Viggo Mortensen, Michael Keaton, Chris Pine and Anna Kendrick.\nMortensen's Canadian co-produced western titled \nThe Dead Don't Hurt\n\u00a0is among the galas and special presentations announced by TIFF amid ongoing labour action in Hollywood that could change this year's festival experience.\nMeanwhile, Keaton directs and stars alongside Al Pacino in the thriller \nKnox Goes Away\n, with the\u00a0\nBirdman\n\u00a0actor playing\u00a0a hit man in danger of losing his memory. That film\u00a0\u2014 as well as\u00a0Pine's mystery/comedy \nPoolman\n, in which he co-stars with Annette Bening \u2014 will have its world premiere\u00a0at the festival.\nOther celebrities that are set to premiere\u00a0directorial projects at TIFF are Anna Kendrick, with \nWoman of the Hour\n,\u00a0and Kristin Scott Thomas, with \nNorth Star\n.\nHollywood strike could mean a Toronto International Film Festival with far fewer stars\nStrike by Hollywood actors expected to affect thousands employed in Toronto film, TV industry\nThe festival is a key platform for Hollywood to debut its fall fare and awards hopefuls. But like the Venice Film Festival, which begins about a week before TIFF launches on Sept. 7, Toronto organizers are anxiously following the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes.\nWhile those strikes continue, actors and writers are prohibited by their unions from promoting their films. TIFF will go forward, regardless, but an ongoing strike would sap the festival of A-listers and surely lessen the usual cacophony of buzz emanating from Toronto.\nCurrent strike action rules would likely prevent directors who also star in their film \u2014 such as Pine and Keaton \u2014 from promoting their work as an actor, but they'd be able to speak to the media\u00a0from a director's point of view.\nWATCH | What actors want you to know about the strike:\n\u00a0\nWhat Hollywood actors want you to know about the strike\n5 days ago\nDuration \n7:05\nResidual payments and the use of generative AI are the biggest issues in the SAG-AFTRA strike that shut down Hollywood. Actor Sean Gunn tells The National\u2019s Ian Hanomansing that the fight isn\u2019t for the stars, it\u2019s for the working actor trying to make ends meet.\nThe strike has already led to one of Venice's top titles \u2014 Luca Guadagnino's \nChallengers\n,\u00a0starring Zendaya \u2014 to pull out as the festival's opening night selection and postpone its release to April.\nNevertheless, several projects from notable directors like South Korean filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda (\nMonster\n) and British director Jonathan Glazer (\nThe Zone of Interest\n) will have their Canadian premieres at the festival.\nDirector Richard Linklater's\u00a0comedy-thriller\u00a0\nHitm\nan\n,\u00a0\nstarring Glen Powell as a Houston cop who works undercover as a hired assassin, will have its North American premiere at TIFF.\nElliot Page, Annie Murphy among Canadian talent\nNewly announced Canadian projects include Val-d'Or, Que.,-born director Sophie Dupuis's queer romance \nSolo\n,\u00a0which centres on a Montreal drag performer navigating family and relationship troubles.\nMontreal-based filmmaker Chlo\u00e9\u00a0Robichaud's\u00a0\nDays of Happiness, \nstarring Sophie Desmarais as a young orchestra conductor navigating a difficult relationship with her father-slash-agent, will have its world premiere at the fest\u00a0\u2014 as will \nSwan Song\n\u00a0by Langley, B.C. director Chelsea McMullan.\nAlso on the list is Dominic Savage's \nClose to You\n,\u00a0a Canada-United Kingdom co-production starring Elliot Page.\u00a0\nSchitt's Creek\n\u00a0star Annie Murphy will be featured in\u00a0\nFingernails \nby Greek filmmaker Christos Nikou.\nSeveral other familiar Canadian faces will appear on the big screen at TIFF this year. Craig Gillespie's\u00a0\nDumb Money\n\u00a0will co-star Seth Rogen, while Taika Waititi's previously announced soccer comedy\u00a0\nNext Goals Wins\n\u00a0will star Will Arnett. Atom Egoyan's\u00a0latest film\u00a0\nSeven Veils\n\u00a0will feature a largely Canadian supporting cast.\nCanadian rockers Nickelback will get the documentary treatment in\u00a0\nHate To Love: Nickelback\n\u00a0by director Leigh Brooks, which will juxtapose\u00a0the band's wild, multi-decade success with its love/hate\u00a0reputation.\nTIFF says its first announcement of 2023 selections includes seven international premieres, 37 world premieres, 12 North American premieres and four Canadian premieres.",

And awareness of women's soccer and the growth in women's professional soccer and what we're doing,\" Matheson said of the 32-country tournament, which runs July 20 to Aug. 20 across nine host cities in Australia and New Zealand.\n\"So, we'll definitely try and be visible during the Women's World Cup while that extra attention and eyeballs are on it, because every time we've been able to make a large announcement, we've got really quality inbound leads coming our way. The Women's World Cup is another platform where more eyes will be on women's soccer and that's always good for us.\"\nIn April, AFC Toronto City became the new league's third founding franchise, joining the Vancouver Whitecaps and Calgary Foothills. Matheson's plan is to launch a league in 2025 with eight teams split across two conferences.\nCorporate partners already on board are Air Canada, Canadian Tire, CIBC and DoorDash Canada.\nOpinion\nPro women's soccer initiative is a huge step forward for women's sports in Canada\nProject 8 has already received official league recognition from Canada Soccer.\nYou need only to look to the U.S. to see the importance of a domestic pro league. Twenty-two of the 23 players on the American World Cup roster play domestically in the National Women's Soccer League with Lindsey Horan, who is with French champion Olympique Lyonnais, the lone exception.\nCBA improved standards in U.S. loop\n\"I think that speaks to the growth of the NWSL, over the last 18 months to two years specifically,\" said Matheson, who played for four different NWSL clubs during her career.\nMatheson points to the players' collective bargaining agreement that improved standards in the U.S. league, as well as the entry of women-led franchises like Los Angeles-based Angel City FC.\nWATCH | Matheson discusses Toronto franchise with CBC Sports:\nCanadian professional women's soccer league announces Toronto as 3rd franchise\n3 months ago\nDuration \n0:58\nDiana Matheson, the CEO of Project 8, shares her excitement about a professional women's soccer team coming to Toronto. Vancouver and Calgary have been previously announced as team locations.\nNine of the 12 NWSL clubs are represented on the American roster.\nIn contrast, 13 of the 23 Canadians at the World Cup play their club football in Europe, with nine of those in England. Captain Christine Sinclair, who captains the Portland Thorns, is one of eight NWSL players. The other two are U.S. college players.\n\"It's been the case for however many World Cups now, when you go down the player list and see what club they play for, it's really only been Canada where the bulk of their players aren't playing at home,\" said Matheson. \"Hopefully this is the last World Cup we see that.\"\nChristine Sinclair, Diana Matheson reveal pro Canadian women's soccer league set for kickoff in 2025\n\"That's absolutely our goal,\" she added. \"I think we can provide a place for a good piece of the national team and many other Canadians who are either playing abroad or aren't yet playing pro.\n\"The more exciting thing for me is there's going to be names hopefully on that World Cup roster next time that we don't even know yet and that are coming up through the ranks in Canada and we get to know first through this pro league and then we get to watch them at the next Women's World Cup.\"\nWorld Cups have provided different memories for Matheson.\n2015 quarterfinal loss tough to swallow\nIn 2019, sidelined by injury, she enjoyed a new role as a TV analyst.

Outscored 7-1 by France, Germany and Nigeria, Canada finished 16th and last.\n\"That was heartbreak, but I think in some ways was the catalyst that led to 2012,\" Matheson said, referencing the bronze-medal run at the London Olympics under John Herdman. \"I think it focused us in a lot more on what we needed to do, especially when John came in.\"\nMatheson says the fourth-place finish in 2003 in the U.S., with Norwegian coach Even Pellerud at the helm, holds a special place in her heart. It was her first World Cup and first year on the Canadian team. After dispatching China 1-0 in the quarterfinals, Canada lost 2-1 to Sweden in the semifinal and 3-1 to the U.S. in third-place game.\n\"We came fourth, back in the day with Route 1 soccer, direct soccer. The midfielders mostly played defence and tried to win the ball and then get it to the forwards pretty quickly,\" she said. \"But it worked. And we almost squeaked through to a final.\"\n\"I have such fond memories of that team,\" she added. \"That was a team like London, like Tokyo (where Canada won Olympic gold in 2021) where you had a really core group of fantastic veterans that set the tone -- Charmaine Hooper, Andrea Neil, Silvana Burtini, so many others -- and this really young hungry group of kids coming up with Sinc [Christine Sinclair], myself, Erin McLeod.\"\nMore soccer coverage\nCanada failed to get out of the group stage in 2007 in China under Pellerud, conceding a 92nd-minute goal in a 2-2 tie with Australia that prevented the Canadians from moving on. Sinclair had scored in the 85th minute to give Canada the lead.\nMatheson recently earned her MBA from the Smith School of Business at Queen's University. She has also finished UEFA's Executive Master for International Players (MIP), a 20-month program designed to equip top international players with the tools required to transfer their playing strengths into effective management skills off the pitch.\nThe franchise fee for the proposed new women's league is $1 million with a need for an estimated $8 million to $10 million in total invested capital over the first five seasons in addition to necessary spending on infrastructure. Owners are buying a piece of the league as well as their own franchise.\nProject 8 Sports Inc. was founded by Matheson and Thomas Gilbert.\nMatheson's distinguished playing career included the stoppage-time goal that earned Canada a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics. She won 206 caps for Canada (including 193 starts) from 2003 to 2020.",

        "content": "Santiago Gimenez scored after an electrifying sprint in the 88th minute, and Mexico won the CONCACAF Gold Cup for the record ninth time with a 1-0 victory over Panama on Sunday night.\nAfter Edson Alvarez slid to block Ivan Anderson's cross in the Mexico penalty area, Orbelin Pineda dribbled away and made a tremendous pass into the centre circle. Gimenez, 22-year-old Feyenoord forward, dribbled past Harold Cummings and outraced Cummings and Fidel Escobar into the penalty area. Gimenez scuffed a bouncing left-foot shot over goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera for his fourth goal in 18 international appearances and his second of the tournament.\nThe goal by the Argentina-born Gimenez, who came on as a substitute only three minutes earlier, set off a frenzied celebration at SoFi Stadium, packed with fans celebrating Mexico's dramatic revival in this biennial CONCACAF tournament.\nSeveral months after Mexico crashed out of the World Cup with its worst performance in nearly half a century, El Tri rebounded with an excellent tournament under interim manager Jaime Lozano, who took over the beleaguered program only a month ago.\n\u00a1GOL DEL CAMPEONATO! \ud83c\udfc6 <a href=\"https://t.co/LNXZAlFxcJ\">pic.twitter.com/LNXZAlFxcJ</a>\n&mdash;\n@GoldCup\nMexico, which allowed just two goals in its matches, has won this tournament more than all other nations combined. The U.S. has seven Gold Cup titles and Canada one.\nGimenez's late goal ended an unlikely Gold Cup run by Panama, which upset the U.S. in the semifinals to earn its third appearance in the final. Los Canaleros couldn't get several solid scoring chances past veteran Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa.\nLozano, who coached Mexico's Olympic team to a bronze medal in Tokyo two years ago, was hired to lead the Gold Cup campaign by Juan Carlos Rodriguez, who took over as Mexican Football Federation president only a month earlier.\nWhile the Gold Cup is notorious for featuring half-strength national teams, Mexico began the final with eight starters who also started at the World Cup.\nWATCH l\u00a0Canadian men's national team takeaways from the Gold Cup:\nCanadian men's national team takeaways from the Gold Cup\n14 days ago\nDuration \n4:56\nHost Andi Petrillo speaks with OneSoccer analyst Oliver Platt about the young players that have impressed him most for Canada during the Gold Cup.\nMexico dominated play for most of the first half, but Panama defended impressively. Henry Martin appeared to put Mexico ahead in the 33rd minute with a close-range goal, but a video review several minutes after the play found him offside.\nPineda and Martin both had tantalizing chances in the 43rd minute, but Panama goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera stopped their consecutive point-blank shots.\nPanama got its best scoring chance shortly after halftime, but Alberto Quintero put his header just wide of the far post. Edgar Barcenas had another good-looking chance in the 87th minute, but missed wide from outside the box.\nMoments later, Gimenez scored his biggest goal for Mexico.\nAnybody who thought the absence of the hosts' national team would lead to an anticlimactic Gold Cup final doesn't know Southern California very well: The sellout crowd south of downtown Los Angeles was overwhelmingly dominated by fans of El Tri, which is treated like the home team whenever it plays in this area \u2014 even against the American team.\nHerdman drawing on positives to ease pain of Canada's Gold Cup loss to U.S.\nCanada suffers heartbreak on penalties against U.S. in Gold Cup quarterfinals\nBut this victory is an impressive reversal for Mexico, which failed to get out of World Cup group play in Qatar for the first time since 1978. That disappointment led to coach Tata Martino's departure and Diego Cocca's brief tenure before the arrival of Lozano, who largely relied on the core of his Olympic team at the Gold Cup.\nJust a month after frustrated Mexican fans boycotted the third-place match of the Nations League in Las Vegas against Panama, that passionate base returned in full voice to the Los Angeles Rams' palatial NFL stadium.\nPanama barely missed the World Cup last year, yet kept Spanish coach Thomas Christiansen. The decision paid off with inspired play in the Gold Cup, culminating in the nation's first trip to the final since 2013 with a victory over the host U.S. on penalties in San Diego.\nSoFi put down natural grass for the Gold Cup final instead of its usual artificial turf for American football, and the seams in the sod were very visible in a few places. The $5 billion US stadium is in contention to host the World Cup final in 2026, but seems unlikely to get it due to the narrowness of the field.\nWATCH l\u00a0U.S. bests\u00a0Canada on penalties:\nU.S. defeats Canada in penalty kicks at CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinal match\n16 days ago\nDuration \n2:06\nCanada lost to the Americans 3-2 on penalties Sunday night in CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinal action.",

        "content": "Rhonda Pauls remembers the thrill of being a young umpire and making that close\u00a0call at home plate: \"You're out!\"\nShe also remembers that shrinking feeling of seeing an enraged coach charge out of the dugout to tell her, among other things, that she's wrong.\n\"It was terrifying for me,\" Pauls said.\n\"Especially as a female on the field with, you know, large men and you have someone bearing down on you, red in the face, spitting sunflower seeds in your face, waving their arms, telling you that you're terrible and you made the wrong call and you've ruined the game for everybody.\nAngry coaches, nasty parents could be to blame for umpire shortage\nPlay ball! Maybe. Umpires needed for baseball across Manitoba\n\"It doesn't make you feel very good.\"\nPauls stuck with it, however, and is now an accomplished umpire who officiates high level games in Canada and the U.S.\u00a0\nRhonda Pauls, executive director of Baseball P.E.I., says umpires are the target of abuse that would not be tolerated in any other workplace setting.\n \n(Shane Ross/CBC)\nBut she doesn't want other umpires, especially young ones, to experience the kind of abuse she says wouldn't be tolerated in the grocery store, workplace or any other environment without repercussions.\nAs the new executive director of Baseball P.E.I., Pauls has introduced a new \"no confrontation\" policy that forbids coaches from U-18 teams and below from entering an umpire's space to dispute calls.\nUp to the ump to engage\nHere's how it works:\nCoaches are not permitted to argue \"judgment calls,\" such as balls and strikes, or safe and out calls on the bases.\n'Everybody's making mistakes on the field, but the umpires seem to be held to a different standard than everyone else,' says Rhonda Pauls.\n \n(Shane Ross/CBC)\nCoaches can, however, approach an umpire to question an interpretation of a rule, provided they remain off the field of play. Even then, it is up to the umpires to decide if they want to engage. Pauls said.\n\"We're hoping that the coaches, by virtue of the fact that they have to stop there and have that moment to wait for the umpire to approach, that they'll be able to collect themselves and keep the conversations respectful, which is really all we're looking for.\"\nThe coaches and team officials are responsible for keeping their fans from heckling the umpires.\nSafe and out calls are among the most contentious decisions umpires have to make.\n \n(Racheal Grazias/Shutterstock)\n\"You can usually tell by the direction of the comments, which side of the field the spectator is supporting,\" Pauls said.\u00a0 \n\"So the umpire will now be going to the coach and saying, 'You know, grandpa in the blue jacket back there is commenting on every ball and strike in disagreement with me. I can't focus. I need that to stop.'\"\nA breach of the rule\u00a0could result in an automatic ejection.\n \nIt takes a certain comfort level to expect a teenager to be able to deal with\u2026\u00a0the misbehaviour of an adult.\n\u2014 Mike Richards\nMike Richards, the supervisor of umpires for Baseball P.E.I., says the new policy will help make it easier to\u00a0recruit\u00a0and retain\u00a0umpires, about 75 per cent of whom are in their teens and making about $35 a game.\nHe said there were times, following a confrontation with a coach, when he wanted to \"crawl into a hole\" and get the game over as soon as possible. Over the years, the abuse of officials has become normalized, he said, leaving many to reconsider their decision to become an umpire.\n\"It takes a certain comfort level to expect a teenager to be able to deal with or, you know, handle the misbehaviour of an adult,\" Richards said.\n\"So we wanted to essentially look at these situations and try to find and focus on a solution to prevent it or eliminate it from the game altogether.\"\n'It shouldn't be a thing'\nThe rule is working \"pretty smooth\" so far this season, said 13-year-old Xavier Power, a second-year umpire on P.E.I.\u00a0\u2014 though he wishes it wasn't needed in the first place.\n\"Coaches should not be yelling at umpires anyway. It shouldn't be a thing.\"\nXavier Power, 13 and in his second year of umping, says coaches should never be yelling at umpires.\n \n(Submitted by Jillian Power)\nPower said he became an umpire because he loves to watch baseball. He said the experience has been positive. Sometimes he might hear a \"snort\" from a hitter who thought a strike was a ball, but everyone has been on their best behaviour.\nPower said\u00a0there are times when umpires will make mistakes, but the new rule makes him more confident about how to address it.\n\"You have to say, 'I messed up'\u2026 Yeah, you do feel embarrassed.\"\nAll right to be wrong\nPauls said it should be OK for umpires to get a call wrong sometimes.\n\"Everybody's making mistakes on the field, but the umpires seem to be held to a different standard than everyone else.\n \nIf a player lets the ground ball through their legs because they didn't get their glove down on the ground out in front, nobody yells at them for it.\n\u2014\u00a0Rhonda Pauls\n\"When the coach makes a mistake, you don't usually see the players or parents berating them for it. If a player lets the ground ball through their legs because they didn't get their glove down on the ground out in front, nobody yells at them for it. They say, 'Hey, that's OK, we'll get it next time.'\"\nBut when an umpire makes a mistake?\n\"'Boy, that was terrible. You're terrible. You shouldn't be here.' Well, if they weren't here, we wouldn't have a game. So that's kind of what we're trying to change the culture of.\"\nIsland Morning\n7:25\nNew rules to hinder abuse on the diamond\nExecutive director of Baseball P.E.I.

That's how Bobby Ray described his organization's decision to cancel the northern Ontario regional women's curling championship, scheduled to begin next week in Kenora, Ont.\nThe executive director of the Northern Ontario Curling Association said the winner of that competition would have gone on to represent Team Northern Ontario at the national bonspiel, the Scotties Tournament of Hearts.\nIt's a decision that is in line with several other provincial curling associations, including Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Quebec, which have also cancelled their qualifying tournaments.\nYet, the national championship, which will see 16 teams from across the country compete, is still scheduled to go ahead at the end of January in Thunder Bay, Ont., according to Nolan Thiessen, the executive director of marketing and fan experience with Curling Canada.\nWomen provide successful test of Calgary's curling bubble ahead of Brier\nMen's curling worlds playoffs on hold due to positive COVID-19 tests in Calgary bubble\n\"We're just working on the plans right now in terms of how we can make sure we can increase testing, increase protocols to make sure everybody is healthy and safe when they come to Thunder Bay,\" Thiessen told CBC News on Wednesday afternoon.\nThat decision is based off the recommendations of medical staff and advisors with Curling Canada, and with the experience of successfully hosting a national tournament last year in Calgary using the \"bubble\" concept, where all events were held without spectators and strict COVID-19 restrictions.\nCurling Canada to require COVID-19 vaccinations to attend or play in events\n\"What we're just trying to do now is take our protocols that worked there, and just tailor them to whatever we need.\"\nThe confirmation comes as other major sporting events have been cancelled, including Curling Canada's own Mixed Doubles Olympic Trials event, scheduled to take place this week.\u00a0\nMost recently, the International Ice Hockey Federation announced Wednesday it was \ncancelling the remainder of the world junior men's hockey championship\n in Edmonton after three games were forfeited due to positive COVID-19 test results. The federation had already announced the cancellation of all events beginning in January, \nincluding the under-18 women's championship.\nSelection of teams varies across the country\nThe 16 teams that participate in the Scotties Tournament of Hearts include representatives from each of Canada's 13 provinces and territories, a team from northern Ontario, the defending champion (Team Canada) and a wild card team.\nIn a typical year, the 14 provincial teams are determined by qualifying tournaments in the lead up to the national championship. Last year, most of those provincial championships were cancelled, with the respective curling associations choosing who would go on to the national competition.\nThis year, it's more complicated.\nThe northern Ontario women's curling championship, and qualifier for the 2022 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, was scheduled to take place next week in Kenora, Ont., before it was cancelled.\n \n(Martha Dillman/CBC)\nBobby Ray of the Northern Ontario Curling Association says they still haven't decided who will represent the region, nor have they determined how the team will be selected. Curling Quebec has also not yet selected their representative.\u00a0\nOther provincial curling associations, like Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick, have cancelled their qualifying tournaments and indicated the representatives will be selected based on national rankings.\nManitoba and Nunavut have already held their provincial/territorial championships and selected the teams that will represent them at the national tournament.\nSkip Kerri Einarson, above, and her team will wear the colours of Team Canada as the returning champions at the 2022 Scotties Tournament of Hearts.\n \n(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\nSeveral other provinces and territories, including Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, the Yukon and Northwest Territories, have not yet publicly announced that they will cancel their qualifying tournaments.\nThe provincial curling associations must submit the names of the teams that will go on to the Scotties Tournament of Hearts by January 9.\nScotties organizing committee still planning for spectators\nLess than a month away from the scheduled start of the national women's championship tournament, the organizing committee for the Scotties say they are still planning to host the tournament in Thunder Bay.\nDiane Imrie, the vice chair of special events and volunteers, said they are still hoping the tournament can run with at least 50 per cent capacity in the Fort William Gardens, as per provincial guidelines.\nDiane Imrie is the vice chair of special events and volunteers with Thunder Bay's Scotties 2022 organizing committee.\n \n(Matt Prokopchuk / CBC)\nThe 2021 tournament was supposed to be hosted in Thunder Bay, before COVID-19 forced Curling Canada to change the venue to Calgary. Then, Thunder Bay was told it would be able to host the 2022 version of the event.\nBut the organizing committee has already been forced to suspend ticket sales, after Ontario announced updated COVID-19 restrictions in response to the Omicron variant on Dec. 17.\nScotties Tournament of Hearts ticket sales suspended due to new COVID-19 restrictions\nThunder Bay to host Scotties Tournament of Hearts one year later than expected\n\"We want to be able to host here in Thunder Bay.

        "content": "Dan Snyder has a deal in place to sell the NFL's Washington Commanders for the biggest price paid for a North American professional sports team.\nA group led by Josh Harris and Mitchell Rales that includes Magic Johnson has an agreement in principle to buy the team for a record $6.05 billion US, two people with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Thursday.\nThe people confirmed the deal was a fully financed, nonexclusive agreement that was not yet signed. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal hasn't been finalized.\nAnother person told The AP a deal hasn't been sent to the NFL for approval yet. The league declined to comment.\nOnce the deal is approved, Harris would own controlling stakes in teams in three of the four major North American pro sports leagues. He and David Blitzer have owned the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers since 2011 and the NHL's New Jersey Devils since 2013.\nHarris has owned a piece of the Pittsburgh Steelers, which he needs to sell before getting the Commanders.\nThe price for the Commanders tops the previous record of $4.65 billion set when Walmart heir Rob Walton's group bought the Denver Broncos last year. Johnson, the basketball Hall of Famer who also owns part of Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, was also part of Harris's bid for the Broncos.\nMagic Johnson is part of a group that includes Josh Harris and Mitchell Rales.\n \n(Richard Shotwell/Invision/The Associated Press)\nRales, co-founder of the Danaher Corp. and a Maryland resident, and Johnson were relatively late additions to the group. Rales and Harris grew up in Bethesda in the Washington suburbs and give the team local ownership roots.\nThe sale of the Commanders is pending the execution of a contract and then approval from the rest of the league's owners, which could happen as soon as their next meeting in Minnesota in May but may take longer. It would need 24 of 32 votes to pass, which is not expected to be a problem after the Broncos sale was unanimously approved and given that Snyder was beginning to fall out of favor with the group.\nSnyder bought his boyhood favorite team in 1999 for $750 million and despite mounting criticism repeatedly said he'd never sell. That changed after multiple investigations by the league and Congress into Washington's workplace misconduct and potential improprieties. The congressional investigation found Snyder played a role in a toxic culture.\nIndianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay in October became the first to suggest there was \"merit to remove\" Snyder, a nearly unprecedented move that would have also taken a three-quarters majority to happen. Instead, two weeks later, Snyder and wife Tanya hired Bank of America Securities to explore a possible sale of the team.\nMagic Johnson joins Josh Harris' bid to buy NFL's Washington Commanders: report\nHouse report: Dan Snyder had role in 'toxic' Commanders culture\nCommanders sued again by D.C., this time for cheating fans out of ticket money\nIt quickly became apparent the Snyders, who bought out the previous minority owners in 2021, were not looking to maintain a controlling interest. Canadian investor Steve Apostolopoulos and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta were among the other bidders after early interest from Washington-area businessman Todd Boehly and mortgage executive Mat Ishbia, who instead paid $4 billion for the NBA's Phoenix Suns and WNBA's Mercury.\nThe group led by Apostolopoulos was the only other one to submit a fully financed bid.\n'End of a long, difficult chapter'\nLawyers representing over 40 former team employees hailed the news of an agreement in principle, saying it \"marks the end of a long, difficult chapter\" for their clients and fans. Lisa Banks and Debra Katz welcomed the new owners and said they \"hope a new chapter can truly begin\" within the organization.\nHarris and Rales will soon assume control of a once-storied franchise that has fallen far from its 1980s and early '90s glory days, when Washington won the Super Bowl three times. With Snyder in charge, the team made the playoffs just six times in 24 seasons, only twice won a postseason game and went 166-226-2 overall.\nThe new owners will inherit coach Ron Rivera, who has run Washington's football operations for three seasons, none with a winning record, including an NFC East title at 7-9 in 2020 followed by a first-round loss.\nTheir biggest immediate challenge for the long-term future of the organization is a new stadium to replace FedEx Field, the rushed-to-completion home of the team since 1997 in Landover, Maryland, that has not aged well. Virginia abandoned a stadium bill last spring given the number of off-field controversies swirling around the team.\nGetting fans back is a major priority after Washington ranked last in the league in attendance in 2022 and were second-last in 2021. The team rebranded last year as the Commanders after dropping their longtime name\u00a0in the summer of 2020 and going by the Washington Football Team for two seasons.\nCommanders settle with Washington, D.C., on fans' season-ticket deposit money\nIt was not immediately clear what latitude Harris and Rales might have to make their own changes to the team name, logo or other aspects of design, or if they have any interest in changing course when they take over.",

        "content": "Sechs\n. That was the number of goals scored with\u00a0precision by Germany on Morocco's Atlas Lionesses in their Women's World Cup debut on Monday.\nGermany, ranked No. 2 in the world,\u00a0is a strong contender\u00a0to win the tournament and\u00a0their star striker, Alexandra Popp, is on course to win the Golden Ball (for best player) and possibly the Golden Boot (as top scorer).\u00a0\nI am captivated by the Moroccan team,\u00a0and so were many of the more than\u00a027,256 fans that attended the match at Melbourne's Rectangular Stadium.\nMorocco (known as \nal Maghreb \nin Arabic) is the first Arab country and North African team to qualify for the Women's World Cup. Their men's team thrilled football fans and surprised supporters all over the world just six months ago at the men's tournament in Qatar, advancing all the way to the semifinals before losing to France. I stood alongside\u00a0exuberant fans in Doha who cheered and celebrated irrespective of the result. A pride just swept across the entire region.\u00a0\nI am cognizant of the importance of their presence at this tournament because of Nouhaila Benzina. She is the first hijab-wearing player at a senior Women's World Cup. (Jordan hosted the U17 WWC in 2016 and a few of their players wore head scarves.)\u00a0Benzina became a symbol for inclusion in a sport that not too long ago\u00a0did not permit hijab-wearing women to play.\nI am one of the few journalists in the world with an expertise on Muslim women in sport, and uniform and hijab accommodation, having covered\u00a0hijab bans by FIFA, FIBA and other international sports governing bodies for more than 10 years. I know what it took to \nopen the doors\n for women who look like me and millions of others who love this sport \u2014 and I understand the impact.\u00a0\nAt the pre-match press conference, a journalist asked Morocco's skipper, Ghizlane Chebbak, about Benzina and the impact she might have. Chebbak did not answer that question directly and while it could be that the FIFA translation service was not spot on, it could also be something more layered.\u00a0\nAfter tying Nigeria, Canada prepares to face well-drilled Ireland at Women's World Cup\nROUNDUP\nPopp's pair powers Germany to a 6-0 rout of Morocco at Women's World Cup\nWatch Soccer North Live Wednesday July 26th at 10:30 am ET on\u00a0\ncbcsports.ca\n\u00a0and the CBC Sports YouTube Channel for post-match analysis of Canada vs. Ireland with Andi Petrillo and Diana Matheson.\nAfter the squad was announced in early July, I reached out to contacts at the Royal Moroccan Football Federation and they told me that they would be happy to discuss the issue of hijab after the tournament. Perhaps they do not want her to be known for her hijab and instead for the footballer she is. She has the right to control the narrative around her.\u00a0\nI also talked with Moroccan journalists about Benzina and the importance of her hijab. They told me that questions around her hijab aren't asked by Moroccan media. For them, it is completely normal. Athletes in different tiers and leagues play with or without hijab and both are readily accepted.\u00a0\nWATCH: Knee injuries plague women's soccer:\nKnee injuries plague women soccer stars\n2 days ago\nDuration \n2:40\nSeveral top women players are missing the FIFA World Cup because of knee injuries. Research shows women are more prone than men, but experts say the reasons go far beyond biology.\nMuslim-majority places don't struggle with juxtapositions or perceptions of covered Muslim women who play elite sports like Western countries might \u2014 for them it's just the same. But as someone from Canada, who is a part of a small minority who wears hijab, \nit matters\n\u00a0how it might affect other Muslim girls from racialized communities who aren't vastly represented.\nMy friend, Dr. Nida Ahmad, is a sociologist who specializes\u00a0in Muslim women in sport and is in Australia.\u00a0She told me that even after the match, fans stayed for more than\u00a0an hour just to keep supporting the team.\n\"We danced for almost an hour and waited for the team to send them some love,\" she wrote\u00a0in a text message and attached a wonderful video of fans with tambourines or flags\u00a0cheering happily.\nThe people love the Atlas Lionesses. As they should. There has been huge investment in football in Morocco and the women's side is not an afterthought. There is a movement of girls' football, a revolution on the pitch. It comes with a ponytail or with a hijab and it is\n booming\n.\u00a0\nPrior to the game, manager\u00a0Reynald Pedros said the Moroccan federation gave him \"carte blanche\" and offered resources and support in whatever way the team\u00a0needed. That Included\u00a0unlimited access to the beautiful Mohammed VI football complex in Sal\u00e9, outside of Morocco's capital of Rabat. The vision for advancing women's football comes from a four-year plan that was established in 2020. It focuses on supporting grassroots development programs and the professional leagues. Morocco is the only country in the world that has two tiers of professional women's football.\u00a0\nThe Mohammed VI Complex in Morocco \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\udde6 covers almost 30 hectares with an overall investment of $65.4m built over a period of 3 years.<br><br>The facility is used by all the national football teams including the seniors, U23s, U20s and U17s - female and male. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe<br><br>\ud83c\udfa5: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaghribFoot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MaghribFoot</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6DAyWZ3Xaf\">pic.twitter.com/6DAyWZ3Xaf</a>\n&mdash;\n@UsherKomugisha\nBut one of the most impactful aspects may be off the field, which is not lost on Chebbak. Prior to the match, she talked about shouldering a big responsibility and inspiring the other footballers in Morocco.\n\"We are not here just to make up numbers. We are here to compete,\" she said in Darija, the Moroccan dialect of Arabic.\nWhile representing and inspiring is crucial, the goal of the Atlas Lionesses is to play soccer and play it well. This is a testament to their goals. Pedros added that support from back home was \"fantastic, exceptional and unimaginable\".\u00a0\nIt's refreshing to see attitudes of support and encouragement from the federations of new teams at the Women's World Cup \u2014 and ones that can set positive precedents.\u00a0\nMoroccan fans outside Melbourne\u2019s rectangular stadium after the 0-6 loss to Germany. Still bringing the vibe to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFAWWC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FIFAWWC</a>.

We want to get big and we're not stopping.\"\nThere are times when soccer isn't about the score or the technical playing, it is about the legacy and creating paths and opportunities for those young girls who come after.\nTheir first match may not have had the result they wanted, but Morocco is winning in other ways. The impact of their first appearance can be heard from the cheering of young fans on the streets of Casablanca, playing on the beaches of Essaouira or from the stands in Melbourne.\nOr it can be felt by a young girl in Canada who wears a hijab and sees Benzina training with her team and knowing that she, too, might have a future on the pitch someday.\u00a0",

And the Irish pressed hard as the clock wound down, using their prowess at set pieces to make for a tense finale.\n\"They're a team full of heart, spirit and passion,\" said Priestman. \"What I do know that is when we get tested by teams like that, you often see the best of this team.\"\nWatch Soccer North Live Wednesday July 26th at 10:30 am ET on\u00a0\ncbcsports.ca\n\u00a0and the CBC Sports YouTube Channel for post-match analysis of Canada vs. Ireland with Andi Petrillo and Diana Matheson.\nPriestman praised Ireland for what she called its \"We'll do whatever it takes not to concede\" mindset.\nThat fire was shown by Irish centre back Louise Quinn, who put her body on the line against the Matildas. The Birmingham City defender, who has 105 caps, emerged from the game sporting a black eye and wearing a walking boot.\nIt's a foot injury \"that is not very straightforward,\" according to Ireland coach Vera Pauw. \"We think that she can play.

Canada could have used her against Nigeria whose 'keeper, Paris FC's Chiamaka Nnadozie, made a world-class save early in the second half to stop Christine Sinclair's spot kick.\nWATCH\u00a0| Was letting Christine Sinclair take the penalty vs Nigeria a mistake?\nWas letting Christine Sinclair take the penalty vs Nigeria a mistake? | Soccer North\n5 days ago\nDuration \n5:36\nHost Andi Petrillo is joined by former Canadian keeper Stephanie Labb\u00e9 to react to Canada vs Nigeria in the Women's World Cup.\nThe Canadians already feel the absence of the versatile Janine Beckie, a difference-maker in attack who is back home recovering from knee surgery, and veteran defensive midfielder Desiree Scott, who lost her injury race against time.\nAnother question-mark arose at Canada's training session Tuesday when veteran centre back Kadeisha Buchanan did not take part in the portion open to the media. Buchanan had been slated to appear with Priestman at the earlier media availability but was replaced by Lawrence with Canada Soccer, in announcing the change earlier in the day, providing no explanation why.\nAT WOMENS WORLD CUP\nCanadians welcome physical challenge from Katie McCabe and Ireland in Game 2 of Women's World Cup\nIreland will be just as motivated as Canada. A loss, coupled with Australia avoiding defeat against Nigeria on Thursday, and the Irish are eliminated from advancing in its debut World Cup.\n\"If you play a game like this against the Olympic champion, you have to stay realistic,\" said Pauw. \"But it's clear that If we want to go through this group then we need a result.

At the end of the day, you've seen top-10 teams, teams that have won a World Cup, go and only beat them 1-0,\" she said. \"By no means are we going into this game thinking this is going to be an easy game.

Now they just have to cross their fingers and hope they get the nod when the decision is finally made.\n\"It's definitely hard on the heart,\" Homan said Tuesday from Beaumont, Alta.\nJocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant are ranked No. 1 in Canada but both are already Beijing-bound after victories in the four-player team trials last November in Saskatoon.\nPeterman helped Team Jennifer Jones to victory and Gallant helped Team Brad Gushue win the men's berth. Jones and Brent Laing are ranked second in mixed doubles.\nGiven the unique scenario, it's possible \u2014 although seemingly unlikely \u2014 that Curling Canada could make an exception to its rule. Many countries allow players to compete in both disciplines at the Games, but it appears doubtful the Canadian federation would want to disrupt team plans at this late date.\nNancy Martin and Tyrel Griffith are ranked third ahead of Lisa Weagle and John Epping. Weagle is part of Jones's five-player team but is eligible for mixed doubles since she's listed as an alternate for Beijing.\nAnother potential contender is the duo of Kerri Einarson and Brad Jacobs. Einarson, who won the Canadian mixed doubles title last season with Gushue, planned to play the trials with Jacobs.\n'You can't go and prove yourself'\nRankings and recent results will likely impact the decision-making process. Experience in major events like world championships and Olympic Games could also be factors.\nMorris said he was \"champing at the bit\" to get on the ice before the playdowns were cancelled.\n\"Rachel and I had a great training camp leading up to the trials,\" he said in a recent interview. \"We were so ready to go. That's the hard part. You can't go and prove yourself.\"\nSweden, Great Britain, Switzerland, Norway and the United States are some of the headliners in the 10-team Olympic mixed doubles field.\n\"I would absolutely love to have the chance to take them on but I'm sure there's some other curlers that are saying that too,\" Morris said from Canmore, Alta. \"I just love going to battle against the world's best and I would absolutely love that opportunity.\"\nCurling Canada cancels mixed doubles Olympic trials due to COVID-19 cases among athletes\nJAN 3 COVID ROUNDUP\nOntario Scotties Tournament of Hearts suspended due to provincial restrictions\nHoman, meanwhile, is also waiting for news on another curling front. The Ontario Curling Association recently suspended its Jan. 5-9 provincial championship in Thornhill due to new restrictions in the province.\nOn Friday, the association plans to declare a representative for the Jan. 28-Feb. 6 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Thunder Bay, Ont.\n\"It has just been a crazy couple of weeks really,\" Homan said. \"Just so many emotions that come with it.\"\nHoman, a three-time national champion who has led Ontario to three straight Scotties final appearances, would normally be a slam dunk for selection.\nHowever, if she gets the Olympic mixed doubles call, it could open the door for Ontario contenders like Team Hollie Duncan (ranked sixth in Canada) or Team Jacqueline Harrison (tied for sixth at trials).\nMore cancellations\nThe 2022 Canadian Under-18 Championships were postponed Tuesday due to ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic, Curling Canada said.\nThe event was scheduled for Feb. 14-20 in Timmins, Ont. The federation said it will try to reschedule the competition for later this year in a different location.\nJAN 4 COVID ROUNDUP\nMatthews-McDavid Wednesday showdown may be wiped out by Oilers star's positive test\nThe 2023 U18 nationals will be held in Timmins next year. Curling Canada also said the inaugural Under-23 Lethbridge Classic in March will be cancelled.\nSuper Sunday\nFive different provincial and territorial championships were on tap this week to fill out the field at the upcoming Canadian women's curling championship.\nFinals were set for Sunday in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories.\nMore curling coverage\nKerri Einarson's team will wear Canada colours at the 2022 Scotties. The Manitoba-based rink will be joined by Christina Black (Nova Scotia), Brigitte MacPhail (Nunavut), Sarah Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador) and Mackenzie Zacharias (Manitoba) in the field.\nOntario, Northern Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have either cancelled or suspended their playdowns and have yet to announce their representatives. A single wild-card team will also be added.\nThe men's national championship, the Tim Hortons Brier, is set for March 4-13 in Lethbridge, Alta.",

A provincial backup team waiting in the wings.\nRachel Homan, her teammates and other affected players could only wait things out after the Ontario Curling Association added a fresh wrinkle to a long, unprecedented selection process on several fronts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe OCA's decision Friday to announce that Homan's team would only represent the province at the national championship if the skip wasn't picked for the Olympic mixed doubles team generated criticism from some corners and confusion from others.\nIt also raised eyebrows at the prospect of Homan's teammates \u2014 Emma Miskew, Sarah Wilkes and Joanne Courtney \u2014 potentially being ruled out by the association through no fault of their own. Rather than let the team play with a substitute, the OCA declared that Team Hollie Duncan would get the nod as Team Ontario if Homan were not available.\nThat Curling Show\nCanadian mixed doubles curlers in flux, air thoughts on Olympic selection process\nCurlers await looming Olympic team decision after cancellation of mixed doubles trials\nCourtney, reached Saturday in Edmonton, said the team was \"definitely surprised\" at the association's \"contingency plan.\"\n\"Really disappointed,\" she said. \"A lot of emotions yesterday. It has been tough to take. Obviously we appreciate that it's hard for everyone. Selection is never an ideal situation for any team.\"\nCanada's Olympic mixed doubles trials were cancelled on Boxing Day due to COVID-19 issues. Pandemic restrictions forced the recent cancellation of Ontario's playdowns as well.\nWith the regular playdown process wiped out, Curling Canada will pick a pairing \u2014 in consultation with Own the Podium and the Canadian Olympic Committee \u2014 to wear the Maple Leaf at the Feb. 4-20 Beijing Games.\nAn announcement on the selection is expected sometime next week. Homan and John Morris, who teamed with Kaitlyn Lawes to win gold in the discipline's Olympic debut in 2018, are considered strong contenders.\nWATCH l Mixed doubles curlers debate who should represent Canada at the Olympics:\nMixed doubles curlers debate who should represent Canada at the Olympics\n2 years ago\nDuration \n1:12:06\nWith a mixed doubles gold medal to defend, curlers Kerri Einarson, Wayne and Kim Tuck, Tyrel Griffith and Chelsea Carey weigh in on who they think should represent Canada.\nThe OCA cited the Canadian Team Ranking System (CTRS), strength of field data and competition history in its final decision. Homan's team is ranked fifth in Canada, just a few points ahead of Duncan.\n\"Our mindset, thinking if we were to be selected and if Rachel were to be made unavailable, we would have been thrilled to choose one of the top Ontario curlers,\" Courtney said. \"We'd have them come into the lineup and see how far we could go and see what we could do. Playing in the Scotties is one of the biggest thrills.\"\nDuncan, meanwhile, said it has been a \"roller-coaster of emotions\" over the last week.\n\"Obviously you want to win your province and earn your way there but if we were given the opportunity to represent Ontario we would be extremely honoured and excited,\" she said in a text message.\n\"Hopefully the decision about mixed doubles doesn't take too much longer.\"\nDetails still not clear\nIn its news release, the OCA did not provide details on why Team Homan could not use a sub or alternate player if needed.\nHowever, in an email exchange later in the day, OCA executive director Stephen Chenier said the Homan rink would fall behind Duncan by a \"significant amount of points\" if they brought in a replacement.\nEssentially, Chenier said, points were earned by the team as a whole but if a player were to leave, they would take their rankings points with them.\n\"In this case with such a close race is it fair to Team Duncan that Team Homan gets to field a different squad [than]\u00a0what earned the points,\" Chenier said in an email.\nNorthern Ontario curling teams disappointed no qualifiers for national championships\nFor a team to count CTRS points toward its total, it must have at least three of four registered players on the ice at events.\nIt wasn't immediately clear why Homan's points would be taken away for a potential one-time scheduling conflict or why the team couldn't play as a threesome if required.\nA follow-up email to Chenier wasn't immediately returned.\n'We're definitely confused'\n\"I would say we're definitely confused about the ruling,\" Courtney told The Canadian Press. \"Someone getting the highest honour in sport \u2014 to go to the Olympics \u2014 having that be a limiting factor for the remaining three out of four to continue to compete, we're definitely confused there.\"\nThird-ranked Laura Walker, who has subbed on Homan's team in the past, weighed in on the issue via Twitter.\n\"So if Rachel got sick or injured before the Scotties, TeamHoman could still play with 3/4. But if she goes to represent our country, they can't? I'm confused. Aren't there 4 people on a curling team?\" she tweeted.\nTeam Kevin Koe lead Ben Hebert didn't mince words with his thoughts on the OCA statement.\n\"Full on dumpster fire release here!!!,\" Hebert tweeted, complete with head-smack and vomit emojis.\nTeam John Epping vice Ryan Fry also weighed in.\n\"Congrats on the Scotties berth, kinda? Nice position to put a player in,\" he tweeted.\nSubstitutes unusual,\u00a0but sometimes needed in curling\nWhile rare, substitute players are occasionally needed at big events.\nOne notable example came at the 2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Team Jennifer Jones brought in Shannon Birchard at vice to replace Lawes, who was competing at the Pyeongchang Olympics.\nJones won the competition and Lawes later returned to the lineup to help the team win world gold.\nHoman and Morris, meanwhile, are fifth in the Canadian mixed doubles rankings but both have Olympic experience.\nJocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant are ranked No. 1 in Canada but they are already Beijing-bound after victories in the four-player team trials (with Team Jennifer Jones and Team Brad Gushue, respectively).\nMore Curling coverage\nCurling Canada rules prevent athletes from playing in both disciplines at the same Games.\nJones and Brent Laing are ranked second ahead of Nancy Martin and Tyrel Griffith and the duo of Lisa Weagle and John Epping. Weagle is part of Jones's five-player team but is eligible for mixed doubles since she's listed as an alternate for Beijing.\nAnother potential contender is the duo of Kerri Einarson and Brad Jacobs. Einarson, who won the Canadian mixed doubles title last season with Gushue, had planned to play the trials with Jacobs.\n\"With mixed doubles getting cancelled, we've all been hoping and supporting and really staying excited for Rachel,\" Courtney said. \"We want her to go to the Olympics. That would be such a thrill.\n\"She's a phenomenal curler, she's a phenomenal mixed doubles player. I think her and John would be fantastic reps.\"\nNational sports organizations must submit their lists of nominated athletes to the COC by Jan. 19.",

        "content": "It's not a complete surprise that curling and other sports have been cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that\u00a0doesn't make it any easier on teams that had their hopes of representing Northern Ontario at a national curling level dashed.\nThe Northern Ontario Curling Association cancelled the 2022 Northern Ontario playdowns, which were slated to be held this week in Kenora. The event was cancelled last week.\nThe event has both men's and women's curling teams from across the region compete to determine who represents the area at the Scotties Tournament of Hearts\u00a0and Tim Horton's Brier.\u00a0The Scotties are slated to be held in Thunder Bay, beginning later this month, with the Brier set for Lethbridge, Alta., in March.\nOn Friday, the Northern Ontario Curling Association announced it had selected the team led by Krista McCarville out of the Fort William Curling Club in Thunder Bay to be its representative for the national women's playdowns. The team was chosen based on its position in the\u00a0Canadian Team Ranking System.\n\"I totally empathize with them, I think they're right that it does suck, that it isn't fair that they don't get the chance to play,\" said NOCA executive director Bobby Ray.\n\"But at the same time, I think we're facing a health situation that's a little bit out of our hands. It's absolutely not the decision that anybody wanted to make, but it's the one we're the most comfortable with.\"\u00a0\nRay said the concern was if one or two teams contracted COVID-19 while at the event\u00a0it would also result in an unfair competition, as those teams would be unable to complete their games.\nScotties Tournament of Hearts still a go, despite cancellation of some regional qualifiers\nScotties Tournament of Hearts ticket sales suspended due to new COVID-19 restrictions\nThe decision, he said, was about safety, even though he understands players are frustrated.\nEven though the playdowns were cancelled in late December, the event\u00a0would not be allowed to proceed based on current provincial regulations.\nDylan Johnson, who was the skip of\u00a0a team based out of the Fort Frances Curling Club for the men's draw, said while not playing is frustrating, it also has a financial cost.\nHe said the teams had to agree to bubble-type rules before the event would begin, which would mean essentially staying in hotel rooms, only ordering take-out, avoiding public spaces, and going immediately to and from the arena for games.\nMost teams agreed to the rules, he said, but even with that, the event was still cancelled.\n\"We put in practice time, we did some tournaments, as much as we could due to the COVID circumstances, we put a lot of money into it,\" Johnson said, noting the team is still trying to get a refund for its accommodations.\n\"We all booked time off work, I'm sure we can go back to work this week, but some people can't.\"",

        "content": "It's official \u2014 Team Galusha will be representing the N.W.T. at the 2022 Scotties Tournament of Hearts.\u00a0\nKerry Galusha, along with teammates Jo-Ann Rizzo, Margot Flemming and Sarah Koltun, and coach Shona Barbour, are heading to Thunder Bay later this month to compete for the chance to represent Canada at the women's world curling championship.\u00a0\nAs her team prepared for the N.W.T. women's curling championship, scheduled to be held on Jan. 5 in Inuvik, Galusha was worried about more than just earning a spot in the Scotties.\nSome team members had recently traveled, and did not want to risk spreading COVID-19 by going into a small community. And if anybody got sick, would they even be able to field a full team?\n\"It was pretty stressful, trying to make sure no one was exposed,\" said Galusha.\nHowever, the day before the championship was scheduled to begin, the territorial government announced a slate of new public health orders. The restrictions on indoor sports and gatherings forced NWT Curling to cancel the tournament.\n\"Of course we did not wish for that to happen, but we also understand that with the rapid spread of the Omicron [variant], this was something the [government of the Northwest Territories]\u00a0had to enact to ensure that people are kept safe,\" said Janie Hobart, competition director for NWT Curling.\u00a0\nShe added that as last year's territorial champions, Team Galusha earned the chance to represent the N.W.T at the Scotties once again.\u00a0\nScotties Tournament of Hearts still a go, despite cancellation of some regional qualifiers\n\"As soon as the event was cancelled, we knew we were going \u2014 and it was a relief,\" said Galusha. \"Of course, our team was really happy. We're always excited to represent the North.\"\nGalusha first represented the N.W.T. as a skip at the 2001 Tournament of Hearts, and has led her team to the national stage dozens of times since.\n'Hefty goals'\nThis year, Galusha said the team has some \"hefty goals\" for the competition; right now, they have their eyes on the championship round.\u00a0\n\"We're excited,\" she said. \"We're competitors, and we have a couple of weeks to prepare.\"\nBut in 2022, that preparation looks quite different than normal. The same public health orders that scuttled the tournament in Inuvik have also closed the Yellowknife Curling Centre, where Team Galusha trains.\u00a0\nAnd though Galusha said this \"affects our training a lot,\" she added many other teams across the country are in the same boat, and is confident that her team will be ready to hit the ice in Thunder Bay at the end of the month.\u00a0\n\"There are a lot of things you can do to prepare,\" she said. \"It's not like, if you don't practice for a week, you lose all your curling ability. So we have to remember that and try not to panic about 'oh my gosh, we don't have ice, this is going to be a disaster.'\u00a0\n\"There's a lot of other things we can do.\"\nFor now, Team Galusha is focused on staying healthy, getting lots of sleep, working on mental preparation and studying videos from previous competitions.\u00a0\nTHE BUZZER\nCanada's Olympic curling battle is underway\nAnd even though this was not the path she and her teammates had expected to take to the Scotties this year, Galusha said they are delighted to be going.\n\"It's always an honour to represent the N.W.T., and it's really special to us,\" she said. \"We never take it for granted.\"",

        "summary": "Now that all of Canada's Olympic curling teams are finally set, CBC Sports' daily newsletter takes a look at the three tournaments.",
        "content": "This is an excerpt from The Buzzer, which is CBC Sports' daily email newsletter.\u00a0\nStay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here\n.\nCanada's Olympic curling teams are finally complete\nRocks start flying in Beijing in 20 days, but it took until this morning for Canada to announce its final entry. John Morris and Rachel Homan will defend the mixed doubles gold medal that Morris won in 2018 with former teammate Kaitlyn Lawes.\nHoman and Morris were among the 16 teams that were supposed to compete for Canada's spot in the Olympic tournament at the national mixed doubles trials in Manitoba before the event was cancelled last month. A Curling Canada-led committee spent the last few weeks deciding which duo to send to China, weighing factors including recent mixed-doubles performance along with international success in traditional curling. Another flashy pairing in the running was reigning Scotties champ Kerri Einarson and 2014 Olympic men's gold medallist Brad Jacobs. There was also considerable lobbying from players who devote themselves to mixed doubles and believe that should count.\nBut, in the end, talent won out. If the goal is to send the team with the highest ceiling, then the selection committee settled on the most obvious pick. Morris, 43, is a proven Olympic performer who won a men's gold medal as the third for Kevin Martin in 2010 before taking the mixed doubles title with Lawes in 2018. The 32-year-old Homan is one of the most successful curlers ever, with three Scotties titles and a world championship in her trophy case. And theirs is no shotgun partnership. Homan and Morris have played mixed doubles together since 2015. Morris turned to Lawes four years ago after Homan won the Canadian women's trials, which made her ineligible for Olympic mixed doubles because of the Curling Canada policy prohibiting anyone from competing in more than one curling event at the same Games.\nAs for Lawes, she's heading to Beijing too as a member of the Jennifer Jones-skipped rink that won the Canadian women's trials in November. Brad Gushue's team won the men's. In Gushue and Jones, Canada will have a former Olympic gold medallist at skip in both of the traditional curling tournaments in Beijing.\nNow that we finally know everyone who's playing for Canada, let's take a quick look at the three Olympic curling tournaments and what the Canadian teams are facing:\nMixed doubles\nFirst, let's appreciate the simplicity of the Olympic curling tournaments. All three events start with a 10-team round robin, and the top four advance to the semifinals. The semifinal winners play for gold. The semifinal losers play for bronze. No Page playoffs, no weird triple-knockout brackets to decipher. Easy.\nIn 2018, when mixed doubles made its Olympic debut with an eight-team event, Morris and Lawes were a wrecking ball. After losing their opener to Norway, they reeled off eight straight wins to take gold, including a 10-3 demolition of Switzerland in the final.\nThe silver-medal Swiss duo of Jenny Perret and Martin Rios are back for Beijing. So is the Norwegian pairing of Kristin Skaslien and Magnus Nedregotten, who were awarded bronze after the man on the Russian team that beat them failed a doping test. Besides Homan, the only other big-name skip involved in the mixed doubles tournament is Great Britain's Bruce Mouat, a two-time European men's champ who took silver at the men's worlds last year.\nA big storyline in Beijing will be Homan's attempt to redeem herself from a disastrous showing in the women's event in 2018. Her team went 4-5 and became the first Canadian rink to miss the playoffs at the Olympics.\nThe mixed doubles event gets underway Feb. 2 at 7:05 a.m. ET, and Homan and Morris play their first game that night at 8:05 p.m. ET vs. Great Britain. The semifinals are on the morning of Feb. 7 in Canadian time zones, and the gold-medal game is the next day at 7:05 a.m. ET.\nMen's\nCanada also flopped in this event in 2018, with Kevin Koe's team losing in the semifinals to eventual champion John Shuster of the U.S. and then getting upset by Switzerland in the bronze-medal game. Before these Games, no Canadian curling team had ever failed to win a medal. In Pyeongchang, both traditional teams did.\nFor Gushue, a lot has changed since he won his Olympic gold medal in Italy 16 years ago. Back then, he was a talented yet still somewhat raw youngster who threw fourth rocks but leaned on the legendary Russ Howard to call games from the second position (in the official Olympic records, Howard is listed as the skip). Now Gushue is all grown up \u2014 a 41-year-old father of two who's fully in command of his craft. He captured three Brier titles from 2017-20 and a world championship in '17. Gushue took care of business as the favourite at the Canadian trials in November, losing only one game en route to defeating Jacobs in the final.\nThe competition in Beijing will be tough. It includes Shuster, Mouat and five-time world champion Nik Edin of Sweden, who's looking for his first Olympic gold after taking bronze in 2014 and silver in '18. The tournament opens Feb. 8 at 7:05 a.m. ET, when Canada faces Denmark. The semis are the morning of Feb. 17 in Canadian time zones, and the gold-medal game is Feb. 18 at 1:05 a.m. ET.\nWomen's\nJennifer Jones is curling royalty\u00a0\u2014 the winner of a record-tying six Scotties, a two-time world champion and an Olympic gold medallist in 2014. But her victory at the Canadian trials was somewhat of a surprise. At 47, Jones was considered to be past her prime, and most observers rated her behind Homan, Einarson and the red-hot Tracy Fleury. Sure enough, Jones lost to all of them in the round robin. But when the chips were down she came through, trouncing Krista McCarville in the semis before stealing the final from an undefeated Fleury in an extra end.\nIn Beijing, Jones will be up against all three medallists from 2018: defending champ Anna Hasselborg of Sweden, South Korea's Kim Eun-jung (silver) and Japan's Satsuki Fujisawa (bronze). There's also the winner of the last two world championships\u00a0\u2014 Switzerland's Silvana Tirinzoni\u00a0\u2014 and 2013 world champ Eve Muirhead of Great Britain, who took Olympic bronze in 2014.\nThe women's tournament starts Feb. 9 at 8:05 p.m. ET, and Canada plays its first game Feb. 10 at 7:05 a.m. ET vs. South Korea. The semifinals go in the morning of Feb. 18 in Canadian time zones, and the final is Feb. 19 at 8:05 p.m. ET.\nRead more about today's mixed doubles team announcement in\u00a0\nthis story\n\u00a0by CBC Sports' Devin Heroux. Devin and co-host Colleen Jones (the other six-time Scotties winner) will be joined by Jones, Gushue, Homan and Morris on tonight's episode of\u00a0\nThat Curling Show\n.

The highest-ranking woman in an NFL personnel department, Raiche has been with the Eagles since 2019 and was promoted to her current role last year. Before that, she worked for the CFL's Toronto Argonauts and Montreal Alouettes, where she was the team's assistant GM. Only one woman has been an NFL GM.\u00a0\nSusan Tose Spencer\n\u00a0was appointed by then Eagles owner Leonard Tose, her father, in 1983.\u00a0\nRead more about Raiche's potential interview with Minnesota here\n.\nNovak Djokovic learned his opponent for the first round of the Australian Open \u2014\u00a0if he's allowed to play.\n\u00a0The men's No. 1 will face unseeded fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic on Monday or Tuesday, assuming Australia's immigration minister doesn't exercise his power to deport Djokovic for failing to comply with the country's COVID-19 vaccination requirement for foreign visitors. A final decision on that has still not been announced. The highest-seeded Canadian singles player, men's No. 9 Felix Auger-Aliassime, drew Finland's unseeded Emil Ruusuvuori. No. 14 Denis Shapovalov, who along with Auger-Aliassime helped Canada win its first ATP Cup title last weekend, will face unseeded Serb Laslo Djere. Women's No. 23 Leylah Fernandez looks to build on her surprising run to the U.S. Open final last year as she meets Australian wild card Maddison Inglis.

I think every competitor wanted to have a chance to win and compete, so\u00a0that was unfortunate,\" Morris said.\n\"This isn't how you draw it up but whenever you have the chance to put that maple leaf on and go to the Olympics and represent your country, you're getting called to duty and it's one of the best calls in the world. It's an honour and a privilege.\"\nHoman and Morris have been a mixed doubles team since 2015 and have been a successful duo over the years. When Homan won the right to compete for Canada in 2018 in\u00a0Pyeongchang with her team, Morris had to find a new partner\u00a0\u2014 he teamed up with Lawes and the two immediately found chemistry and won gold.\nBeijing Bound\nAthletes named to Canada's Beijing Olympic team\nCBC announces programming details, broadcast team for 2022 Winter Olympics\nHoman says despite the small timeframe to prepare for the Olympics, she's confident her and Morris will be ready for competition.\n\"We both have tremendous respect for each other. Both of us know the pressure. We've been there before and at different levels we've succeeded and have come up short. We're taking all of our experiences into this,\" she said.\nMorris says their bond goes way back, as early as when Homan was a baby and they were growing up in the Ottawa Valley.\n\"I used to play with Rachel's brother in Little Rocks. We played out of the RCMP Curling Club and Rachel was a rink rat around there. We were 10\u00a0or 12 years old. Rachel was running around and didn't want anything to do with a curling rink back then,\" Morris said.\n\"I think she was one or two when I met her and we've been family friends ever since.\"\nCanada begins the mixed doubles Olympic curling competition on Feb. 3.\nTheir first game is against Great Britain, composed of defending mixed doubles world champions Jennifer Dodds and Bruce Mouat.",

On an average per year basis, it makes Jackson the NFL\u2019s new highest-paid player.\n&mdash;\n@AdamSchefter\nThe deal keeps the 2019 NFL MVP in Baltimore for the foreseeable future and ends a contract negotiation saga that was dominating the team's off-season.

Five years ago, he wasn't one of the top players taken.\nPanthers select Alabama quarterback Bryce Young with top pick of 2023 NFL draft\nTHE BUZZER\nA record number of Canadians could get picked in the NFL draft\nBaltimore landed him with the 32nd pick, and he was the fifth quarterback chosen. Of the four who went ahead of him, only Buffalo's Josh Allen has enjoyed success comparable to Jackson. Allen signed a long-term deal with the Bills two off-seasons ago.\nJackson's deal brought one of the NFL's biggest off-season stories to a conclusion \u2014 right as one of the league's biggest annual events was about to start. The Ravens can now expect Jackson in the lineup for the first game of the season, without drama about whether he'll report to camp. They've already boosted his wide receiving group by signing Odell Beckham Jr. Baltimore also has a new offensive coordinator after hiring Georgia's Todd Monken.\nRavens agree to 1-year deal with Odell Beckham Jr.\nJackson is already one of six quarterbacks in NFL history with 10,000 yards passing and 4,000 rushing. He's been hurt at the end of the past two seasons, however. At age 26, his best days could well be ahead of him, and now he'll remain in a Baltimore uniform.\nJackson, who was negotiating without an agent, stood to make $32.4 million this season if he played on the franchise tag, but that path had potential pitfalls for both sides. Jackson would have risked losing a lot of money long term if he was injured, and even if he stayed healthy, the team might have had an unhappy quarterback on its hands. Jackson's contract situation didn't seem too disruptive last offs-eason, but it took a different turn when he announced in late March that he'd requested a trade a few weeks earlier.\nWhether that was out of frustration with the process or an attempt to draw more interest from other teams, Jackson and the Ravens now appear to be very much on the same page.",

Totals for Homan and Duncan remained unchanged after the cancellation of the Ontario event.\n\"Seems like a good year to have three wild-card teams at the Scotties [and]\u00a0Brier to be fair,\" tweeted Wayne Middaugh, who skipped for an injured Glenn Howard on the 'Wild Card Three' team at last year's Brier.\nWith the Scotties set to begin Jan. 26 and Olympic play to kick off Feb. 2, the clock is ticking.\nWhen asked about the wild-card situation and whether changes might be considered, a Curling Canada spokesman said via email the subject was \"being sorted out today\" and an update would be forthcoming.\nCarey, reached Monday afternoon in Regina, said she'd like to see multiple wild-card teams in the field.\n\"I don't agree with it being only two teams because of provincials and the way everything went down,\" she told The Canadian Press. \"I think it should be what they did last year.\"\nThe wild-card format, which replaced the unpopular four-team qualification system, was first used in 2018.\n'It would be unethical...'\nThe two highest-ranked teams not already qualified through provincial/territorial playdowns meet in a loser-goes-home showdown.\n\"It would be unethical to alter the rules after the fact [now]\u00a0for who is in that wild-card game,\" veteran skip Mike McEwen said on Twitter. \"But I'm not saying the rules/formats are fair given circumstances teams/provinces face. Reinstating 3 Wild Cards at women's and men's nationals is the most equitable solution.\"\nAny potential change would require a new draw. The Scotties play-in game team entries remained vacant on the competition website Monday and the Canadian Team Ranking System (CTRS) standings were not updated.\nHowever, the Canadian rankings \u2014 complete with updates from weekend play \u2014 were available Monday on the World Curling Federation website.\nThey showed that Carey earned 21.175 points by making the Saskatchewan final. Since the top five competitions this season were used, her total (127.058) moved her just ahead of Homan (125.031) and Duncan (116.056).\nTHE BUZZER\nHow many medals will Canada win at the Winter Olympics?\nLong wait continues for Team Rachel Homan with new wrinkle after Ontario decision\nLaura Walker makes game-winning draw to win Alberta playdown, book Scotties ticket\n\"CTRS points cannot be awarded in provincials that were played and none awarded for ones that were cancelled due to COVID. That's the tweet,\" Ryan Fry, who plays third on Team John Epping, said on Twitter.\nCarey, a two-time Scotties champion, dropped a 7-5 decision to Penny Barker in the Saskatchewan final on Sunday.\n\"Yes we got to play provincials \u2014 quote, unquote \u2014 but we had to worry about COVID the whole time,\" Carey said. \"I don't know, I'm not sure that that's better. We probably would have been Team Saskatchewan \u2014 we were the No. 1 seed in the provincials \u2014 so if we didn't play, we probably would have got named as the team.\n\"So I'm not even sure that it's better that we got to play. Everything is just a mess right now unfortunately.\"\nHoman, meanwhile, has been provisionally named to represent Ontario. CurlON also decided that if she's named to the Olympic mixed doubles team with John Morris, that Duncan would go to nationals instead.\nContingency plans\nPart of the reason for Curling Canada's delay in naming the duo \u2014 the 16-team trials were cancelled Dec. 26 \u2014 can likely be chalked up to determining what might happen in the event of any COVID-19 wrenches over the next few weeks.\n\"Every contingency plan has a contingency plan behind it,\" a Curling Canada spokesman said, declining to go into detail.\nTHAT CURLING SHOW | Wayne,\u00a0Kim Tuck discuss mixed doubles curling program:\nWayne and Kim Tuck criticize Canada's mixed doubles curling program\n2 years ago\nDuration \n2:12\nThe married curling duo say that Canada needs proper infrastructure to build a standalone mixed doubles program, separate from team curling.\nAs for the wild-card format, the three-team setup was generally considered a hit at last year's national playdowns in the Calgary bubble.\nCurling Canada said it made the change last year to ensure the \"quality and integrity of the championships\" when many teams did not have the opportunity to play down for berths due to the pandemic.\nThe schedule was essentially back to normal this season before the arrival of the Omicron variant. Many teams have been limited of late depending on cancellations and pandemic-related restrictions, which vary across the country.\nAbout half the players confirmed for the Scotties were acclaimed for their spots.\nHoman's four-player team earned over half of its points this season with solid showings at two Grand Slam events. A last-place finish at the Olympic trials in November proved costly.\nTeam Jennifer Jones won the trials and will represent Canada in Beijing. Team Brad Gushue won the men's team berth.\nThe Brier is scheduled for March 4-13 in Lethbridge, Alta.",

        "content": "After six weeks of waiting, Aaron Rodgers is leaving behind his brilliant legacy in Green Bay and heading to the bright lights \u2014 and massive expectations \u2014 of the Big Apple.\nThe New York Jets agreed on a deal Monday to acquire the four-time NFL MVP from the Packers.\nPackers general manager Brian Gutekunst said at a predraft news conference that the deal hasn't been finalized, but should be completed before the draft begins Thursday.\n\"We were expecting it to be done very quickly, hopefully soon,\" Gutekunst said. \"A lot of things have been agreed upon. Some things to go through.\"\nPLAYER STATS: Aaron Rodgers\nTEAM PAGE: New York Jets\nThe Jets will receive Rodgers, the No. 15 overall pick and a fifth-rounder this year from the Packers, according to another person with knowledge of the trade. In exchange, Green Bay will get the 13th overall selection, a second-rounder (No. 42) and a sixth-rounder this year and a conditional 2024 second-round pick that can become a first-rounder if Rodgers plays 65 per cent\u00a0of plays for New York next season.\nESPN first reported the agreement on terms between the teams on a deal.\nThe 39-year-old Rodgers spent a few days in February contemplating his life and playing future during an isolation retreat in Oregon \u2014 while fans and media speculated about what he would decide.\nHe emerged and deliberated some more before deciding on March 10 he intended to play again \u2014 and for the Jets. Rodgers made his intentions official during an appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" on YouTube and Sirius XM on March 15. That came after New York had sent a contingent that included owner Woody Johnson, coach Robert Saleh and general manager Joe Douglas to Rodgers' home in Southern California in early March.\nAnd then he and the sports world waited \u2014 and waited \u2014 for the Packers and Jets to finally complete a deal.\n\"We've been working on this for a while,\" Gutekunst said. \"To get beyond the draft I think would have been tough for both teams.\"\nThe 39-year-old Aaron Rodgers now will be tasked with leading a franchise that hasn't been in the Super Bowl since Joe Namath led the franchise to a victory in its only appearance in January 1969.\n \n(Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports via Reuters)\nSeveral weeks of negotiations appeared to be stalled at times, with fans \u2014 and the teams \u2014 wondering when or if the trade would be completed.\n\"We're anxious,\" Johnson told reporters at the league's annual meetings on March 28. \"I guess, as we look forward, we're optimistic. But we have a plan, so we're willing to stick with our plan. And I don't think anybody is hyperventilating at this point.\"\nIt took a while, but the sides were finally able to agree on compensation. And the deal puts the one-time Super Bowl champion in New York after Zach Wilson, the No. 2 overall draft pick in 2021, struggled mightily in his first two seasons.\nNew York was 7-10 last season, finishing on a six-game losing streak that extended the NFL's longest active playoff drought to a franchise-record 12 straight years.\nReunions\nWith the Jets, Rodgers reunites with offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett to try to jumpstart an offence that was among the NFL's worst under coordinator Mike LaFleur, the younger brother of Matt, Rodgers' coach in Green Bay the past four years. Rodgers joins some promising young playmakers on offence, such as wide receiver Garrett Wilson, the AP offensive rookie of the year, and running back Breece Hall.\n\"There's a lot of reasons why the Jets are attractive,\" Rodgers said during his appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"But there's one coach that has meant as much to me as any coach I've ever had. And he happens to be the coordinator there.\"\nSaleh acknowledged a few times this offseason that the Jets were looking for a veteran quarterback to add to a team that features a top-five defence. And Johnson said he was \"absolutely\" on board with paying an established signal caller \u2014 \"the missing piece,\" he called it \u2014 if Douglas could get him.\nThey ended up getting one of the NFL's greatest quarterbacks.\nPackers' Aaron Rodgers, Canadian partner Ben Silverman win pro-am at Pebble Beach\nBills safety Damar Hamlin cleared to play after cardiac arrest, GM says\nRodgers said shortly after the season ended that he was making up his mind on whether he wanted to return to the Packers for a 19th season, retire or request a trade. Meanwhile, the Jets explored a few quarterback options, including meeting with free agent Derek Carr at their facility and then again at the NFL combine in Indianapolis.\nBut after Carr agreed to terms to sign with New Orleans, it became even more apparent that New York would be all in on Rodgers \u2014 as long as he wanted to play there.\nIt's reminiscent of the stunning trade the Jets made in 2008, when they acquired Brett Favre \u2014 who also turned 39 a few months later \u2014 from the Packers. And, coincidentally, clearing the way for Rodgers to start in Green Bay.\nRodgers was the league MVP in 2020 and 2021, but didn't perform as well last season while playing with a broken right thumb and dealing with the absence of star wideout Davante Adams, who was traded to Las Vegas. He had his lowest passer rating as a starter (91.1) and threw 12 interceptions, his highest total since 2008. The Packers went 8-9 and missed the playoffs to end a string of three straight NFC North titles.\n2010\u00a0Super Bowl title, no follow-ups\nRodgers led the Packers to their last Super Bowl title in the 2010 season. Rodgers never got the Packers back to the Super Bowl, but he helped make them annual contenders. The Packers have lost in the NFC championship game four of the last nine seasons.\n\"I've got nothing but love and appreciation for what Aaron has done for so many in our organization,\" Matt LaFleur said last month during the NFL meetings in Phoenix.\nRodgers' departure marks a sea of change for the Packers after they've had about three decades of Hall of Fame-level quarterback production in Favre and Rodgers. Next in line is Jordan Love, a 2020 first-round pick who has made only one career start.\nRodgers acknowledged the move caught him by surprise. He skipped the Packers' 2021 mandatory minicamp in a standoff with team management before reporting to camp and producing a second straight MVP season. (He also won the award for 2011 and 2014.) But the sides had patched things up afterward.\nWhen he was asked last June at the Packers' mandatory minicamp whether he expected to finish his career in Green Bay, Rodgers replied: \"Yes. Definitely.\"\nThen came a 2022 season that didn't go according to plan.\nNFL's Washington Commanders reportedly sold for record $6.05 billion US\nMore NFL coverage\nRodgers now will be tasked with leading a franchise that hasn't been in the Super Bowl since Joe Namath led the franchise to a victory in its only appearance in January 1969.\nAnd quarterback issues have often been among the key culprits in the struggles since. That has especially been the case during the Jets' current playoff drought.\nSaleh said the Jets remain committed to developing Wilson, the second overall pick in 2021. But the 23-year-old will do so as a backup to Rodgers, who was Wilson's idol while growing up in Utah.\nWilson joked the day after the season ended that he'd welcome a veteran starter coming in to claim his job and said he plans to \"make that dude's life hell in practice every day.\"\nLittle did he know then \"that dude\" would be the quarterback he tried to emulate as a youngster \u2014 who'll now be in New York trying bring the Jets to another long-awaited Super Bowl.",

Tucker also became the first player in school history to record consecutive 1,000-yard seasons as well as 250-plus receiving yards.\nBergeron was invited to both the Senior Bowl and NFL combine during the off-season. He was the second offensive lineman selected in the second round but first tackle.\nFive tackles were selected Thursday.\n\"I've been playing football my whole life and now it's my job and I'm excited to attack it,\" Bergeron said. \"Obviously football is my passion and for your passion to be your job, I think is kind of a dream come true.\"\nWhen asked what kind of player the Falcons selected, Bergeron's answer was short and sweet: \"A physical and aggressive player.\"\nVictoriaville, Que., native Matthew Bergeron speaks to media at the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis in March.\n \n(Michael Hickey/Getty Images)\nBergeron made 39 career starts at tackle at Syracuse and was the top-ranked player in the CFL's spring scouting bureau of the top-20 prospects for Tuesday's draft. Bergeron became the first freshman to start at tackle for the Orange in nearly 20 years.\nHe came into the NFL draft as the top Canadian prospect, garnering a grade as an eventual plus starter. Bergeron had a 30.5-inch vertical leap and eight-foot-seven broad jump at the NFL combine and ended up ranked eighth among offensive tackles there.\nThe scouting report on Bergeron said while he was a college tackle, he could end up being a guard in the NFL. Scouts felt he was evenly proportioned and wore his weight well and many were impressed with his run-blocking (which had been described as Pro Bowl-calibre) and his ability to excel in positioning, sustaining and then finishing.\nThe Falcons would appear set at tackle with Kaleb McGary (a 2019 first-round pick) on the right side and veteran Jake Matthews (entering his 10th NFL season) at left tackle. The team has a Pro Bowl player at right guard in Chris Lindstrom but there's a vacancy at left guard with Elijah Wilkinson, who started nine games there last season, joining the Arizona Cardinals as a free agent.\n\"He's someone the more I watched, I started to like him more,\" Daniel Jeremiah, the NFL Network's draft guru, said during the network's telecast Friday. \"I thought this guy had a chance to hold up at tackle [but]\u00a0immediately I talked to a couple of teams [that said], 'He's going to have to kick inside.'\n\"I think he can play tackle in a pinch\u00a0he plays with really good balance. You rarely find him out of position.\"\nRavens make QB Lamar Jackson highest-paid player in NFL history with 5-year, $260M US deal: reports\nNFL suspends 5 players for violating the league's gambling policy\nNFL Network's Charles Davis said he could understand the rationale for moving Bergeron to guard.\n\"I thought he was a tackle when we watched him at the Senior Bowl with his movement skills and how he got out on plays,\" he said. \"But I see where moving him inside to guard works.\"\nAtlanta (7-10) finished tied for second in the NFC South behind the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9), missing the NFL playoffs.\nBergeron also received solid grades for his athleticism but there were concerns his ability to consistently anchor as well as with his hand placement. Scouts also cited some inconsistent footwork while getting into his pass sets and that Bergeron sometimes gives up too much ground while being bull-rushed by defensive linemen.\nSydney Brown joins Eagles\nThe five-foot-10, 211-pound Brown was a first-team All-Big Ten coaches selection last season at Illinois. The 23-year-old Canadian started 12 games, registering 59 tackles (3.5 for loss), six interceptions (tied for third in FBS) with a sack and scored two defensive TDs in the regular-season finale at Northwestern.\nBrown also garnered USA Today all-American and All-Big Ten (media) second-team honours and was a PFF all-American third-team selection.

Robinson, who began his college football career at Guelph, is the first Gryphons player ever drafted south of the border, which he said is significant.\n\"It shows all the kids back home and up here it's possible with hard work and dedication,\" Robinson said during a Ravens video conference. \"It's important kids know that and so I'm definitely grateful for the opportunity and happy kids can look up to me, for sure.\n\"There are so many great players up here who, in my mind if they were in D1 schools they'd be in the same position, but it's hard to get that opportunity in Canada. It's great to see and I think it will continue to open up more opportunities for Canadian kids . . . I think the numbers are going to rise and rise every year.\"\nFalcons trade up to pick Canadian offensive lineman Matthew Bergeron in NFL draft\nPittsburgh receiver Jared Wayne announced on social media that he had signed as an undrafted free agent with the Houston Texans. The six-foot-three, 210-pound Wayne declared for this year's draft after registering 60 receptions for 1,062 yards and five TDs in 2022.\nWayne finished his collegiate career with 146 catches for 2,308 yards and 13 touchdowns.\nThe six-foot-four, 329-pound Sow started 13 games last season, allowing just two sacks in 949 snaps. He helped the Eagles finish first in the MAC in red-zone offence (93.9 per cent) and third-down percentage (44.9), and second in passing efficiency (137.9).\nDaniel Jeremiah, NFL Network's draft guru, feels the Patriots selected a future starter in Sow.\n\"Torque and power, that's what his game is all about,\" Jeremiah said during the network's draft telecast. \"Excellent on combo blocks.\n\"He'll give up his chest a little bit in pass protection but he can anchor down. He's going to be a starter. A really good football player.\"\nFrom left: Offensive lineman Sidy Sow and defensive end Tavius Robinson made it four Canadian players chosen by NFL teams, tying the mark for the most-ever picked in a single draft. \n \n(CBC Sports composite: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports via Reuters and Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\nSow was an All-MAC first-team selection in 2022 after being named a third-team player in 2021. He started 11-of-13 games at left tackle as a true freshman in 2018 before moving to left guard in 2019.\nAfter being named a third-team MAC selection in 2020, Sow was a first-team pick in 2021 and 2022. Sow finished his collegiate career as Eastern Michigan's all-time leader in games played (56) and started (54).\nSow participated in the '23 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl and NFL combine.

He recorded 44 tackles (17 solo), seven sacks, five forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries.\nBaltimore selected Robinson as an outside linebacker.\n\"He did a nice job at Ole Miss,\" Jeremiah said of Robinson. \"The more you saw, the more you saw him improve.\n\"He's long, he launches out of his four-point stance.

At Guelph, he recorded 65 tackles and 13.5 sacks and was named to the 2018 OUA all-rookie squad before earning a '19 second-team all-star selection.\n\"My two years in Canada and first year at Ole Miss I was a standup defensive end,\" Robinson said. \"I'm very comfortable with both.\n\"I just feel like I have so much more room to grow. I'm a sponge, I like to be coached, I like to become the best I can at this game. I think there's a lot of room to grow, for sure.\"\nMore NFL coverage\nRobinson said his penchant for forcing turnovers didn't come by accident.\n\"The ball wins games so whenever you get a shot to take that ball out it's what you have to do,\" he said. \"A sack isn't enough, you've got to get the strip sack.\n\"That's kind of my mentality.\"\nRobinson participated in both the '23 Senior Bowl and NFL combine. At Indianapolis, he covered the 40-yard dash in 4.66 seconds and registered a 33.5-inch vertical leap, 10-foot broad jump and 23 reps in the 225-pound bench press.\nRobinson said while he spoke with Ravens officials at both the Senior Bowl and combine, he wasn't sure if he was still on their radar.\n\"I didn't know 100 per cent if it was going to end up [that way],\" Robinson said. \"When I got the call and saw it was Baltimore, I was excited right away to be part of such a great program.\n\"I'm excited to get there and start work and do everything I can to help win Super Bowls in Baltimore.

Stroud and Anthony Richardson were among the top four picks Thursday night, an expected result in a rich draft class that's been anticipated since last year. The surprise in the first round was that Will Levis didn't hear his name called.\nYoung, the slender and dynamic Alabama quarterback, went No. 1 to the Carolina Panthers, seven weeks after the team made a blockbuster trade with Chicago to move up to get their choice.\nThe biggest question surrounding the 2021 Heisman Trophy winner is size. He measured at 5-foot-10 1/8 and weighed 204 pounds at the combine. Though he dominated the SEC, some scouts and coaches fear Young may not be able to physically withstand all the hits in the NFL.\n\"Those that doubt me are entitled to their opinion,\" Young said. \"I think that is the beauty of sports. We all come together and have arguments on who you think is good or not. I choose to focus on what I can control.\"\n\"You're our guy.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/QxLiktPtSm\">pic.twitter.com/QxLiktPtSm</a>\n&mdash;\n@Panthers\nStroud didn't have to wait long despite speculation he may drop out of the top 10 after scoring poorly in the S2 Cognition test. He told the AP earlier in the day he didn't know where he would end up going but Houston snagged him at No. 2. The Texans then made a blockbuster deal with Arizona to acquire the No. 3 pick and selected Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson Jr.\n\"I can't wait to play with Will,\" Stroud said. \"I hope he doesn't hit me too hard in practice.\"\nRichardson was selected at No. 4 by the Indianapolis Colts, who will begin a sixth straight season with a different starting QB.\nRichardson might have the most upside of the group but he has the least experience. He threw just 393 passes at Florida. Colts owner Jim Irsay is fond of Philadelphia Eagles QB Jalen Hurts and Richardson has similar playmaking ability.\nTHE BUZZER\nA record number of Canadians could get picked in the NFL draft\nPanthers acquire No. 1 pick of 2023 draft from Bears in deal involving WR D.J. Moore\nHe'll play for Shane Steichen, who was the offensive coordinator in Philadelphia when Hurts developed into an MVP runner-up.\n\"I know what he did with Hurts but I am excited to get to work with him,\" Richardson said. \"He has told me we are going to do great things so I am looking forward to it.\"\nLevis, Hooker slide to day two\nHeading into the draft, there was no certainty beyond the No. 1 pick and even that wasn't a lock. Some thought Kentucky's Levis would be the second QB taken but he slipped out of the first round. Tennessee's Hendon Hooker, who is coming off ACL surgery, also wasn't taken on the first day.\nNew Panthers coach Frank Reich said earlier in the week that the organization only reached a consensus Monday after several weeks of deliberation.\n\"I learned so much in my short time there,\" Young said of his visit with the Panthers. \"It is an amazing staff. You can tell there is an energy, focus, drive and will to win.\"\nA dual-threat playmaker with a strong arm and an elite combination of instincts and intelligence, Young also possesses the intangibles and characteristics coaches desire, including leadership ability and a strong work ethic.\nJets agree on deal to acquire 4-time MVP Aaron Rodgers from Packers\nNFL suspends 5 players for violating the league's gambling policy\nThe Panthers have sought an answer at quarterback since moving on from Cam Newton, who was the No. 1 overall pick in 2011 and the NFL MVP in 2015 when he led the Panthers to a 15-1 record and a Super Bowl appearance.\nYoung had a spectacular career at Alabama and the Panthers are hoping he can deliver the franchise's first Lombardi Trophy. He played in a pro-style offence under offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien, the former Texans head coach who has returned to the NFL to run New England's offence.\nStroud, a finalist for the Heisman Trophy the past two seasons at Ohio State, goes to Houston to help the rebuilding Texans move past Deshaun Watson. It's the ninth time two QBs went 1-2 and the first time it was two Black QBs.\n\"I hope that inspired a lot of Black children,\" Stroud said.\nYour #2 and #3 overall pick checking in! <a href=\"https://t.co/PSag1yHob5\">pic.twitter.com/PSag1yHob5</a>\n&mdash;\n@HoustonTexans\nAfter the run on QBs, defence-needy Seattle took Illinois cornerback Devon Witherspoon at No. 5 and the wheeling-and-dealing Cardinals moved up to No. 6 to select Ohio State offensive lineman Paris Johnson. Las Vegas then chose Texas Tech edge Tyree Wilson and Atlanta made Bijan Robinson the first running back taken in the top 10 since Saquon Barkley went No. 2 to the Giants in 2018.\nNFC champion Eagles bag a bargain\nNFC champion Philadelphia moved up one spot to take troubled Georgia defensive tackle Jalen Carter at No. 9 and Chicago went with Tennessee offensive lineman Darnell Wright with the 10th pick. The Eagles got Carter's teammate, edge Nolan Smith, at No. 30.\nAt No. 11, the Titans passed on Levis for Northwestern offensive lineman Peter Skoronski. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers also passed on Levis at No. 19, taking Pitt defensive tackle Calijah Kancey.\nIt took until the 20th pick for the first wide receiver to go. The Seahawks chose Jaxon Smith-Njigba. That started a run of four wideouts in a row. The Chargers then took Quentin Johnston, the Ravens grabbed Zay Flowers to team up with Odell Beckham Jr., and the Vikings added Jordan Addison to go with Justin Jefferson.\nTwo months after the hometown Kansas City Chiefs celebrated another Super Bowl title with a downtown parade, a sea of red-clad fans lined up in the streets where the century-old Union Station served as the backdrop for the draft.\nSuper Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes and All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce walked on stage with the Vince Lombardi Trophy and riled up the crowd before turning it over to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\nMahomes implored fans to scream louder \u2014 they did. Kelce asked if they wanted to trade up for the No. 1 pick.\nBut the Chiefs don't need a QB. Carolina, Houston and Indianapolis did.\nIf they got the right one, they might be set for a decade or longer.",

        "content": "Joe Kapp was larger than life, on and off the football field.\nThe fiery quarterback led the B.C. Lions to their first Grey Cup title, then made global headlines more than 45 years later when he came to blows with fellow Hall of Famer Angelo Mosca. Kapp died Monday night at the age of 85.\nThe Lions confirmed Kapp's passing. The cause of death wasn't immediately divulged but Kapp told the San Jose Mercury News in 2016 he had Alzheimer's disease and was donating his brain for concussion research.\nThere were reports he also battled dementia for over a decade.\n\"Joe Kapp will go down as one of the all-time great players for not only our franchise but the entire Canadian Football League,\" Neil McEvoy, the Lions co-general manager/director of football operations, said in a statement. \"Along with helping put the Lions on the map after some lean early years, Joe also served as a trailblazer for quarterbacks making a name for themselves on both sides of the border.\n\"Our thoughts are with Joe's wife Jennifer and the entire family at this time.\"\nThe six-foot-two, 215-pound Kapp played eight CFL seasons with the Calgary Stampeders (1959-60) and B.C. (1961-1966) before also serving as the Lions GM (1990). He completed 1,476 of 2,709 passes (54.5 per cent) in Canada for 22,725 yards with 136 touchdowns\u00a0and 129 interceptions.\n \nWhile most quarterbacks tried to evade defenders, he would run over them.\n\u2014 CFL commisssioner\u00a0Randy Ambrosie on former QB Joe Kapp\nKapp, a native of Santa Fe, New Mexico, also ran for 2,784 yards on 579 carries (4.8-yard average) and five TDs. Kapp led B.C. to a Grey Cup appearance in 1963 and the franchise's first league title the following season.\nBolted to NFL after '66 season\nKapp was definitely a throwback in Canada as instead of avoiding contact, Kapp seemingly went looking for it. And when he found it, rather than run out of bounds the rugged Kapp would lower his shoulder and try to run over or through a defensive player.\n\"Joe Kapp was tough as nails,\" CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said in a statement. \"While most quarterbacks tried to evade defenders, he would run over them.\n\"Kapp, in his playing days, epitomized a brash, young league making its mark in the sports world.\"\nKapp went to the NFL after the '66 season, playing for both Minnesota (1967-69) and the Boston Patriots (1970). Kapp signed with the Vikings in a deal that allowed Canadian receiver Jim Young, a future Canadian Football Hall of Famer, to join the Lions.\nKapp led the Vikings to the Super Bowl in 1969 where they lost 23-7 to the Kansas City Chiefs.\nKapp, Mosca regretting CFL luncheon brawl\nCFL greats' fight 'most bizarre thing'\nThe Vikings GM at the time was none other than Jim Finks, who had brought Kapp to Canada with the Calgary Stampeders. Minnesota's head coach was the late Bud Grant, the former Winnipeg Blue Bombers head coach whose teams had faced Kapp in Canada.\nKapp, a two-time CFL all-star, is the only quarterback to play in the Rose Bowl, Grey Cup and Super Bowl.\nKapp was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1984 and named to the U.S. college football Hall of Fame in 2004. Kapp is also a member of the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and B.C. Lions Wall of Fame.\nHis No. 22 has been retired by the Lions.\nKapp played his collegiate football at the University of California, Berkeley, leading the school to a Pacific Coast championship in 1958. On Jan. 1, 1959, the Golden Bears lost a 38-12 decision to Iowa in the Rose Bowl.\nDidn't hear from Washington\nKapp was a two-sport star at Cal. He also played basketball on the school's Pacific Coast Conference championship teams (1956-57, 1957-58).\nWashington selected Kapp in the 18th round of the 1959 NFL draft. But after the franchise failed to contact Kapp, he accepted an offer from Finks, then the Stampeders GM.\nKapp spent two seasons in Calgary before being dealt to the B.C. Lions. The move came after Kapp suffered a bad knee injury early during the 1960 season but didn't miss any games as he played with it heavily taped.\nKapp led B.C. to a 12-4 record and top spot in the West Division standings in 1963. The Lions dispatched the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the conference final to advance to the Grey Cup game versus the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Vancouver's Empire Stadium.\nHamilton won 21-10 but the game is remembered for Mosca's controversial blow on Lions running back Willie Fleming. Mosca's sideline hit on Fleming while Fleming was on the ground touched off a long-standing feud between players on both teams.\nTiger-Cats legend Angelo Mosca dies at 84 after lengthy battle with Alzheimer's\nThe Lions avenged the Grey Cup loss the following season. After posting a stellar 11-2-3 record, B.C., dispatched Hamilton 36-24 in the Grey Cup game, the first title in franchise history.\nBut the bad blood never dissipated. In 2011, Kapp and Mosca had a physical altercation during a CFL Alumni Association luncheon in Vancouver.\nVideo of Kapp shoving flowers in Mosca's face, Mosca retaliating by swinging his cane at Kapp, who then punched Mosca, knocking him to the floor grabbed global attention.\nWATCH | Longtime CFL rivals come to blows years later:\nCFL greats duke it out\n12 years ago\nDuration \n4:06\nComedian Ron James recalls the odd dust-up that happened at a CFL luncheon he was hosting for league legends in Vancouver\nKapp left for the NFL following the 1966 season. But he returned to B.C. in 1990 as the club's general manager. While Kapp was responsible for recruiting former NFL star Mark Gastineau (who was a flop in the CFL), he did sign Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Doug Flutie.\nMore CFL coverage\nMore NFL coverage\nFlutie spent eight illustrious seasons in Canada (1990-97) with B.C., the Calgary Stampeders and Toronto Argonauts before joining the Buffalo Bills in 1998. The former Boston College star was the CFL's outstanding player an unprecedented six times and was a three-time Grey Cup champion.\nFlutie was voted as the CFL's top player all-time in a TSN poll in 2006 and two years later was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. Flutie is also a member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\nBefore serving as a Lions executive, Kapp coached at his alma mater (1982-86), posting a 20-34-1 record. The Golden Bears had a 7-4 mark in Kapp's first season, which included an improbable 25-20 victory over rival Stanford on a game-ending kickoff return TD dubbed \"The Play.\" It featured five separate laterals and the touchdown was scored with the Cardinal marching band on the field.\nKapp also worked as an actor in the 1970s-'80s, appearing in such TV programs as Ironside, The Six Million Dollar Man, Adam-12 and Police Woman. He also had roles in such movies as The Longest Yard, Semi-Tough, Breakheart Pass and The Frisco Kid.",

The meeting was attended by San Diego deputy district attorney Trisha Amador and the woman, as well as the woman's attorney, district attorney investigator Ted Mansour and a selected victim advocate.\nEx-Bills punter Matt Araiza won't be charged in alleged gang rape\nSDSU defends handling of Matt Araiza gang-rape allegation inquiry\nThe purpose of the meeting was largely for Amador to explain why criminal charges could not be filed and answer questions after the San Diego Police Department concluded its investigation in August 2022.\nAmador told the woman Araiza left the off-campus party about an hour before the time of the reported rape, according to a witness. Amador said Araiza is \"alleged to have left the party at 12:30\" and was not \"even at the party anymore\" when the alleged rape occurred at 1:30 a.m. Pacific, according to video time stamps of the encounter.\nAmador also told the woman that nobody outside of her office, including the witness who testified to Araiza's departure from the party, knows about the specific time stamps of the videos recovered from the party.\nThe Bills released Araiza in August, just days after the woman filed her lawsuit. The accuser alleged in the suit that Araiza, then 21, had sex with her in a side yard at an off-campus residence before bringing her into a bedroom where a group of men took turns raping her. She said she went in and out of consciousness as the men assaulted her for about 90 minutes.\nThe woman, who was 17 at the time, reported the alleged rape the following day to the San Diego Police Department, which investigated the allegations for nine months before turning over its investigation to prosecutors on Aug. 5, 2022.\nBills release punter Matt Araiza after gang rape allegation\nBills' investigation of punter Araiza didn't include alleged victim\nThe district attorney's office also was unable to prove that there was awareness of her age or her intoxication level.

        "content": "Ex-Las Vegas Raiders player Henry Ruggs told a judge Tuesday he will admit that he drove drunk at speeds up to 156 mph (approximately 251 kilometres per hour), causing a fiery crash that killed a woman. His plea deal is expected to send the 24-year-old first-round NFL draft pick to state prison for three to 10 years.\nRuggs waived a long-delayed preliminary hearing with the agreement to admit that he drove under the influence of alcohol causing death, a felony, his lawyers said. A six-month sentence for a guilty plea to misdemeanor manslaughter will be folded in with the total.\nRuggs spoke only to acknowledge for Justice of the Peace Harmony Letizia that he understands the terms of the agreement. The judge scheduled his plea for May 10. Prosecutor Eric Bauman told the judge the Clark County District Attorney's office endorsed the deal.\n\"This is the first step toward a fair resolution to this matter and we look forward to closure for all parties involved,\" Ruggs' attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, said in a statement handed to reporters. They and their client and several people with them declined additional comment in the court hallway.\nCoroner says woman killed in crash caused by ex-Raider receiver burned to death\nEx-Raiders wide receiver Ruggs remains on house arrest in fatal crash case\nRuggs' lawyers lost a bid to prevent prosecutors from presenting evidence that Ruggs had a blood-alcohol level of 0.16% \u2014 twice the legal limit in Nevada \u2014 after the predawn rear-end wreck that killed 23-year-old Tina Tintor and her pet dog, Max.\nThe speed limit where the crash happened was 45 mph (72 kph), a fraction of what police said Ruggs was driving. Investigators found air bag computer records showing his 2020 Chevrolet Corvette decelerated from 156 mph (251 kph) to 127 mph (204 kph) seconds before slamming into Tintor's Toyota Rav 4.\nAn attorney who has represented Tintor's family members at earlier court appearances did not respond to email and telephone messages to him and his media representative about Ruggs' plea.\nOther charges to\u00a0be dismissed\nRuggs' sentencing will follow on another date in state court in Las Vegas. Other charges will be dismissed, including felony reckless driving, driving under the influence causing substantial injury to Ruggs' girlfriend, Je'nai Kilgo-Washington, and a misdemeanor gun charge. Police said they found a loaded handgun in Ruggs' demolished Corvette after the crash.\nRuggs was released by the Raiders shortly after the Nov. 2, 2021, crash. He could have faced more than 50 years in prison if convicted of all the charges at trial, District Attorney Steve Wolfson had said.\nWolfson declined to comment Tuesday, ahead of Ruggs' scheduled plea. The district attorney said following the crash that investigators learned that Ruggs spent several hours at a sports entertainment golfing venue in Las Vegas the evening before the predawn crash and may have been at a friend's home for several more hours before he and Kilgo-Washington headed home.\nRuggs posted $150,000 US bail to be freed from jail after leaving the hospital and has remained on house arrest for 18 months with strict conditions including alcohol checks.\nProsecutor says former Raiders WR Ruggs III drove 156 mph before fatal Vegas car crash\nMore NFL coverage\nBauman said outside court that Ruggs would remain on house arrest pending sentencing, and his minimum three-year sentence cannot be reduced by converting that to time already served.\nKilgo-Washington and Ruggs have a daughter together, and Kilgo-Washington was not cooperative with prosecutors as a victim in the substantial injury charge. Her attorney, Peter Christiansen, lost a bid to block prosecutors from getting Kilgo-Washington's medical records on privacy grounds.\nProsecutors said Ruggs suffered a leg injury and Kilgo-Washington underwent surgery for an arm injury.\nRuggs had been emerging as a star wide receiver for the Raiders before the crash, and records showed he owned a $1.1 million home not far from the crash scene. He had signed a four-year rookie contract reported to be worth more than $16 million.",

He got up but collapsed and had to be resuscitated on the field. The 24-year-old player was taken to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center in critical condition and spent a week there before being flown to Buffalo for further treatment. He was released Jan. 11.\nHe said last month that his doctors have concluded that a hit to the chest caused his heart to stop.

He was 87.\nA spokeswoman for Brown's family said he died peacefully in his Los Angeles home on Thursday night with his wife, Monique, by his side.\n\"To the world, he was an activist, actor, and football star,\" Monique Brown wrote in an Instagram post. \"To our family, he was a loving husband, father, and grandfather.

He appeared in more than 30 films, including \"Any Given Sunday\" and \"The Dirty Dozen.\"\nA powerful runner with speed and endurance, Brown's arrival sparked the game's burgeoning popularity on television and he remained an indomitable figure well after his playing days ended.\nBrown was also a champion for Black Americans and used his platform and voice to fight for equality.\n\"I hope every Black athlete takes the time to educate themselves about this incredible man and what he did to change all of our lives,\" NBA star LeBron James said. \"We all stand on your shoulders Jim Brown. If you grew up in Northeast Ohio and were Black, Jim Brown was a God.\"\nAlthough it\u2019s been 58 years since Jim Brown played his final NFL game, his reputation as one of the most dynamic players to ever step on a football field transcends generations. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HOFForever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HOFForever</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VqAlyr8J1s\">pic.twitter.com/VqAlyr8J1s</a>\n&mdash;\n@ProFootballHOF\nIn June 1967, Brown organized \"The Cleveland Summit,\" a meeting of the nation's top Black athletes, including Bill Russell and Lew Alcindor, who later became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, to support boxer Muhammad Ali's fight against serving in Vietnam.\nIn later years, he worked to curb gang violence in LA and in 1988 founded Amer-I-Can, a program to help disadvantaged inner-city youth and ex-convicts.\nOn the field, there was no one like Brown, who would blast through would-be tacklers, refusing to let one man take him down before sprinting away from linebackers and defensive backs. He was also famous for using a stiff arm to shed defenders in the open field or push them away like they were rag dolls.\nIncomparable on the field\nIndeed, Brown was unlike any back before him, and some feel there has never been anyone better than Cleveland's No. 32. At six-foot-two, 230 pounds, he was relentless, fighting for every yard, dragging multiple defenders along or finding holes where none seemed to exist.\nAfter Brown was tackled, he'd slowly rise and walk even more slowly back to the huddle \u2014 then dominate the defense when he got the ball again.\nA three-time NFL MVP and league champion with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Browns?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Browns</a> in 1964, Jim Brown was a force on the football field that provided lifelong memories to whomever had the privilege of watching him play. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HOFForever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HOFForever</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Kst5J2UWug\">pic.twitter.com/Kst5J2UWug</a>\n&mdash;\n@ProFootballHOF\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell offered his condolences on behalf of the league.\n\"Jim Brown was a gifted athlete \u2014 one of the most dominant players to ever step on any athletic field \u2014 but also a cultural figure who helped promote change,\" Goodell said. \"During his nine-year NFL career, which coincided with the civil rights movement here at home, he became a forerunner and role model for athletes being involved in social initiatives outside their sport.\"\nOff the field, Brown was a contentious, complicated figure.\nWhile he had a soft spot for those in need, he also was arrested a half-dozen times, mostly on charges of hitting women.\nIn June 1999, Brown's wife called 911, saying Brown had smashed her car with a shovel and threatened to kill her. During the trial, Monique Brown recanted. Jim Brown was acquitted of a charge of domestic threats but convicted of misdemeanor vandalism. A Los Angeles judge sentenced Brown to six months in jail when he refused to attend domestic violence counselling.\nHe also feuded with Browns coach Paul Brown and later with the team's management, although he played his entire career with Cleveland.\nLengthy acting career\nWhen his playing days ended, Brown set off for Hollywood and eventually settled there. Brown advised Cleveland coach Blanton Collier of his retirement while the team was in training camp and he was on the set of \"The Dirty Dozen\" in England.\nAmong his films were \"100 Rifles,\" \"Mars Attacks!\" Spike Lee's \"He Got Game,\" Oliver Stone's \"Any Given Sunday,\" and \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,\" which parodied the blaxploitation genre. In 2002, Brown was the subject of Lee's HBO documentary \"Jim Brown: All-American.\"\nIn recent years, Brown's relationship with the Browns was inconsistent. He served as an adviser to owner Randy Lerner and was hired to counsel the team's younger players. However, in 2010, Brown parted ways with the team after having his role reduced by incoming team president Mike Holmgren. Brown felt slighted by the perceived demotion \u2014 when the club unveiled a \"Ring of Honor\" inside its downtown stadium, Brown didn't attend the ceremony in protest.\nThe Browns erected a statue of Brown outside their stadium in 2016.\nJim Brown Forever \ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udd0e\u267e\ufe0f<br><br>Legend.

In February, he attended the NFL Honors ceremony when the league announced it had renamed its league rushing title as The Jim Brown Award.\nBrown was an eight-time All-Pro and went to the Pro Bowl in each of his nine years in the league. When he retired, he held the league's records for yards (12,312) and touchdowns (126).\n\"He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers how much it hurts,\"' said Hall of Fame tight end John Mackey. \"He lived by that philosophy and I always followed that advice.\"\nBorn on Feb. 17, 1936, in St. Simons Island, Georgia, Brown was a multisport star at Manhasset High School on Long Island. He averaged 14.9 yards per carry in football and once scored 55 points in a game.\nA two-sport star at Syracuse \u2014 some say he is the best lacrosse player in NCAA history \u2014 Brown endured countless racist taunts while playing at the virtually all-white school at the time. Still, he was an All-American in both sports and lettered in basketball.\n'Jim Brown is the best'\nBrown was the sixth overall pick of the 1957 draft, joining a team that routinely played for the title. He was the Offensive Rookie of the Year that season.\nRunning behind an offensive line featuring Hall of Fame tackles Lou Groza and Mike McCormack, Brown set a league mark with 1,527 yards and scored 17 TDs on his way to the league's Most Outstanding Player award \u2014 a precursor to the MVP \u2014 in 1958. Over the next three seasons, he never ran for less than 1,257 yards before finishing with 996 in 1962.\nHe led the NFL in rushing eight times, gaining a career-best 1,863 yards in 1963. He averaged 104 yards per game, scored 106 rushing touchdowns and averaged an astounding 5.2 yards per carry. A dangerous receiver as well, Brown finished with 262 catches for 2,499 yards and another 20 TDs.\n\"I've said many times, and I will always say, Jim Brown is the best,\" Hall of Fame running back Gale Sayers once said, \"and he will still be the best long after all his records are broken.\"\nNumber retired in Cleveland\nBrown's No. 32 was retired by the Browns in '71, the same year he entered the Hall of Fame. But he rarely visited Cleveland during the 1970s and '80s. He and Cleveland owner Art Modell were at odds over his sudden retirement; the two later patched up their differences and remained friends.\nBrown supported Modell's decision to move Cleveland's franchise to Baltimore in 1995. It was both a reflection of his loyalty to Modell and another sign of his fierce independence. Brown was one of the few former Browns players not angry with Modell for moving the team.\nMany modern players couldn't appreciate Brown or his impact on American sports.\n\"They have grown up in a different era,\" former Browns coach Romeo Crennel said. \"He's one of the greatest players in NFL history and what he was able to accomplish in his time was tremendous. I don't know that anybody could do what he did, the way he did it, under the circumstances that he had to operate and the things that he had to endure.\n\"And for him to go out on top, that's something that not many guys are able to appreciate either.\"\nBrown is survived by his wife and son, Aris; daughter, Morgan, son, Jim Jr.; daughter, Kimberly; son, Kevin; daughter, Shellee; and daughter, Kim. He was preceded in death by his daughter, Karen Ward.",

Then it's back to the\u00a0hotel where the learning continues, studying the team playbook with roomate Trenton Simpson, a rookie linebacker from Clemson University.\n\"[We] have grown close,\" he said of Simpson. \"We're in the hotel, going over the playbook together, going over our footwork and stuff together.\"\u00a0\n\"We don't have school now, so there's more time on just football, which I love. So it's football during the day and then we get back to our hotel and it's more football.

He's gone from the local\u00a0minor football league, to high school football at Guelph CVI, the University of Guelph Gryphons, and then the last three years at the University of Mississippi, also known as Ole Miss in the SEC division of the NCAA.\nTavius stands at 6 foot 6 inches, weighing 260 pounds. He's played mostly in defensive positions at the post secondary level but while he was in high school he played both offense and defense.\nFormer football coach at Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute (GCVI) Dan Crabbe described Robinson as a player who \"just loved the game\".\n\"Yeah, he has an incredible motor,\" said Crabbe.\n\"We talk about the idea of the motor:\u00a0his is like, it just never stops. He would go on the field at kickoff and basically not leave the field because he would play both sides of the ball. He'd play offensive tackle, he'd played defensive end, he would play special teams and he just never came off the field.\"\nTavius Robinson wearing the number 95 jersey with outside linebacker coach Chuck Smith.

He was probably one of the nicest, most humble, coachable, caring, considerate, fantastic teammates,\" said Tersigni.\n\"Well respected by all of his teammates and all of the opposition, I have not ever heard of a mean word said of Tavius.\"\nTersigni coached both Tavius and his father Patrick, whom he described as one of the best defensive players.\u00a0\nUniversity coaches with the Guelph Gryphons Ryan Sheahan and Brian Cluff echo Crabbe and Tersigni's comments of athleticism and attitude, adding it's going to be exciting to see how the Baltimore Ravens will place him in their defensive scheme.\n'Grateful'\n\"I'm grateful for my family and friends that have supported me up to this point.

        "summary": "NFL owners unanimously approved the sale of the Washington Commanders on Thursday from Dan Snyder to a group led by Josh Harris and including Magic Johnson for a record $6.05 billion US.",
        "content": "NFL owners unanimously approved the sale of the Washington Commanders on Thursday from Dan Snyder to a group led by Josh Harris and including Magic Johnson for a record $6.05 billion, right before the league announced a $60 million fine for Snyder for improprieties corroborated by its investigation into workplace culture and business dealings.\n\"We are humbled and awed by the level of responsibility that we have to take care of the city, to win championships and really excite the fans again,\" Harris said in a news conference after the vote.\nThe purchase by Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment is the highest price paid for a North American professional sports club. Harris, like Snyder and Commissioner Roger Goodell, grew up in the Washington metro area as an avid fan of the team.\n\"He has a remarkable business record, not just in finance but also now in sports, and I think he's a person who cares deeply about not just his assets but at least more importantly his communities,\" Goodell said.\nCommanders' Dan Snyder fined $60M US for sexually harassing employee, financial improprieties\nThe sale was expected to close in the coming days and thus finalize an ugly two-plus decades for one of the NFL's oldest franchises. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones beamed in a brief interview with reporters on his way into the meeting.\n\"It's a hallmark day,\" Jones said. \"I'm excited about the prospects of going into Washington and giving them some capital punishment.\"\nOwners also received an in-person summary from former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White on her investigation for the NFL into the Commanders that was launched 1 1/2 years ago launched in light of the congressional review into workplace misconduct that also included a referral to the Federal Trade Commission for potential business improprieties by Snyder.\nThe probe corroborated an allegation that Snyder sexually harassed a former team employee who first brought that account forward in front of a House committee.\nWhite's report also confirmed that team executives under Snyder's supervision deliberately withheld millions of dollars in revenue from other clubs.\nSnyder had owned his favourite boyhood team since 1999, when he bought it for $800 million. Success was fleeting, both on and off the field. With Snyder in charge, the team made the playoffs just six times in 24 years, only twice won a postseason game and went 166-226-2 overall. The franchise has lost a significant amount of lustre\u00a0from the glory days under coach Joe Gibbs, who won three Super Bowls in his 12-year run from 1981-92.\nHouse report: Dan Snyder had role in 'toxic' Commanders culture\nMagic Johnson joins Josh Harris' bid to buy NFL's Washington Commanders: report\nThen there were the problems outside of football, from a feud with minority owners that led Snyder to buy out their shares of the team to allegations of sexual harassment by former employees, which prompted a series of investigations into workplace misconduct. Over and over again, Snyder said he would never sell the team.\nThe tide began to shift on that front last October when Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said there was \"merit to remove\" Snyder, an ouster that would have required votes from at least 24 of the other 31 clubs. Two weeks later, Snyder and his wife Tanya hired a firm to begin exploring a sale of part or all of one of the NFL's oldest franchises \u2014 one that has called the nation's capital home since 1937.\nUltimately, that process led to a group chaired by Harris. His investment crew also includes David Blitzer, with whom he co-owns the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL's New Jersey Devils, Washington-area businessman Mitchell Rales and more than a dozen others. The unusually large ownership group needed and received league finance approval for a deal that shattered the $4.35 billion Walmart heir Rob Walton paid last year for the Denver Broncos.\nThe special meeting for the Commanders sale was conducted at the same hotel adjacent to the Mall of America in suburban Minneapolis where Walton's group gained formal control of the Broncos. Johnson raved about the approval of the sale on Twitter \u2014 \"truly the biggest achievement in my business career,\" he tweeted \u2014 shortly before Harris posed for photos with a Commanders helmet and accepted well wishes from Goodell and others.\n\"They want to put that franchise where they believe it belongs, where it's respected not just in the community but worldwide,\" Goodell said. \"They're committed to that.\"\nImmediate challenge to build new stadium\nTheir biggest immediate challenge for the long-term future of the organization is a new stadium to replace FedEx Field, the rushed-to-completion home of the team since 1997 in Landover, Maryland, that has not aged well. Virginia abandoned a stadium bill more than a year ago, a consequence of the number of off-field controversies swirling around the team. The site of RFK Stadium, the club's previous home in the capitol city, has significant backing as the place for the new venue.\n\"It's going to take awhile to unpack what really makes sense,\" Harris said. \"As far as RFK, I understand it's the spiritual home of the history of the Commanders.\nBringing the fans back is a major priority after Washington ranked last in the league in attendance in 2022 and second-to-last in 2021. The team rebranded last year as the Commanders after dropping the name Redskins in 2020 and generically going by the Washington Football Team for two seasons.\n\"I've had many sleepless nights, and I will have many sleepless nights. I'm going to sweat this,\" Harris said. \"I feel an awesome responsibility to the city of Washington. I know what I've got to give.\"",

        "content": "Northwestern University fired coach Pat Fitzgerald on Monday amid a hazing scandal that called into question his leadership of the program and damaged the university's reputation after it mishandled its response to the allegations.\nFitzgerald's dismissal completed a rapid fall from grace for the former All-American linebacker, the star of the 1995 Northwestern team that won the Big Ten and played in the Rose Bowl after years of losing. The 48-year-old Fitzgerald had been firmly entrenched at his alma mater, an annual fixture on any list of college coaches with the most job security.\n\"The head coach is ultimately responsible for the culture of his team,\" Northwestern President Michael Schill wrote in an open letter to the university community. \"The hazing we investigated was widespread and clearly not a secret within the program, providing Coach Fitzgerald with the opportunity to learn what was happening. Either way, the culture in Northwestern Football, while incredible in some ways, was broken in others.\"\nFitzgerald went 110-101 in 17 seasons as Northwestern's head coach. He led the Wildcats to Big Ten West championships in 2018 and 2020, plus five bowl victories. But they went 4-20 over his last two seasons.\nCW: This story contains mention of hazing, sexual assault and suicidal ideation.<br><br>BREAKING: A former Northwestern football player is alleging that some of the hazing conduct that took place on the team involved coerced sexual acts. \ud83e\uddf5<a href=\"https://t.co/idm3mRYMdV\">https://t.co/idm3mRYMdV</a>\n&mdash;\n@thedailynu\nSchill wrote in his letter that athletic director Derrick Gragg will announce \"the leadership for this upcoming football season\" in the next couple days. The opener is Sept. 3 at Rutgers.\n\"I recognize that my decision will not be universally applauded, and there will be those in our community who may vehemently disagree with it,\" Schill wrote. \"Ultimately, I am charged with acting in the best interests of the entire University, and this decision is reflective of that. The damage done to our institution is significant, as is the harm to some of our students.\"\nGragg was hired by Northwestern in June 2021. He got the job after Mike Polisky stepped down amid mounting criticism because he was named in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the Big Ten school by former Wildcats cheerleaders.\nFitzgerald had been serving a two-week suspension after the school said Friday that an investigation by a law firm did not find \"sufficient\" evidence that the coaching staff knew about ongoing hazing \u2014 though there were \"significant opportunities\" to find out about it.\nSchill, who was the president of the University of Oregon before taking over Northwestern in September, said in his Monday letter that the report from ArentFox Schiff will remain confidential. But he wrote that, during the investigation, 11 current or former players acknowledged the hazing within the program.\n\"The hazing included forced participation, nudity and sexualized acts of a degrading nature, in clear violation of Northwestern policies and values,\" Schill wrote.\nHere\u2019s the statement on the Fitz decision from University pres. Michael Schill. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedailynu?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@thedailynu</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/otC9btYL94\">pic.twitter.com/otC9btYL94</a>\n&mdash;\n@nicolejmarkus\nAfter Northwestern announced its suspension for Fitzgerald, The Daily Northwestern published a story on Saturday detailing allegations from a former player who described specific instances of hazing and sexual abuse. The report also indicated that Fitzgerald \"may have known that hazing took place.\"\nThat led Schill to write a letter to the university community in which he acknowledged focusing \"too much on what the report concluded [Fitzgerald]\u00a0didn't know and not enough on what he should have known.\" Schill went on to say that he planned to speak with university leadership, members of the board of trustees and leaders of the faculty senate to determine his next steps.\n\"Since Friday, I have kept going back to what we should reasonably expect from our head coaches, our faculty and our campus leaders,\" Schill wrote in Monday's letter. \"And that is what led me to make this decision.\"\nBecause the six-month investigation was confidential, Schill said in Monday's letter that he learned many of the details recently. He spoke with the complainant on Sunday after talking to the student's parents on Friday.\nFitzgerald, who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008, was hired to coach his alma mater in 2006 after the sudden death of then-coach Randy Walker.\nMany current and former players rushed to Fitzgerald's defence after the suspension was announced.\nA letter circulated on social media, signed by \"The ENTIRE Northwestern Football Team\" without identifying an author, said that \"throughout his tenure, Coach Fitzgerald has consistently prioritized the well-being and development of his players, and we stand behind him in his unwavering commitment to our team.\"\nBefore Fitzgerald's dismissal was announced by the school, The Daily Northwestern published a report that had three former Northwestern players describing a \"culture of enabling racism.\"\nThe turmoil within the football program comes after the school unveiled plans in September to build a new Ryan Field. The plans call for a state-of-the-art facility featuring a reduced seating capacity and greater emphasis on the fan experience.",

        "content": "Washington Commanders owner Dan Snyder sexually harassed a team employee and oversaw team executives who deliberately withheld millions of dollars in revenue from other clubs, and he has agreed to pay a $60 million US fine, the league announced Thursday.\nThe NFL released a 23-page report detailing the findings of an independent investigation into Snyder's conduct just minutes after its owners unanimously approved the sale of the Commanders to Josh Harris for a record $6.05 billion. The fine represents 1 per cent of the sale price; Snyder bought the team, then known as the Redskins, for $800 million.\nNFL owners unanimously approve record sale of Commanders to Josh Harris\nThe investigation was led by former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Mary Jo White and conducted by her law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton. The league had pledged to make the findings of the probe public.\nInvestigators concluded that Washington withheld $11 million in revenue that should have been shared with other teams, an amount the report suggests may have been far greater. White's firm was unable to reach a conclusion about tens of millions of additional dollars that may have been withheld in part because Snyder and the team did not cooperate fully with the investigation, according to the report.\nThe report concluded that Snyder sexually harassed former team employee Tiffani Johnston, allegations that Johnston first made last year in front of a House committee. Snyder placed his hand on Johnston's thigh at a team dinner and pushed her toward his car as they were leaving the restaurant, the report said.\n\"The findings do speak for themselves. In both cases, it's inappropriate, it's wrong, it doesn't match our values,\" Commissioner Roger Goodell said at a news conference in Minnesota after NFL owners voted.\nHouse report: Dan Snyder had role in 'toxic' Commanders culture\nMagic Johnson joins Josh Harris' bid to buy NFL's Washington Commanders: report\nSnyder has denied Johnston's allegations and repeated that denial in an interview with White's investigators. He only agreed to speak with investigators for one hour, the report said.\nInvestigators spoke with Johnston several times and \"found her to be highly credible,\" the report said, and her account was corroborated by witnesses and other evidence. The investigation also substantiated claims by another former employee, Jason Friedman, who told the House about financial improprieties.\n\"Dan Snyder has been forced to sell the team he said he would never sell, pay a massive fine to the NFL and there now exists an extensive public record of his personal wrongdoing and the misconduct that occurred under his leadership,\" attorneys Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represent Johnston and Friedman, said in a statement. \"We are proud of our clients' courage in coming forward publicly and working tirelessly to hold Mr. Snyder accountable.\"\nThe report also concluded that a former team executive improperly took possession of a photograph of Johnston from a calendar shoot of the team's cheerleaders. Johnston was wearing lingerie in the photo, which had not been edited \"to fully cover inadvertent exposures.\" Investigators found insufficient evidence to show Snyder was personally involved in that incident.\n'Every dollar matters'\nWhite's firm did not conclude whether Snyder was personally aware of the financial misdeeds, but witnesses told investigators that Snyder repeatedly pressured team employees to improve its financial performance, telling them, \"every dollar matters.\" Documents detailing how the team moved revenue into accounts that shielded the money from other teams were shared with Snyder on at least one occasion, the report said.\n\"At a minimum, [Snyder]\u00a0was aware of certain efforts to minimize revenue sharing, at least some of which were later found to be in violation of the NFL rules,\" the report said.\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House's oversight committee, said White's findings contradicted Snyder's sworn testimony and introduced two bills intended to protect American workers from the abuses committed by Snyder and the Commanders.\nIn order to skirt NFL revenue-sharing rules, Washington would classify team-related revenue as money made from special events such as concerts, college football games or soccer games.\n\"[I]f the NFL had a jail ... we would be in it,\" a team employee wrote to its chief financial officer in 2010 after agreeing to allocate NFL revenue to a college game.\nMore NFL coverage\nFriedman alleged that the Commanders had \"a second set of books,\" and the investigation corroborated his account. Among its findings were that millions of dollars in revenue from \"tickets sold or bartered with sponsors at falsely undervalued prices\" were moved into accounts that hid the money from the league.\nIn addition to the $11 million that White's firm found the team withheld from the league, forensic accountants who reviewed the team's books identified another $44 million in parking, license and other revenues that were transferred from accounts holding league revenue into special events accounts.\nThe report notes that the team's revenue-shielding scheme \"appear[s]\u00a0to have become more aggressive after its ticket sales began deteriorating in 2008.\" Washington had long touted a decades-long waiting list for season tickets, but demand cratered under Snyder's stewardship of the team, which went 166-226-2 overall and won only two playoff games during his 24 years as owner.\nSnyder long had a reputation for squeezing every possible dollar out of fans, from aggressive pricing of parking and concessions to charging fans to attend training camp. He even filed lawsuits against fans for cancelling their season tickets. The District of Columbia Attorney General's office reached a settlement with Snyder over the team's failure to return season-ticket security deposits.\nWhite's firm wrote that while Snyder and the team pledged to fully cooperate with investigators, they did not. Instead, the Commanders failed to produce requested documents, declined to let investigators speak to the team's external auditors, and engaged in other tactics that \"delayed and impeded the investigation.\"\n\"Evidencing his individual failure to cooperate, Mr. Snyder engaged in months of scheduling, cancelling, and rescheduling of his interview,\" the report said.\n\u00a0",

He shared game day duties through the '90s with a guy named Don Trevena.\u00a0After that, it was just dad for decades until he retired at the end of the 2022 season.\nIt was around that time, when he became the one and only Gainer,\u00a0that I began my career as his handler, both at games and events.\nOnce everything but the top piece was on, he would usually have a few minutes to sit in silence, my dad's head sticking out of a gopher's body.\nSaskatchewan Roughriders mascot Gainer the Gopher celebrates a touchdown against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Mosaic Stadium in Regina in 2013.\n \n(Liam Richards/The Canadian Press)\nI would sit with him, quietly observing\u00a0as he mapped out the game in his head. Commotion bounced off the walls around us as game-day staffers, cheerleaders, opposing team members and the officials geared up.\nHe would hold his watch as he sat. He knew the exact minute he had to be ready. When the time came, he would say something like, \"All right,\u00a0I better get my ass out there,\" put on the head \u2014 for years it was attached to a Cooper hockey helmet \u2014 and tighten the chin strap.\nThat head never had any fans built into it to help with the heat.\u00a0My dad never wore ice-pack vests to keep him cool. He knew he could face heat exhaustion, especially during mid-summer games, but that never deterred him.\nThe last step was the gloves. I always stuck around to help him tuck them into his arm sleeves and make sure that his collar was set in the back. After that, I said, \"All right, see ya out there. Don't be late.\"\nHe never was.\nOur road trips together\nYou know the feeling of waking up absurdly early for a vacation flight? You didn't sleep well, you fight a little bit of anxiety, but you're excited and want to get the show on the road.\nThat's the feeling I had every time I rose before dawn to travel to whatever small Saskatchewan town Gainer the Gopher was scheduled to visit\u00a0that day.\nWe had a consistent routine that began with a stop at Robin's for doughnuts and Vi-Co, Saskatchewan slang for\u00a0chocolate milk.\nThese road trips became cherished moments for me. The lessons my dad taught me on those long drives planted seeds deep inside my heart that have since sprouted and grown into the thoughts, ideas and relationships that I nurture today.\nSaskatchewan Roughriders mascot Gainer the Gopher gets cheers from fans outside the Saskatchewan Legislative building in Regina after a parade celebrating the team's Grey Cup victory in 2013.\n \n(Liam Richards/The Canadian Press)\nMy dad taught me that if I wanted something, there was no reason why I couldn't put in the work to make it mine. I learned how to treat people, how to be respectful and professional.\u00a0\nHe also listened to me, helped me find the demons that could eat me up\u00a0and gave me the tools to defeat them.\nI learned that life is a gift and that I'm in charge of it.\nGame day\nGame day mornings were always the same. There was a quiet excitement and a feeling of responsibility.\u00a0\nDuring the pre-game,\u00a0we planned how to work each section of the stadium and in what order. We would\u00a0also take inventory of the Gainer cart, a wagon that dad had\u00a0spray-painted green. Over the years that cart carried all sorts of Gainer game-day essentials: referee mannequins, fake 30-pound weights, giant water guns, \"I'm with stupid\" signs, and Gainer stuffed animal toys.\u00a0\nAdvice for new dads, just in time for Father's Day\nFirst Person\nHow my adoptive father motivated me to revitalize Indigenous kinship law\nGainer's intro always came at a specific time on the pre-game countdown clock. I was always on edge in the minutes before he came out, thinking about what could go wrong. Then I'd hear it.\u00a0\n\"And now, all the way from Parkbeg, Saskatchewan, the number one mascot in the CFL \u2014\u00a0GAINER THE GOPHER!\"\nEvery single time he ran onto the field, goosebumps covered my skin and tears welled in my eyes.\nGainer the Gopher greets the crowd during first half CFL action between the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the Calgary Stampeders in Regina on July 6, 2019.\n \n(Matt Smith/The Canadian Press)\nDad would stay on the field for the players' intro and national anthem. After that, everyone cleared the field except for the players and officials \u2014 and Gainer. He figured out a long time ago that if he stayed at midfield\u00a0for the coin toss, no one asked him to leave.\u00a0\nAfter it was decided who would kick off and who would receive, players from both teams would return to their benches, but my dad would stand there alone just for a second. I always loved watching him take it all in. After all the years, this was still a special moment for him and I loved that. When he did come to the sidelines, I would have his NOISE sign ready for kick-off.\u00a0\nThe crowd adored him. In those moments, I was the proudest son in the world.\u00a0\nDad has retired from his time as Gainer now. Just remember that, for a long time, there was just one man underneath that stinky fur that made it all happen.\nHe's the smartest, most caring, loving, helpful, generous man I know. Of course, he'll always be my dad, but to me\u00a0he'll also always be Gainer the Gopher.\nInterested in writing for us?

        "content": "Canadian running back Dahrran Diedrick, who led Nebraska to an NCAA championship berth and later won three Grey Cup titles over a 10-year CFL career, died early Saturday morning after a battle with cancer. He was 44.\nThe Montreal Alouettes, the team Diedrick won two of his Grey Cups with, confirmed his passing. Hall of Fame quarterback Anthony Calvillo, currently the CFL team's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, was a teammate of Diedrick's for eight seasons in La Belle Province.\n\"I won two championships with Dahrran, and he was a very important piece of our team,\" Calvillo said in a statement. \"He was always in a good mood and got along with everyone in our dressing room.\n\"He leaves us far too young, and I send my best thoughts to his loved ones.\"\nThe six-foot, 225-pound Diedrick, who was born in Jamaica but raised in Toronto, was the first Canadian-born scholarship recruit to play for the University of Nebraska. In 2001, Diedrick started for the Cornhuskers, rushing for a Big 12-leading 1,299 yards and 15 touchdowns.\nDiedrick helped Nebraska reach the '02 Rose Bowl, which also happened to be the NCAA national championship game. But the Miami Hurricanes captured the title with a 37-14 victory.\nHowever, Diedrick also excelled in he classroom at Nebraska. In 2002, he was one of five Cornhuskers who played that season with their degree in hand.\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the friends, family, and former coaches and teammates of Dahrran Diedrick during this difficult time. Another life tragically cut short by cancer. <a href=\"https://t.co/l6pQlhVXyt\">https://t.co/l6pQlhVXyt</a>\n&mdash;\n@RandyAmbrosie\nDiedrick earned his undergraduate criminal justice degree in December 2001 and completed his undergraduate work with a 3.165 cumulative GPA. He finished his collegiate football career with 2,745 yards rushing on 502 carries with 26 touchdowns.\nEdmonton selected Diedrick in the third round of the '02 CFL draft but the running back opted to return to school before signing with the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent the following year. He also had stints with the Green Bay Packers and Washington Commanders, playing one game in 2004.\nHe joined Edmonton in 2005, earning his first Grey Cup that year.\nDiedrick was then acquired by Montreal, where he played from 2006 to 2013, winning Grey Cups in 2009 and '10. Following a short stint with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 2013 he returned to the Alouettes for his final season in 2014.\nDahrran Diedrick, right, celebrates with defensive lineman Eric Wilson after scoring a touchdown against the Blue Bombers in September 2011.\n \n(Jason Halstead/The Canadian Press)\nIt was during the 2014 campaign that Diedrick was diagnosed with hepatosplenic gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, a rare but very aggressive form of the disease. He retired at season's end but later served as the Toronto Argonauts strength coach in 2017, earning a fourth Grey Cup ring that season.\nDiedrick ran for 872 yards on 179 carries over 130 CFL regular-season games with six touchdowns.\n\"Dahrran was a very good friend of mine in the locker room, and we kept in touch after our careers,\" said Eric Deslauriers, Montreal's senior director of football operations who also spent eight seasons as a teammate of Diedrick's with the Alouettes. \"I remember a very physical player when he had the ball, no one could take it away from him.\n\"My thoughts are with his loved ones and his family, my heart is very heavy right now.\"",

        "content": "Hosting a Grey Cup and playing a full season has the Saskatchewan Roughriders seeing green.\nThe club released its annual financial report on Wednesday night.\nThe team's operating income last year was $3.9\u00a0million, almost identical to its total in 2021-22.\nHosting the 109th\u00a0Grey Cup was a big financial boon, bringing in an additional $3.3 million in net income. The team's total net income for last year was $7.2\u00a0million.\u00a0\nThe net income is close to what the team lost in 2020-21. The COVID-19 pandemic cancelled the 2020 season, resulting in $7.5 million in losses.\n\"Here we are two years later and I'm pleased to announce strong financial results for the club,\" said Kent Paul, Roughriders chief financial officer, on Wednesday.\nPaul said both the total expense and total revenue were up by $6 million in 2022-23 and that was primarily due to the return to a full CFL\u00a0schedule of 18 games, down from 14 in the pandemic shortened 2021 season.\nOne area that saw decreases was revenue from club merchandise sales, which was offset by $1 million in merchandise sales during Grey Cup.\nGrey Cup organizers won't release attendance numbers, but revenue expected to be high\nThe team also saw a dip in revenue of $2.7 million due to not receiving government COVID-19 relief and not hosting a home playoff game.\nWinning on the field can boost ticket sales and improve the bottom line. The Roughriders struggled on the field, starting 3-0 at home but then losing six in a row at Mosaic Stadium. The team also missed the playoffs.\u00a0Paul said hosting a home playoff game can net at least $400,000 for the team.\nOverall revenues and expenses returned to what Paul termed as \"normal.\"\nRoughriders aiming to make games more affordable\nPaul said ticket sales for 2023 are down from 2022, but did not provide a number.\n\"Every year we hope we are going to get back to our stronger ticket sales. We are not far off, it's something that we are managing, but we are also reflective of the situation Rider Nation and our fanbase is facing.\"\nHe said one factor is not hosting the Grey Cup. He said a season ticket offering access to a Grey Cup ticket\u00a0leads to higher season ticket sales.\nPaul said the biggest issue according to fans is affordability, so this season the team took the following steps:\n$99 family packages.\n$5 menu items.\nLower parking fees.\nReduced prices on 9,000 seats.\nPaul said the team is also trying to \"create entertainment value\" by booking halftime acts and doing giveaways to fans.\n\"Every game, every week, every month we are monitoring where our results are at and adjusting where we need to, and this year we're trying to make it as affordable as we can, recognizing we are not immune to the inflationary factors as well.\"",

I know we had a fumble when we were driving, just a bunch of opportunities that we kind of squandered.\"\nAdd to that the uncertainty before the game, last-minute lineup changes, and poor playing conditions and it wasn't business as usual for the Alouettes.\n\"There are a lot of outside factors that we just had to shut off throughout the play,\" admitted Fajardo. \"It wasn't just `go out and play football' like it normally is.\"\nJumpin' Caesar's catfish \ud83d\ude31<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CFLGameday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CFLGameday</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wpg_BlueBombers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Wpg_BlueBombers</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/fNH48IWQjf\">pic.twitter.com/fNH48IWQjf</a>\n&mdash;\n@CFL\nTrailing 10-0 to start the second half, the Alouettes were in desperate need of an offensive boost to kick things off. Gaining 20 yards on their first two plays, the Als were creeping into Winnipeg's defensive zone, only to lose possession on a fumble forced by Winnipeg's Deatrick Nicholls.\n\"It was hard to score points tonight,\" said Fajardo. \"It's very difficult to move the ball in those elements and it's very difficult to stay on the field. In those situations I felt like the turnovers caused us to get down on ourselves.\"\nWhen the Blue Bombers had the ball, they were a force to be reckoned with. While they matched the Alouettes in effort, they had them totally beat when it came to execution. Winnipeg native Brady Oliveira in particular did a stellar job of keeping his team in enemy territory, totalling 112 rushing yards on the night.\nShake and bake!<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CFLGameday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CFLGameday</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wpg_BlueBombers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Wpg_BlueBombers</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dschoen5?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dschoen5</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/YGluZ1gjQ5\">pic.twitter.com/YGluZ1gjQ5</a>\n&mdash;\n@CFL\nLate in the third quarter, things finally seemed to turn in the Alouettes' favour with an impressive 65-yard pass from Fajardo to receiver Kaion Julien-Grant giving Alouettes fans hope the team had found its offensive spark, only to be denied entry into the end zone with a killer interception by Winnipeg defensive back Brandon Alexander, which was returned 62 yards, putting them right back where they started.\n\"I have to give them credit,\" Maas said of the Bombers' defensive abilities. \"They're able to create pressure.\"\nIt's this constant pressure that kept the Alouettes offence from capitalizing on their possessions. Not only did the Blue Bombers force three fumbles, but they also kept their defensive line tight, providing little space for the Alouettes to create plays. Alouettes' punter Joseph Zema was forced to punt six times throughout the night, totalling 304 yards.\nFormer CFL running back Dahrran Diedrick dead at 44 after battle with cancer\nTiger-Cats face boos as Alouettes spoil Hamilton's home opener with dominant win\nMidway through the fourth quarter, the Alouettes were able to get on the scoreboard as rookie receiver Austin Mack broke into the end zone to capitalize on a 20-yard pass from Fajardo. Upon review the pass was deemed incomplete, but the home team still managed to make something of their possession with a 27-yard field goal from kicker David Cote.\nWhile the Alouettes tried to create some additional offence to close out the game, Winnipeg held them off to secure a 17-3 victory, snapping not one but two Alouettes streaks in the process.\nwith the Alouettes set to take on the BC Lions in Week 5, coach Jason Maas and quarterback Cody Fajardo both said they'll be putting this loss behind them and going back to the drawing board so the Alouettes can go into next week's matchup a little more efficient on offence.\n\"We're going to watch the film, we're going to bury it and we get another opportunity next week,\" said Fajardo.",

        "summary": "Ticats strength and conditioning coach Marcellus Bowman has a few suggestions for people trying to stay in shape, even in this extreme heat.",
        "content": "Stay hydrated, Hamilton Tiger-Cat Strength and Conditioning Coach Marcellus Bowman says. It might save you from serious injury while trying to work out in\u00a0this extreme heat.\nA heat warning remains in effect for much of southern Ontario, with Environment Canada warning of temperatures climbing above 30 C. Temperatures are expected to be 29 and 30 C, with humidex values of 37 to 40. The federal weather agency is reminding people that hot and humid air can also bring deteriorating air quality and can result in the Air Quality Health Index approaching the high risk category.\nBowman spoke with the CBC's Sarah Galashan on Tuesday July, 4, 2023 about what pro and amateur athletes should be doing to keep themselves safe while working out. Here's a transcript of the interview. You can watch the video of the full interview above.\nMarcellus Bowman, founder of EatSleepPeak fitness and nutrition service\nThe Ticats just practicing in this heat.. 90 minutes! What was that like for you and the players?\nWe just got off the field a little bit ago and it went really well.\u00a0I mean, we talked to the players for like, hey, listen, it's going to be hot and it's the basics... hydrate, which you have to do to perform at a high level.\nWhat do you tell non-athletes who want to run or practice - and it feels like it's 40 degrees outside and humid?\nWell, the biggest thing is what you do before you go outside, right? You cannot handle it the same way you would handle a \"regular\" temperature day.\u00a0You have to make sure you are over-hydrated if anything, and it can't just be water. You have to have a Gatorade. You have to have some electrolytes in you. Have some calories and you can go ahead and handle business.\nIs there a point where it is just NOT advisable to exercise outside?\nHonestly, if you've been exercising for a consistent amount of time, say, over the last 4 to 6 weeks, you should be in a good spot. The biggest thing to keep in mind is to make sure you abbreviate your workout. If you're not familiar with training in the heat, you have to shorten it up, see how your body responds\u00a0so you can go ahead and make a better decision next time.\nYou work with pro athletes... playing at an elite level. Are the risks the same for them?\nI wouldn't say it's exactly the same. You know, the athletes that\u00a0I used to be and the ones we're dealing with now, they have trained for six months prior to the season start.\u00a0A lot of these guys train in Florida, Texas and so forth. So, they are much more likely to handle the heat a lot better than the average person who trains 3 to 4 times a week. So on average, I would be less worried about a professional athlete compared to a regular person. But at the end of the day, it really does depend on how your level of conditioning is at that moment. If it's in a good spot, then you're safe to go ahead.\nIf you are going to work out\u00a0outside what do you have to do to make the most of it?\nKeep it simple and keep it short.\u00a0And make sure you have something to drink with you. So, what that could look like is, you know, you can walk in there and say every 15 minutes take a few squats, maybe a few pushups, depending on where you are, and then walk and\u00a0if you're feeling good, then\u00a0go into a little bit of a jog, but you want to start simple and short.\nCan you get used to this heat? \n100 per cent.\u00a0The body is amazing at adapting as long as you give it time to rest in between.\u00a0The danger is when you stack three or four consistent days of high heat, high output activity, that's where things get a little sticky. But if you have one day where it's high heat, you go ahead and get a good workout in and you give yourself some time to recover from that, you should be fine and you give yourself enough time to go ahead and adapt and be better the next time.\n\u00a0",

        "content": "He came to Canada chasing an opportunity to continue playing football. On Monday night, Derrell (Mookie) Mitchell will forever be a part of the Toronto Argonauts.\nToronto (2-0) will add the speedy receiver and veteran quarterback Damon Allen to its all-time team before hosting the B.C. Lions (3-0) at BMO Field. That will boost the overall number to 24.\nThe five-foot-nine, 190-pound Mitchell spent eight of his 11 CFL seasons with Toronto (1997-03, 2007). The 51-year-old Miami native is the franchise's all-time leader in receiving yards (9,047) and TD grabs (74), second in catches (609, behind only GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons with 682) and third in all-time touchdowns.\nMitchell earned Grey Cups rings with Toronto (1997) and Edmonton (2005). He finished his CFL career with 821 receptions for 12,014 yards and 90 TDs and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\"This is truly an honour,\" Mitchell said of his all-time Argos selection. \"I was really shocked when I got the call because news like this always catches you off guard.\n\"To find out it was voted upon by my peers was so heartwarming.\"\nOuellette scores 3 TDs as Argonauts improve to 2-0 with win over Elks\nKelly rushes for 3 TDs as defending champion Argonauts beat Tiger-Cats in season opener\nMitchell made an immediate impact with Toronto, earning the CFL's top rookie award in 1997 after registering 77 catches for 1,457 yards and 17 TDs. The Doug Flutie-led Argos finished atop the East Division with a second straight 15-3 record en route to a second straight Grey Cup title that year.\nFlutie left Toronto in the off-season to join the NFL's Buffalo Bills. The club signed veteran Kerwin Bell and although the Argos (9-9) fell to third in the East Division, Bell immediately clicked with Mitchell, who set a CFL single-season record of 160 catches for 2,000 yards and 10 touchdowns.\nMitchell returns to Toronto after stint\u00a0with Edmonton\nSurprisingly, Mitchell was released by Toronto after the '03 season but quickly signed with Edmonton. Over three seasons, Mitchell had 212 catches for 2,967 yards and 16 touchdowns and helped the franchise win a Grey Cup in 2005.\nAfter being released by Edmonton before the '07 season, Mitchell returned to Toronto, recording 25 catches for 366 yards and a TD. On July 26 during a home game against Montreal, Mitchell hauled in an Allen pass to break Paul Masotti's club record of 8,772 career receiving yards.\n\"Those were some special years, some special moments,\" Mitchell said. \"I give all of my former teammates all of the credit because they all made the CFL game so easy for me, they taught me this game.\n\"I was blessed just to be around a bunch of unselfish guys who'd give up their own plays to put me in positions to have success on the field.\"\nWATCH | Allen elected into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame:\nCanada's Sports Hall of Fame's Class of 2018: Damon Allen\n5 years ago\nDuration \n7:01\nCBC Sports' Scott Russell interviews Canada's Sports Hall of Fame's Class of 2018 member Damon Allen.\nMitchell said being inducted Monday with Allen will be special for him and he wonders what more the two could've accomplished had they played together longer.\n\"I think it would've been special because we understood the game, we understood defences, we understood philosophies and what defences were trying to take away,\" Mitchell said. \"It would've been something to see had we been able to hook up earlier in our careers.\"\nComing to Canada\nMitchell's success in Canada came despite knowing little about the CFL after joining the Argos.\n\"I'd caught a couple of games [on TV] growing up just loving the game of football,\" he said. \"When I was released by the Saints [New Orleans drafted Mitchell in 1995], I told my agent, 'Hey man, I want to play football. Do you have any connections in Canada?'\n\"He knew [then Argos GM]\u00a0Eric Tillman and within a day or two I had a contract and I signed it and came to Canada in '97 knowing absolutely nothing about the game. Pinball and [late former Argos receiver]\u00a0DK Smith taught me about the running start and how to time it and Doug was also in my ear teaching me how to avoid any defender who was in my face and he'd look him off and here would come that ball.\"\nArgonauts dethrone Blue Bombers to win 1st Grey Cup title since 2017\nMore CFL coverage\nMitchell said he never wanted to leave Toronto but remains thankful he could finish his career with the Argos.\n\"It was like that storybook ending for me,\" he said. \"Even when it ended in '07, I felt like I still have more football in me but I was so appreciative of Pinball and the organization bringing me back and just giving me an opportunity.\"\nAfter his playing career ended, Mitchell spent time in Edmonton as a receivers coach. He's currently the president of the Elks alumni association and works in the Alberta city as a team leader running two residential homes for Indigenous youths.\nRecord-breaking career for Allen\nAllen, 59, spent the final five seasons of his illustrious 23-year CFL career with Toronto (2003-07). The veteran quarterback led the Argos to their 15th Grey Cup title in '04, earning MVP honours after passing for 299 yards and a touchdown while scoring twice in a 27-19 victory over the B.C. Lions.\nThe following season, the six-foot-one, 180-pound Allen was named the CFL's outstanding player after throwing for a career-high 5,082 yards and 33 TDs. He's one of three Argos to crack the 5,000-yard passing plateau \u2014 Flutie did it twice (5,720 in 1996, 5,505 in '97) and Ricky Ray (5,546 in 2017).\nWATCH | Allen passes advice on to next generation:\nLegendary quarterback Damon Allen now passing advice to the next generation\n2 years ago\nDuration \n11:32\nThe American quarterback re-wrote the CFL record books and was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. Now settled in Mississauga, Ont., Damon Allen is supporting the next generation of athletes, and multiple charities.\nAllen retired after the '07 season as pro football's all-time passing leader with 72,381 yards. He remains fourth overall behind retired NFL stars Tom Brady (89,214) and Drew Brees (80,358) and Anthony Calvillo (79,816), currently the Montreal Alouettes offensive coordinator/quarterback coach.\nAllen threw for 13,974 yards with Toronto, leaving him third all-time behind Ray (20,205) and Condredge Holloway (16,619).\nAllen also played for Edmonton (1985-88, 93-94), Ottawa (1989-91), Hamilton (1992), Memphis (1995) and B.C. (1996-02). The four-time Grey Cup champion went into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2012.",

Jake Julien picked up a single for the Elks with a deep punt to round out the scoring.\nWard added a 41-yard field goal to make it 19-6 in the opening minute of the fourth quarter and later added a second offensive touchdown when Demontre Tuggle ran the ball in nine yards for his first career TD.

He defeated Julio Rodriguez 21-20 in the semifinals after the Mariners star hit a record 41 in the first round in front of his hometown fans.\nBatting against Blue Jays manager John Schneider, Guerrero was the last semifinalist to swing and the first finalist, setting a final round record for homers to top the mark Pete Alonso set when he beat Guerrero 23-22 in 2019.\nWith Guerrero Jr. catching his breath while watching, Arozarena hit against Tampa Bay field coordinator Tomas Francisco. Arozarena had 21 homers in his initial 2 minutes. He had 23 with 7 seconds left in his automatic 30 seconds of bonus time before lining and popping up on his final four swings.\nGuerrero had 1 minute of bonus time, earning an additional 30 seconds because he twice reached 440 feet.\n\"Obviously, the power that he has was incredible,\" Arozarena said through a translator. \"For me, I felt good going into that round.

Arozarena overcame Luis Robert of the Chicago White Sox 35-22 in the semifinals. Robert hit the longest drive of the night, a 484-foot shot to left in the second round. That topped the high of 476 feet by Barry Bonds in the 2001 derby in Seattle.\nTrying to become the youngest Derby winner at age 22, Rodriguez knocked out Alonso, a two-time champion who hit 21. Rodriguez beat Corey Seager 32-24 in the first round last year at Dodger Stadium, then knocked out Alonso 31-23 before losing to Juan Soto 19-18 in the final.\nOMG !!\n&mdash;\n@VladGuerrero27\nArozarena beat Texas' Adolis Garcia 24-17 in the opening pairing before a crowd of 46,952 at T-Mobile Park. Garcia is the godfather to Arozarena's daughter, and the two jumped into each other's arms during warmups.\nRobert knocked out Baltimore's Adley Rutschman 28-27 in the opening round. Rutschman hit 21 left-handed, and the switch hitter then turned around to the right side and hit six more right-handed during a 30-second bonus round. From Portland, Oregon, Rutschman grew up attending Mariners games.\nGuerrero, back for the first time in four years, defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers' Mookie Betts 26-11 in the first round. Four years ago at Cleveland, Guerrero hit 29 in the first round and 40 in the second, then lost to Alonso in the final.\nAlonso was trying for his third title in four years. Griffey Jr. is the only three-time winner, taking the title in 1994, '98 and `99.\nGuerrero Sr. was a nine-time All-Star but never won a World Series. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018.\nGuerrero Jr. is a three-time All-Star and was MVP of the game two years ago in Denver. What's in the future? A World Series ring? Joining dad in the Hall?\n\"I'm a little bit too young to think about that right now,\" he said. \"When I get there, then I'll think about it, I'll see if I match my dad or was better than my dad or not.\"",

        "title": "The Blue Jays face a tough battle in the second half",
        "summary": "CBC Sports' daily newsletter offers a casual fan's update on how the Toronto Blue Jays are doing at the all-star break.",
        "content": "This is an excerpt from The Buzzer, which is CBC Sports' daily email newsletter.\u00a0\nStay up to speed on what's happening in sports by subscribing here\n.\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. put on a show in last night's Home Run Derby in Seattle, bashing nearly 30,000 feet worth of dingers to make himself and Vladimir Sr. (2007) the first father-son duo to\u00a0\nwin the annual All-Star competition\n.\nVladdy's victory was a bright spot in a mixed bag of a season for his Toronto Blue Jays. With the unofficial second half of the season set to begin after tonight's All-Star Game, here's a casual fan's update on some of the storylines surrounding Canada's only Major League Baseball club:\nThe AL East is a beast.\nLife in this division is never easy. This year, it's downright unfair. In a sport where all six divisions have at least one bottom-feeder, each of the five AL East clubs is at least five games over .500. Division-leading Tampa Bay (58-35) has the second-best record in all of baseball and the top run differential. Even last-place Boston ranks a respectable 15th overall in the majors.\nBut the Blue Jays are making headway. Since late May, when they were last in the division, the Jays have clawed their way past the Red Sox and the big-spending Yankees, who won the AL East last year. Toronto (50-41) is still a distant seven games behind Tampa Bay and trails second-place Baltimore (the AL wild card leader) by five. But the Jays currently occupy one of the three AL wild-card spots, putting them on track to reach the post-season for the third time in four years.\nThere's not much room for error over the second half, though. World Series champion Houston is tied with Toronto for the second wild card, while the Yankees and Boston are just one and two games behind, respectively. To stay ahead in the race, the Jays may have to improve their dismal 7-20 record against AL East opponents.\nWhat happened to Guerrero's power?\nLast night's Derby binge notwithstanding, the young star's slugging numbers have been in sharp decline since his breakthrough 2021 season, when he led the majors with 48 home runs and finished second in AL MVP voting. In 2022, Guerrero regressed to 32 homers while also seeing significant dips in every other key batting stat\u00a0\u2014 most notably his slugging percentage, which plummeted from an AL-high .601 in his near-MVP season to .480.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HRDerby?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HRDerby</a> champ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/27vladdyjr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@27vladdyjr</a> made hitting moonshots look easy last night! \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8<br><br>(MLB x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlecloud?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GoogleCloud</a>) <a href=\"https://t.co/Wakr8nRF3W\">pic.twitter.com/Wakr8nRF3W</a>\n&mdash;\n@MLBStats\nThis year, the 24-year-old first baseman's slugging percentage is down to .443 and he's on pace for fewer than 25 homers. Toronto's stadium renovations, which included alterations to the outfield fences, could be partly to blame as the Rogers Centre has been a below-average park for hitters this season. But Guerrero's dwindling power is a troubling trend and it's fair to wonder whether 2021, not 2022, was the real aberration.\nBo Bichette is the Jays' best hitter.\nDespite standing two inches shorter and weighing more than 50 pounds less than Guerrero, Bichette has packed a lot more punch this season. Toronto's other young cornerstone leads the team in homers (15), slugging percentage (.496) and batting average (.317)\u00a0\u2014 all while manning a premium defensive position as the team's everyday shortstop.\nAlek Manoah made it back.\nThe massive young right-hander seemed headed for big things after going 16-7 with a 2.24 ERA last season to earn a finalist nod for the AL Cy Young Award. But Toronto's opening day starter struggled out of the gate, winning just one of his 13 starts while posting a hideous 6.36 ERA and issuing an astounding 42 walks in 58 innings.\nIn early June, the Jays finally decided they'd had enough and sent the 25-year-old all the way down to the Florida Complex League \u2014 the lowest rung on the minor-league ladder\u00a0\u2014 to work out the kinks. After an awful first outing in which he allowed 11 runs while recording just eight outs against a Yankees affiliate made up of mostly teenage prospects, Manoah righted the ship and earned promotion back to the big club last Friday. The reboot seemed to work, as he allowed just one run and five hits over six innings while striking out eight Detroit Tigers and walking none to earn his first big-league win in three months.\nElsewhere in the rotation, strikeout artist Kevin Gausman is pitching at an ace level again this season, Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos has rebounded nicely from a miserable year and pricey free-agent acquisition Chris Bassitt has been so-so. Canadian closer Jordan Romano leads the majors with 26 saves.\nPitching help could arrive soon as 2020 Cy Young finalist Hyun Jin Ryu is now making minor-league rehab starts as part of his comeback from Tommy John surgery.\nThe new-look dome is a crowd-pleaser.\nThe Jays spent much of the off-season hyping a $300-million renovation of the Rogers Centre aimed at turning the largely charmless concrete dome \"from a stadium to a ballpark,\" in the words of team president Mark Shapiro. The investment seems to be paying off, as the\u00a0\naverage attendance\n\u00a0at Jays home games has climbed to nearly 36,000\u00a0\u2014 an increase of more than 5,000 fans per game.\nSome of the boost can probably be attributed to baseball's new pitch clock and other pace-quickening rules changes, which have been a hit with fans everywhere. The fact that the pandemic is now behind us could be playing a role as well. Majors-wide, attendance is up by about 2,300 fans per game.\nBut, even in that context, the Jays' gains at the turnstiles are impressive. Only Philadelphia, coming off a surprising run to the World Series, and Cleveland, defending its first division title in four years, have seen bigger attendance increases this season.",

I don't know if it's going to need surgery or not. We'll know in the next couple of days, I guess.

Angels manager Phil Nevin and a trainer came out to check on the slugger and he left the game.\n\"I kind of knew it wasn't good.

He raced into left field to catch Bichette's fly ball with left fielder Matt Vierling shifted to left centre field.\n\"You have to tip your cap to good pitching and some great defence,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \"Javi made a great play on Bo's ball and Carpenter made the catch on Vladdy. That's usually what happens \u2014 you have good pitching backed up by some good plays.\"\nMore MLB coverage\nThe start of the game was delayed an hour and 22 minutes by rain and a hard shower fell in the first inning.\n\"I think that helped me a lot \u2014 battling through adversity early like that,\" said Manning, who started the game by hitting Bichette and walking Belt. \"I got into rhythm with Haase and it felt really good.\"\nHaase also caught Turnbull's no-hitter.\n\"About the sixth inning, you start counting outs,\" he said. \"Matt was keeping them uncomfortable and then Foley came in and shut the door before Lange did what he does.\"\nThe Tigers lost 12-2 to the Blue Jays on Friday.\n\"Our approach at the plate was whatever we didn't do last night,\" Haase said. \"That's baseball \u2014 we got our teeth kicked in last night and get a combined no-hitter today.\"",

        "content": "Since arriving in the big leagues six years ago, Domingo Germ\u00e1n has been anything but perfect.\nUntil now.\nThe New York Yankees right-hander pitched the 24th perfect game in major league history Wednesday night, retiring every Oakland batter in an 11-0 victory over the Athletics.\nIt was the first perfect game since Seattle Mariners ace Felix Hernandez threw one against the Tampa Bay Rays on Aug. 15, 2012. There were three that season \u2014 but none since until Germ\u00e1n finished the first no-hitter in the majors this year.\nHe joined Don Larsen (1956), David Wells (1998) and David Cone (1999) as Yankees to pitch perfect games. Larsen's gem came in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\"So exciting,\" Germ\u00e1n said through a translator. \"When you think about something very unique in baseball, not many people have an opportunity to pitch a perfect game. To accomplish something like this in my career is something that I'm going to remember forever.\"\nGerm\u00e1n. HISTORY! <a href=\"https://t.co/ktEZbxZNIo\">pic.twitter.com/ktEZbxZNIo</a>\n&mdash;\n@Yankees\nComing off a pair of terrible starts, Germ\u00e1n (5-5) struck out nine of 27 batters against the A's, who have the worst record in the majors.\nThe 30-year-old Germ\u00e1n, a six-year veteran, served a 10-game suspension in May after getting ejected from a game in Toronto for using an illegal sticky substance on the mound. He had never thrown a complete game in the big leagues before.\nWinless in six previous outings against Oakland, Germ\u00e1n threw 72 of 99 pitches for strikes. He mixed 51 curveballs and 30 fastballs that averaged 92.5 mph with 17 changeups and one sinker.\nDomingo Germ\u00e1n struck out 1/3 of the batters he faced. <a href=\"https://t.co/XNKUTxphtO\">pic.twitter.com/XNKUTxphtO</a>\n&mdash;\n@MLB\nHe went to three balls on a batter just twice, falling behind Ryan Noda 3-1 in the fourth and Jonah Bride by the same count in the eighth. Noda struck out on consecutive curveballs, and Germ\u00e1n followed with three straight curves to Bride: one for a called strike, the next resulting in a foul ball and the third in a groundout.\n\"It was just so fun to watch him do that and go to work. We've seen him flirt with outings like that over time,\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said, thinking to when Boston's Alex Verdugo broke up Germ\u00e1n's no-hit bid in the eighth in July 2021.\n\"When he gets rolling like that he's just so fun to watch at his craft because he's so good at commanding all of his pitches. His curveball was great tonight, but because his changeup and his fastball were good, too, it made that curveball even more special.\"\nWith the crowd of 12,479 on its feet for the ninth inning, Germ\u00e1n finished what he started. He got Aledmys Diaz to ground out before Shea Lanegeliers flied out to short centre\u00a0field. When Esteury Ruiz grounded out to third baseman Josh Donaldson to end it, the Yankees' dugout and bullpen emptied as Germ\u00e1n's teammates raced out to the mound to celebrate.\nDomingo Germ\u00e1n, middle, poses with the rest of the Yankees after his perfect game.\n \n(Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez/The Associated Press)\n\"That last inning was very different \u2014 very different. I felt an amount of pressure that I've never felt before,\" Germ\u00e1n said. \"I'm trying to visualize what I want to execute there. At the same time, I don't want to miss. So much pressure, but yet so rewarding.\n\"The key there was not to overthrow,\" he added. \"I was feeling the pressure in that inning but at the same time I wanted to not overthrow, keep that same focus from the first inning, understand the lanes of attack we were using during the game and keep executing.\"\nMore MLB coverage\nSix days after allowing a career-high 10 runs (eight earned) and four homers over 3 1/3 innings in a loss to the Mariners at home, Germ\u00e1n got his 500th career strikeout and was the definition of perfection.\nIt was the 13th no-hitter in Yankees history, including Larsen's perfect game in the World Series. Corey Kluber pitched their previous no-hitter against the Texas Rangers on May 19, 2021.\n\"I'm just happy for Domingo. He's had a rough last couple starts and he's kind of been dragging a little bit,\" Yankees catcher Kyle Higashioka said. \"I kind of always felt like of anyone, he has a really good chance to do something like this and for it all to come together tonight is just amazing.\"\nOh, what a night! <a href=\"https://t.co/PRFuG7Be2o\">pic.twitter.com/PRFuG7Be2o</a>\n&mdash;\n@Yankees\nIt marked quite a personal turnaround for Germ\u00e1n, who went 18-4 in 2019 with the Yankees but was put on administrative leave late that season while Major League Baseball investigated an alleged domestic violence incident involving his girlfriend.\nHe missed the entire pandemic-shortened 2020 season and playoffs while serving an 81-game suspension for the incident, then met face-to-face with Yankees teammates and made a public apology at spring training when he returned to the team in February 2021.\nSeth Brown came the closest to reaching base for the A's, hitting a sharp grounder in the fifth to first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who made a diving stop and tossed to Germ\u00e1n for the out.\nGerm\u00e1n\u00a0was loudly cheered as the game unfolded. Many fans in Oakland were decked out in Yankees colours or jerseys.\n\"Unfortunately, two days ago an uncle of mine passed away and I cried a lot yesterday in the clubhouse. So I had him with me throughout the whole game. I was thinking about him,\" Germ\u00e1n said. \"This game is a tribute to him. He would have been so happy. He was always someone that really brought a joy to our family and it happened for him to watch it this way, from up there.\"",

We were all competitors and everyone wanted to win, of course, so maybe that left the biggest impact on some people,\" he said.\n \nTo be able to play professional basketball in the city that I played college in and grew to love, it was like a dream come true for me.\n\u2014 Logan Rempel\nBut despite the complications, Rempel said he would sign up for a second season in a heartbeat.\n\"I'll be one of the first players in line.

The WNBA named her an honourary starter, with every player wearing her No. 42 jersey in the second half of last year's game.\nThis time Griner was actually in the starting lineup \u2014 the only one with that jersey number \u2014 overshadowing almost everything that happened on the court.\nTeam Stewart made Griner the focal point from the beginning. She delivered a dunk with 3:50 remaining in the first quarter off an outlet pass from Stewart. Griner also had a dunk just 25 seconds into the second half.\n\"I called my knees and talked to them and gave them a little pep talk,\" the 32-year-old Griner said of her dunks.\nBrittney Griner's 9 all-star selections most of any of the 2023 starters\nTeam Wilson bests Team Stewart in WNBA all-star game as teams show support for Brittney Griner\nGriner at one point in the first quarter challenged Team Wilson point guard Chelsea Gray of the Aces, but Gray drove past the nine-time all-star from the Phoenix Mercury and dropped in a reverse layup from high off the glass.\nAt the first media timeout, Griner was shown on the video board as she sat on the bench with the words, \"WELCOME BACK BRITTNEY GRINER\" on the screen below her face.\nGriner was among the players who wore microphones during the game, joking after missing a 3-pointer that she \"got something in my eye.\"\nTHE <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ATT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ATT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WNBAAllStar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WNBAAllStar</a> Game missed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brittneygriner?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@brittneygriner</a> so much but she\u2019s BACKKKK \ud83d\udcaa<br><br>Welcoming BG to the floor for Team Stewart <a href=\"https://t.co/kcnXA9tunw\">pic.twitter.com/kcnXA9tunw</a>\n&mdash;\n@WNBA\nThe game was played with a 20-second shot clock rather than the usual 24, two four-point spots on each side of the court were added and there were no free throws.

The all-star squad beat the U.S. team that year 93-83.\nThe exhibition contest would give the Olympians a marquee event on home soil before heading to Paris.\nTaurasi has said she hopes to play in Paris and lead the U.S. to an eighth consecutive gold medal and earn her sixth. Taurasi is signed with the Mercury through next season, which would be her 20th in the league.\nEx-NBA star Dwyane Wade joins ownership group of hometown Chicago Sky\nMore basketball coverage\nPlaying in Phoenix, which also hosted the all-star game in 2000 and 2014, would give Griner a chance to play in front of the Mercury fans as well. Griner, who is a nine-time all-star, said she would love to play in the Paris Olympics if asked.\n\"I'm lucky enough for it to be coming back again,\" she said after dominating in her return to the all-star game on Saturday. \"I know Phoenix and the Mercury organization are going to put on one hell of an all-star. To play there in front of our fans, the city is going to come out, everyone's going to turn up. It's going to be a real good time.\"\nEngelbert said that Taurasi's potential finale and Griner's return weren't big reasons in awarding the game to Phoenix.\n\"Those weren't factors, but those are nice to have as part of the storyline next year with it being an Olympic year,\" she said.",

The AP also left a message seeking comment from the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\nA representative for USC outside the Galen Center on Tuesday said the school would not have a briefing or issue a statement about James' health scare.\nLeBron James switching back from No. 6 to No. 23 'out of respect' for late Bill Russell\nNBA, NBPA retiring Bill Russell's No. 6 across the league\nBronny James announced in May that he would play college basketball for the Trojans, whose campus is less than two miles from the downtown arena of his father's Los Angeles Lakers. USC's basketball team is holding off-season practices in preparation for a two-week European tour next month.\nHis father is the leading scorer in NBA history and a four-time champion, but Bronny James is an elite talent in his own right, establishing himself as one of the nation's top point guard recruits before he chose the Trojans late in the commitment cycle.\nBuffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who suffered cardiac arrest during an NFL game last season, tweeted his support: \"Prayers to Bronny & The James Family as well [prayer emoji]\u00a0here for you guys just like you have been for me my entire process.\"\nDamar Hamlin shared a message of support for the James family. <a href=\"https://t.co/OjRSHbEefx\">pic.twitter.com/OjRSHbEefx</a>\n&mdash;\n@SportsCenter\nSports figures across the world also sent messages of support. Jayson Tatum, Trae Young and Donovan Mitchell were among many NBA stars tweeting prayers for James, while former Lakers forward Metta Sandiford-Artest wrote: \"Prayers for Bronny. What a great kid. Come back stronger young fella. Get better and feel better.\"\nBronny James was stricken just over a year after USC freshman 7-footer Vincent Iwuchukwu collapsed during a practice. Iwuchukwu not only survived but returned to play for the Trojans in the second half of the season.\nWith his family fame and huge social media following, Bronny James has the top name, image and likeness valuation in sports at $6.3 million, On3.com estimates.\nLeBron James has spoken frequently about his desire to play a season in the NBA with Bronny, the first of his three children with his wife, Savannah. The elder James recently confirmed he will play his 21st NBA season in the fall with the Lakers, his home since 2018.\nMore NBA coverage\nRecord-setting skier Mikaela Shiffrin wins ESPY award for best athlete in women's sports\nBronny's decision to stay close to home was a coup for USC, which is expected to have one of college basketball's most compelling teams next season after making its third straight NCAA Tournament appearance last March.\nBronny, whose name is LeBron James Jr., was one of the top college prospects in the country last season as a star two-way guard at Sierra Canyon School in suburban Chatsworth. His younger brother, 16-year-old Bryce, played at Sierra Canyon last season before transferring to Campbell Hall School in Studio City for the upcoming high school season.\nIwuchukwu, one of the nation's top college basketball prospects a year ago, went into cardiac arrest on July 1, 2022, with athletic trainers using an automated external defibrillator to revive him. Iwuchukwu had a battery-powered pulse generator known as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implanted in his chest, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nIwuchukwu made his Trojans debut Jan. 12 and eventually appeared in 14 games, including five starts. He will return this season to USC, which is expected to have a powerhouse team.",

In Game 7, Brown had 19 points on 8-of-23 shooting, making just one of nine 3-point attempts.\nStill, the totality of his time in Boston has made him a key piece of the franchise's current core that management wasn't willing to risk seeing depart when his current four-year deal expires after next season.\nBy virtue of making the All-NBA second team \u2014 Brown's first such honour in his career \u2014 he was eligible for the supermax extension.\nNBA Board of Governors approves Michael Jordan's sale of Hornets: reports\nBronny James, son of NBA great LeBron James, in stable condition after suffering cardiac arrest\nFrom the moment this past season ended, Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens has been adamant that he wanted to see Brown sign a long-term deal.\n\"He's a big part of us. We believe in him and I'm thankful for him,\" Stevens said last month. \"I'm really thankful that when those guys have success they come back to work. And when they get beat, they own it and they come back to work. And so I know that's what they're about.

And he's accomplished a lot so far in his career. So, I think it's extremely important.\"\nBrown's new pact will likely lead to some financial manoeuvring down the road with the league's new Collective Bargaining Agreement bringing more limitations on how teams construct their rosters and additional luxury tax penalties.\nTatum is still playing under his rookie extension that kicked in last season and will be eligible for his potential supermax extension next summer.",

        "content": "WNBA expansion seems to always be a topic of discussion around the league.\nIt happens during the off-season, around the preseason and the draft, and it always comes up at commissioner Cathy Engelbert's state of the league news conference at the all-star game.\n'Toronto wants WNBA': First-ever game in Canada shows viability of expansion to Toronto\nThis past weekend was no different. As the WNBA tips off the second half of its season, add expansion to the list of topics on the minds of players and the league.\nFor several years, Engelbert has said the league would expand when the time was right and the 12 current teams were in good standing financially. The league hasn't had an expansion franchise since Atlanta in 2008. Both Las Vegas and Dallas were existing franchises that relocated.\nWhile no specific cities have been named as possible expansion locations, Engelbert mentioned the success of the preseason game in Toronto between Chicago and Minnesota that drew nearly 20,000 fans.\n\"We were thrilled with the outcome there,\" she said. \"We're still talking about it. There's still a lot of buzz, and we appreciate our counterparts in Canada making it so successful.\"\nBut Engelbert says it's not just picking the right cities. What's more important is finding ownership groups that would be a good fit for the league. Las Vegas owner Mark Davis has been a welcome addition, investing in the defending champion Aces, including building a new state-of-the-art practice facility.\nDuring all-star weekend, Engelbert said the league should have some expansion news later this season.\n\"Our conversations with potential ownership groups are headed in the right direction,\" the commissioner said.\nWATCH | Canada's Carleton discusses playing at home:\nBridget Carleton of the Minnesota Lynx on the first-ever WNBA game in Toronto\n2 months ago\nDuration \n8:54\nHost Anastasia Bucsis talks with Canadian WNBA player Bridget Carleton about the first-ever WNBA in Toronto and how this game can help inspire the next generation of Canadian basketball players.\nWhile the league is looking for the right ownership groups, players aren't so quick to want expansion, feeling there are other things that the league should be focused on such as travel and salary benefits.\n\"I feel like we have some holes that we can work on currently,\" said Aces guard Kelsey Plum, who is the first vice president of the WNBA Players Association. \"We can do a better job of figuring out ways to fix some of the current issues we have coming up.\"\nPlum knows the league needs to expand its footprint, but believes players need to be treated better first.\n\"I understand expansion is important, I understand growing the league, I understand growing in cities, and I do think that's something to come,\" Plum said. \"I don't think that should take precedence over charter flights. I don't think that should take precedence over salary benefits.\"",

Some rolled onto their backs for belly-rubs as their owners returned after being separated for a week due to an evacuation notice in the Cree community\u00a0of Eastmain.\u00a0\nYoung Claveau, the animal control officer for the village of about 900, was relieved to see the \"joyful reunion\" on Thursday as nearly 60 dogs were reunited with their families. More would be reunited over the days to come.\u00a0\n\"I think everyone got emotional to see their dogs back knowing that [we were] this close \u2014 that the whole community would be gone in flames.\"\u00a0\nA week earlier, the village, located over 1,200 kilometres northwest of Quebec City, was among those evacuated due to forest fires and wildfire smoke.\u00a0\nVulnerable members of Cree communities in northern Quebec asked to evacuate due to wildfire smoke\nInitially, the dogs were supposed to be transported on the military helicopters after the 3-phase evacuation plan for residents. But when the neighbouring community of Wemindji also declared a state of emergency, the helicopters were diverted there.\n\"When they dropped off their dog, some people cried because they didn't want to leave \u2026 but they didn't really have a choice,\" said Marilyn Tomatuk, a volunteer who stayed behind to help.\nBo, left, and Bear, right, were among the dogs crated and prepped to leave by helicopter.\n \n(Submitted by Marilyn Tomatuk)\nThe Eastmain dogs, all in their crates, set to travel, instead watched as the helicopter flew away.\n\"When we saw them fly away, we weren't too sure about if we could depend on them anymore,\" said Claveau.\n\"We weren't depressed, but we were disappointed, that's for sure. We were kind of disappointed that the animals would be left behind.\"\nClaveau said he and two volunteers, Tomatuk and Soleil Brown, stayed\u00a0behind.\u00a0\n\"I understand that human life comes first, but I think at this point it sheds some light on how we have to stick together and find ways to be able to protect our pets,\" said Claveau.\nMiihiikin, the Cree word for wolf, was cared for by the volunteers. \n \n(Submitted by Marilyn Tomatuk)\n'I didn't realize what I was getting myself into'\nClaveau said caring for 80 dogs with different health, exercise and social needs was a challenge.\u00a0\n\"There was so much work to do, we had to do stuff that we never did before. Like I had to mix some baby milk made for dogs \u2026 I had to feed that to the puppies,\" said Claveau.\n\"With all this smoke they became really thirsty really quickly. So the first thing we would do is when we wake up is go give them a lot of water. And we had to ration our food.\"\nTomatuk says it was overwhelming for such a small team.\n\"I didn't realize what I was getting myself into,\" said Tomatuk with a laugh. \"Everything was just very chaotic.\"\nLISTEN\u00a0| Animal control officer describes staying behind to care for 80 dogs:\nQuebec AM\n10:17\nKeep the dogs safe\nWhen the people of the Cree Nation of Eastmain had to leave their community in a hurry a few days ago, because of encroaching forest fires, they had to leave their dogs behind. CBC journalist Rachel Watts spoke with Eastmain's animal control officer Young Claveau.\n'I would do it the same way all over again'\nOnce the helicopters were gone, Claveau says he started thinking about how he could get the dogs out if the fires started approaching.\n\"I'm part of an animal control group across the Cree communities and we all face the same decisions \u2026 We weren't part of the evacuation plan to get reimbursed by Indigenous Service Canada,\" said Claveau.\u00a0\n\"I did over 100 phone calls. I'm not even kidding,\" said Claveau.\u00a0\nOne of his evacuation ideas \u2014 which he admits was \"almost insane\" \u2014 was to transport the dogs out by motor boat.\u00a0\n\"[Boats] are really fast and we could probably bring their dogs to an island.,\" said Claveau.\nClaveau was in contact with a U.S. donor who had offered to pay for flights out \u2014 six flights costing $50,000.\u00a0\nHis last resort was to lure the dogs away from the fire, if it started coming their way.\n\"The Plan C was really if it was if we see flames in town, it would be to put the food by the water and just unleash all the dogs so that they have a standing chance.\"\u00a0\nThe community of Eastmain was under an devacuation notice on July 13. Harley was among the dogs who couldn't board the helicopter.\n \n(Submitted by Marilyn Tomatuk)\nIn the end, none of the dramatic rescue plans were needed.\nThe smoke and wildfire conditions improved, allowing the residents to return.\u00a0\nFires, smoke in Cree territory make for scary travel\nSmoke descended upon some of the Cree territories as the province battled a particularly tough wildfire season.  \n \n(Submitted by Marilyn Tomatuk)\nClaveau says after the evacuation notice was lifted, the reunions of the dogs and their owners took place over the course of two days.\n\"It was something beautiful to see,\" he said. \"There's a lot of tears.\"\nClaveau doesn't regret his decision to stay behind.\n\"I would say we learned a lot and I would do it the same way all over again if it had to happen,\" he said as his dog, Nouchimi, barked in the background. \"He's agreeing.\"",

Just signing a declaration with the same content wouldn't be enough.\nRussia threatens fencing boycott after Olympic champions excluded from competition\nIn exchange, democratic countries should be ready to offer them and their families asylum and safety. Ha\u0161ek also floated the idea of creating team of refugees \u2014 a common practice at recent Olympics \u2014 because accepting them on Russia's terms would signal approval of the invasion.\n\"It's an unbelievable promotion of the Russian war and it costs a lot of lives,\" he said. \"It's necessary we stop it.\"\nHa\u0161ek has been invited to visit the European Parliament next month to present his views.\n\"I can't predict what impact it might have but I want to do the best possible job to convince them, and then they can go on to convince others,\" he said.\n'The NHL is still in my heart'\nHa\u0161ek has been proposing the exclusion of the athletes since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022 and appealed particularly to the NHL and the two tennis tours in an open letter to take part in it. That has not happened.\nHe is particularly disappointed with the reaction of the NHL and commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\"Of course, I'm really sad about it because the NHL is still in my heart,\" said Ha\u0161ek, who was known as the Dominator during his NHL career.\nHa\u0161ek won six Vezina Trophies as the league's top goalie, and twice won the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player \u2014 the only goalie to win the award twice \u2014 during a nine-year stint with the Buffalo Sabres.\nHe later helped the Detroit Red Wings win the Stanley Cup in 2002 and 2008 and led the Czechs to the Olympic gold in 1998. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2014.\nRussians return to judo competition at worlds while Ukraine boycotts\nHe proposed to Bettman that the NHL should pay off the contracts the Russian players signed as a way of banning them. Otherwise, he said, the NHL is partially responsible for what's going on in Ukraine.\nHe said he would demand the league contributes a significant amount of money for Ukraine's post-war renovation.\n\"It wouldn't be just a few million but a large share of its income,\" he said. \"My goal is not to harm the NHL but to make it pay for its behaviour.\"\nHa\u0161ek said tennis and other sports governing bodies accepting the Russians should do the same because \"they support the Russian war.\"\nOlympic head slams criticism of planned Russian reintegration as 'deplorable'\nHa\u0161ek said he personally is not in favour of boycotting the Paris Olympics because he doesn't want to deprive the athletes of their Olympic dreams.\nHe said the last chance to stop the Russians and \"save a lot of lives\" will be in the hands of France, noting that as host country it has the power to deny them entry.\nIn early June, Ha\u0161ek spent five days in Ukraine, including in Kyiv and Kharkiv and in the towns of Irpin and Bucha that are recovering from a brutal occupation by Russian forces.\nHis aim was to express his support for the country in its fight against Russian aggression and encourage the local hockey community, including youth players, when a half of all ice rinks in the war-torn country are unavailable.\nHa\u0161ek has dismissed the critics who say sports should not be mixed with politics, noting countries use their successful athletes to achieve their goals.\n\"That's been common and there's nothing wrong about it until a state is engaged in killing and murdering and the athletes become a propaganda tool for it,\" Ha\u0161ek said. \"That's the case of the Russian and Belarusian athletes.

He was 70.\nThe team\u00a0said in a release that Wirtz died on Tuesday, calling it a \"sudden passing.\" No further details were provided.\n\"Our hearts are very heavy today,\"\u00a0CEO Danny Wirtz, Rocky's son, said on Twitter. \"Our dad was a passionate businessman committed to making Chicago a great place to live, work and visit, but his true love was for his family and close friends. His passing leaves a huge hole in the hearts of many and we will miss him terribly.\"\nRocky Wirtz was 2 years old when his grandfather, Arthur Wirtz, purchased the franchise\u00a0in 1954. Rocky Wirtz took over the team after his father, William, died in September 2007.\nWe are deeply saddened to join the Wirtz Family in mourning the sudden passing of our Chairman W. Rockwell \u201cRocky\u201d Wirtz today at the age of 70. <a href=\"https://t.co/WA58pXWl9M\">pic.twitter.com/WA58pXWl9M</a>\n&mdash;\n@NHLBlackhawks\nWilliam Wirtz was nicknamed \"Dollar Bill\" for his frugality when it came to acquiring the services of the game's best players. And the team struggled while playing in front of small crowds in its early years at the United Center, making only one playoff appearance from 1998-2008.\nEverything changed when Rocky Wirtz became the team chairman. He helped re-establish the franchise's connection to some of its best players from the past. He put the team's games back on local TV, and fans returned to the United Center during a lengthy sellout streak that ended in 2021.\n\"The National Hockey League family is deeply saddened by the sudden passing of W. Rockwell 'Rocky' Wirtz,\" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a release. \"Rocky was a native son of Chicago and an accomplished businessman. Rocky took over control of the [club] in 2007 and almost immediately restored the passion and following of this storied, Original Six franchise.\"\nWith Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane leading the way, Chicago\u00a0won the Stanley Cup in 2010, 2013 and 2015. The team also made it to the 2014 Western Conference Final, losing to the Los Angeles Kings in an epic seven-game series.\nWirtz\u00a0soon became a beloved figure in his native Chicago. He also was lauded by the league for his leadership.\nJerry Reinsdorf, who owns the NBA's Chicago Bulls and baseball's White Sox, called Wirtz a great man.\n\"We were far more than partners at the United Center. We were very close; he was a dear friend and our trust, our bond, was unbreakable,\" Reinsdorf said in a release. \"We never had a disagreement or argument during all of our many years together.\n\"Everyone liked Rocky. He was smart, passionate, generous, personable and friendly.\"\nSexual assault scandal\nBut Wirtz's tenure as owner was forever tarnished by the organization's response when a player said he was sexually assaulted by an assistant coach during the team's run to the 2010 Stanley Cup title.\nA review by an outside law firm, commissioned by the team in response to two lawsuits and released in October 2021, found that the franchise badly mishandled Kyle Beach's allegations that he was assaulted by then-video coach Brad Aldrich.\nThe investigation by Jenner & Block found no evidence that either Rocky or Danny Wirtz was aware of the allegations before Beach's lawsuit was brought to their attention ahead of its filing.\nThe team reached a confidential settlement with Beach. Aldrich told investigators for the team's report that his encounter with the player was consensual.\nChicago owner apologizes for response to Kyle Beach talk\nA second suit filed by a former high school student whom Aldrich was convicted of assaulting in Michigan was quietly dismissed \"by stipulation or agreement.\"\nThe NHL fined Chicago\u00a0$2 million US for \"the organization's inadequate internal procedures and insufficient and untimely response,\" and longtime general manager Stan Bowman resigned. Rocky Wirtz also successfully petitioned the Hockey Hall of Fame to have Aldrich's name removed from the Stanley Cup.\nAt a town hall in February 2022, Wirtz angrily rejected any conversation connected to the franchise's response to Beach's allegations. Wirtz apologized for his remarks that same night.",

        "content": "Bayne Pettinger has always been immersed in the world of hockey.\nBorn in Victoria, into\u00a0a family with deep roots in the sport, Pettinger\u00a0embarked on a career with the National Hockey League (NHL) at 21.\nThen, after working for the NHL as an operations manager, he became a hockey agent in 2019.\nDespite his\u00a0professional\u00a0success, however, the 36-year-old says he feared he couldn't be accepted as a gay man in the sport.\n\"There was always this fear that I couldn't live my true life \u2014 to be accepted as a gay man \u2014 and also be a successful young executive in the game. It was a conundrum that kept me in the closet for a long time,\" he wrote in a\u00a0\ncommentary\n\u00a0for Hockey Canada.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Pettinger returned to\u00a0Victoria, where he said he found time for introspection and had candid conversations with friends and family\u00a0about\u00a0publicly coming out as gay.\nWith their support, Pettinger decided to come out to \nThe Athletic,\n a sports news portal, in November 2020.\nAll of us at Hockey Canada are tremendously proud of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/baynep?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@baynep</a> and of the hockey community for the wonderful support they have shown him. We hope Bayne\u2019s courage to share his story inspires others to know that they too will always have a home at the rink.\n&mdash;\n@HockeyCanada\n\u00a0\nHe has since received abundant support from hockey fans and become an advocate for LGBTQ+ representation in sports.\u00a0\nBut a recent incident\u00a0left him disheartened, he says.\nLast month, the NHL's board of governors \ndecided\n\u00a0to prohibit\u00a0special jerseys during pre-game warmups on themed nights in the upcoming season. The\u00a0decision came after a few players refused to wear rainbow-coloured Pride jerseys in\u00a0the previous season.\nWATCH | Handful of NHLers object to wearing Pride-themed jerseys:\n\u00a0\nHandful of NHLers object to wearing Pride-themed jerseys\n4 months ago\nDuration \n2:02\nCanadian NHL players Mark and Eric Staal are the latest to join a handful of others who are refusing to wear Pride-themed warm-up jerseys in support of the LGBTQ community. It\u2019s ignited a debate over inclusivity and personal freedom in pro-hockey.\nNHL commissioner Gary Bettman\u00a0said\u00a0he suggested discontinuing the use of special warmup jerseys because the focus on certain players declining to participate was overshadowing the essence of the themed nights.\n\"That's just become more of a distraction from really the essence of what the purpose of these nights are,\" Bettman said.\n\"We're keeping the focus on the game. And on these specialty nights, we're going to be focused on the cause.\"\nNHL banning 'cause-based' jerseys next season\nDuring an interview with host Jason D'Souza on CBC's \nAll Points West\n, Pettinger shared his thoughts\u00a0on Bettman's comment, coming out, and\u00a0the future of inclusivity in hockey.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nHow are you feeling about the direction of inclusivity through what we've seen around the banning of Pride and warmup jerseys for social causes?\nI didn't like Bettman's words that it's a distraction, because five players in the NHL out of 700 decided not to wear a Pride jersey have that majority vote,\u00a0when it's really the opposite.\nIt's not really asking the players what's right and wrong, and we have ostracized a few of the players for religious beliefs. Everyone has their belief. I'm fine with that. I'm not looking to preach or convert.\nBut if for one night for a 15-minute warmup that raises for charity hundreds of thousands of dollars, then that's where I take issue with it.\u00a0\nFor the league to call it a distraction, 99 per cent of the players in the league don't see it that way and actually embrace it, so I think the league kind of jumped the gun.\nAnalysis\nAs NHL teams, players opt out of Pride Night events, concerns grow about league's commitment to change\nWhat do you think that says about a league like the NHL,\u00a0when you have what is visibly a very small minority of players dictating huge social policy issues?\nI still stay positive about it \u2014 we are still going to do Pride\u00a0nights, there are a lot of teams\u00a0I've talked to that are still gonna do the jerseys but just not wear them in warmup.\u00a0\nPushing fans away to say, you're not welcome here on one night of 82 games,\u00a0gives the wrong message to fans. Banning the jerseys and calling it a distraction is sending the wrong message in my eyes.\nAll Points West\n15:36\nVictoria NHL agent Bayne Pettinger shares his perspective on the prejudice against Pride in the NHL\nThis year the NHL has been mired by opposition to Pride Nights and jerseys. The first openly gay NHL agent, Bayne Pettinger, dropped by the CBC Victoria studio to share his perspective.\nThe NHL has always had this stereotype of being an old boys club, not being able to grow. How damaging is this from an economic standpoint for the league?\nHockey has a way to go on the cultural side, but I don't want it to be that block.\nWe talk about growing the game to have a more diverse fan base, and I just have a tough time agreeing that the decision to ban warmup jerseys is a step-forward direction for inclusivity and sending the right message for a non-hockey fan.\nWe can't even for 15 minutes have a celebration of our differences, which is really what it is.\nWinnipeg LGBTQ advocates disappointed following NHL's decision to ban themed jerseys\nYou are\u00a0the first openly gay NHL agent, and I know you work with many players, but you're also friends with many players in this league. What have you been hearing over the course of the last few weeks and months?\nThey're a bit disheartened by it because they enjoy those [Pride] nights.\nThey're average people putting these hockey players on this pedestal. They're average people who are diverse and inclusive, have sons and daughters, and want to live in a world where there's no hate or discrimination. They're not pleased about it, but we just gotta keep pushing.\nIf I were still in the closet like I was three years ago and seeing that the league banned jerseys, you'd sink a bit deeper in your chair.\u00a0\nJust keeping focused on the positive, because we can go down that rabbit hole of five players of 700 \u2026 that's not a majority.\nNHL player's boycott of team's Pride night tribute 'disrespectful' to gay community: agent\nCan you take us back three years ago to what that was like for you on a personal level, given the role you play in a huge league like the NHL, to come out?\nI had a massive fear that I couldn't be successful in hockey and be gay, because I didn't see anyone before me doing that.\u00a0\nBrendan Burke\n was obviously a role model of mine. I never got the chance to meet him before he passed away shortly after he came out,\u00a0 but I remember watching that SportsCentre interview with James Duthie\u00a0when\u00a0he came out at age 21.\nI said, wow! that's someone like me. I can be an executive in hockey because he trailblazed it.\nI was a young agent in Toronto and how I really started it was floating it around to some of my friends. They said, let's break down these barriers,\u00a0and they gave me strength.\nUnwelcome spotlight falls on NHL team Pride night events\nMy biggest fear was that I couldn't work in hockey and be successful and be gay, but in fact it's been quite the opposite. For people that think they have to choose between living their truth and playing a sport, no one should ever have to do that.\nWe talked about diversity in Canada, and we should have queer seats at tables of boards of directors. If a certain percentage of the population is queer, we need to have those seats at the table of Hockey Canada.\nNHL's Pride nights collide with LGBTQ+ political climate\nEveryone always asked me when we were going to see the first gay NHL player. Well, Luke Prokop, who's a buddy of mine, came out six months after I did \u2014 he saw my story, so he's like, oh, I saw an agent come out right now.\u00a0He has young players reaching out to him saying, \"Hey man, that's so cool! You're signed to the Nashville Predators.\"\nIt's humanization and breaking those barriers down so that a young kid can say, I can do this. There's an agent and a player that are gay and thriving in hockey, so why can't I?\nI thought I had to be living my truth, and in fact it's been the best decision I've ever ever done.\nWATCH\u00a0| Pettinger, Prokop discuss controversy around Pride-themed jerseys last NHL season\n: \n'It's not asking players what's right or wrong': Prokop and Pettinger on NHL Pride nights\n26 days ago\nDuration \n21:08\nLuke Prokop and Bayne Pettinger join Anastasia Bucsis to discuss the controversy that surrounded Pride nights throughout the last NHL season.\nAre you concerned\u00a0these recent steps by the NHL might be those same concerns you had three to four years ago in the minds of those who were thinking maybe they can come out of my locker room, and now perhaps don't feel like they're welcome to?\nWe're not going to look at a Pride jersey ban as \"our work's done here.\" We're going to keep pushing for diversity and inclusion, because that's the way society is going.\u00a0\nIf we want the best players, best executives and best media members available, it's not a great business move to be pushing members of the queer community away from the game.\nWe need to welcome everyone to the game. We need to tap into what Canada really is, which is diversity. If we're excluding that, that just doesn't make sense on a business model.",

We photo-matched it to generally that period of the Cup and then Gretzky actually signed it in his own hand and he dated it May 26, 1988, which was the date of the last championship game.\"\nIt's not the first of Gretzky memorabilia to draw such a big price at auction.\nSask. collector whose Gretzky memorabilia was stolen 'overwhelmed' by hockey community's response\n'Gretzky of Gretzky collectors' gets inked with permanent portrait of hockey hero\nIn May 2021, Heritage Auctions said it sold a 1979 O-Pee-Chee Gretzky rookie card to an anonymous buyer for $3.75 million.\nThat broke its previous record for a hockey card from December 2020 when Heritage sold the only other one of two Gretzky rookie cards to receive a perfect \"gem mint\" score from Professional Sports Authenticator for $1.29 million.\nThat marked the first hockey card to go for more than $1 million.\nThis Wayne Gretzky Edmonton Oilers jersey just sold for a record $1.45M US\nHighlights from the Battle of Alberta in the '80s",

So we're still bringing everything to the table.\"\nShe said the major difference is that people will order at the counter and everything can now be taken out of the restaurant. After being ordered the food can be heated in under 10 minutes and packed up, so people can eat at the restaurant or leave.\n\"Everything is kind of packaged in a way that you can eat here or take it and eat it as a picnic. You can go to the beach, take it with you for later. So\u00a0same kind of menu and same style, but a little bit of a different service when you walk in,\" Hayes said.\nThe Bonavista Social Club reopened in May after a yearlong hiatus.\n \n(Bonavista Social Club)\nThere were a number of factors that led to the changes, explained Hayes. She pointed out that people are feeling more price-conscious over the rising costs of things like groceries.\n\"Everything is\u00a0\u2026\u00a0getting more expensive. Our overhead, we need to be able to control it,\" she said.\nThe business also wanted to keep the menu \"tight\" and is also offering Sicilian style pizza by the slice this year, she said.\nHayes\u00a0said the idea\u00a0is\u00a0to cater to a range of demographics, from families\u00a0to seniors and travellers.\n\"We want to make sure that we can offer something for them to eat and something to take away. So I think that with the prices of everything \u2026 it's going to become more difficult to get things and you know the growing season is a bit later and stuff this year,\" she said.\n\"So I think if we can keep our overhead a little bit smaller it means we can make our dishes and our food more affordable.\"\nA hiatus well spent\nThe Hayes family was not\u00a0idle during the year they kept the restaurant closed.\nHayes said they'd been headhunted by a company to work in western Canada, near\u00a0Kamloops, B.C.\n\"We were doing consulting and working with this company that is starting to do regenerative agriculture,\" she said.\u00a0\"So we were assisting, consulting with the growing, with the processing of ingredients, with putting things away for them for the winter and just learning about the whole process.\"\nThe Bonavista Social Club serves pizza, pasta, moose burgers, sandwiches and more with a new focus on counter service and takeout. \n \n(Bonavista Social Club)\nShe added the timing was\u00a0good because after 10 years with the Bonavista Social Club, the family was\u00a0ready for a break.\nThe pandemic has slowed down business.\n\"The opportunity arose and we jumped at it, and we drove across the country and back with the three kids and the two dogs and we had a really amazing eight months,\" she said.\nProfile\nDouble rise: Chef Katie Hayes takes a step back into the kitchen\n'It's the perfect place for us': Millennials flock to rural Newfoundland\nTaking a step back from the restaurant was also rejuvenating, said Hayes, adding\u00a0it reminded her about the excitement she feels about food.\n\"It reminded us of all the things that we're grateful for,\" she said. \"I definitely feel very refreshed and excited about food again.\"\nListen to the full interview with CBC Radio's \nSt. John's Morning Show\n:\n \nSt John's Morning Show\n7:28\nThe Bonavista Social Club is back\nAfter a decade of baking pizzas and breads they were burnt out and in need of a break.

It said\u00a0all three people on the boat were able to swim back to shore.\nCarlson\u00a0said he saw that\u00a0one of the people, who he says is a woman, safely reached the shore first, standing in waist-deep water, before he began towing the men.\u00a0\n3 boaters rescued from Vancouver Harbour after possible collision with cargo ship, RCMP say\nCarlson said the men, who he estimated to be in their 30s or 40s, should have been aware of the risks of navigating a small boat unsuitable for the turbulent waters near the Overlanders Bridge,\n\"[The area] was pretty sketchy,\" he said. \"That river is always trying to kill you, so be respectful of it.\"\n2 men, 1 dog rescued after boat capsizes off B.C. coast\nBen concurred, stating that the two men made a mistake by going on the water\u00a0at night with no lights on the boat, relying solely on moonlight.\n\"I would not be in a lake boat in the middle of the river at night with no lights [on the boat] \u2014 they were being very dangerous.\"\nChris Carlson, right, and his son, Ben, both said the boaters should have realized the danger of sailing in a choppy water during nighttime with no lights on. \n \n(Jenifer Norwell/CBC)\nIn an emailed statement, Capt. Jamie Chase of Kamloops Fire Rescue stressed the importance of having proper navigation lights when boating after sunset and recommended that occupants wear life jackets at all times while on the water.\nChase also highlighted the following rules that all boaters should follow:\nUndergo basic training in safe boat operation.\nEnsure the vessel is suitable for adverse conditions and not overloaded.\nAvoid operating boats while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.",

        "content": "British Columbia wildfire officials are warning of an uptick in lightning-caused wildfires later this week as the province heads into the hottest, driest stretch of the summer.\nCliff Chapman, operations director for the B.C. Wildfire Service (BCWS), says the lightning that's expected to be \"widespread\" across the province is more likely to hit higher, mountainous terrain, but strikes are also possible in or around communities.\nChapman told a news conference it's still early in the summer and wildfires have already scorched nearly 10,500 square kilometres of land in the province.\nThat represents the third-highest burned area ever recorded in B.C., and Chapman says he believes it's possible 2023 may surpass the previous record.\nSmall amounts of rain not enough: BCWS\nMatt MacDonald, the BCWS's lead forecaster, says there's no relief in sight from persistent drought conditions, and small amounts of rain won't be enough to reduce the stress in B.C.'s forests.\nMacDonald told the briefing that the role of climate change cannot be ignored in assessing heat waves, drought and wildfire conditions in the province.\n\"We're seeing exactly what climate change experts have been alerting us to, which is a higher frequency of extreme weather events,\" he said, noting seven of the province's 10 busiest wildfire seasons on record have occurred in the last decade.\nB.C. is burning through its wildfire budget well before the season even peaks\nBoth officials emphasized the importance of detecting fires quickly after they start. Chapman thanked members of the public for making reports that helped crews douse or hold three dozen out of more than 40 new blazes sparked over the Canada Day long weekend, the majority of which were caused by lightning, he said.\u00a0\nCampfire bans across southern Interior, southwest\nAdditional campfire bans are on the way in response to the increasing risk.\nThe BCWS says as of noon on Friday, campfires will no longer be permitted in the Kamloops Fire Centre, an area that covers a large part of the southern Interior.\nThe expanded restrictions also include all areas of the Coastal Fire Centre, except Haida Gwaii.\nWhat happens after the Donnie Creek wildfire, now larger than P.E.I., stops burning?\nCampfires have been banned since last month across the Prince George Fire Centre in the province's northeast, and in the driest sections of the Northwest and Coastal fire centres, including Vancouver Island.\nEffective at 12pm, Friday, July 7 Category 1 campfires will be prohibited throughout the Kamloops Fire Centre to help prevent human-caused wildfires and protect public safety. <a href=\"https://t.co/7ABU8XU7Rw\">https://t.co/7ABU8XU7Rw</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iDAhqIpzPU\">pic.twitter.com/iDAhqIpzPU</a>\n&mdash;\n@BCGovFireInfo\n\u00a0\nThe wildfire service says campfires no larger than half-a-metre by half-a-metre in size will still be allowed in the Cariboo\u00a0Fire Centre in B.C.'s Interior, and the Southeast Fire Centre, where wildfire danger is primarily ranked as moderate.\nMore than 100 active blazes are burning across B.C., most of them in the northeast corner, including \nthe 5,715-square-kilometre Donnie Creek wildfire\n south of Fort Nelson, the largest ever recorded in the province.",

Children's Hospital Foundation.\nThe tickets were\u00a0$1 each, with all proceeds going to\u00a0the B.C. Children's Hospital Foundation. LooPS' hope is that their record attempt will \ngenerate far more for the charity\n than just ticket revenues.\n\"It's been an absolutely\u00a0amazing response we've had from everybody in the community helping us out,\"\u00a0Fennell told CBC News from the Blarney Stone stage.\n102-year-old Vancouver woman sets Guinness World Record for oldest curler\nThe world's fastest motorized log is for sale\nAccording to the British private records-keeper, the \nprevious record\n for most live music concerts in 12\u00a0hours in separate cities was U.K.-based indie-pop singer\u00a0\nMinhee\u00a0Jones\n, who played eight shows on Dec. 7,\u00a02019.\u00a0\nTo break that\u00a0record, Guinness World Records stipulates the cities must have populations more than 15,000, be at least 50 km apart,\u00a0concerts must sell at least 10 tickets and sets need to be 15 minutes long without any breaks longer than 30 seconds.\nFor smaller towns, the record for most concerts\u00a0was also set in England by pop singer Tom Grennan, who played 10 shows over 12 hours in 2018, but\u00a0in\u00a0communities that\u00a0had populations under 15,000.\n'Laser focused' on record attempt\nOn Saturday, LooPS began their whirlwind tour at 10 a.m. in Squamish, B.C., then drove to Vancouver, followed by\u00a0Abbotsford, Burnaby, Chilliwack, Richmond,\u00a0Mission,\u00a0Delta, before finally closing-out the night at\u00a0Langley's\u00a0Poseidon Restaurant and Bar. They finished the set with 20 minutes to spare.\nIn total, the band's micro-tour crisscrossed more than 550 km of\u00a0the Lower Mainland's\u00a0roads.\n\"It is a big stress-relief now,\" Roy\u00a0said on Sunday. \"It was a huge adrenaline dump at the end, but it was pretty fun the whole day.\n\"We were pretty dialled in, we were laser-focused on what we had to do,\" he\u00a0said.\u00a0\nRocker duo LooPS played nine 15-minute concerts spanning 550 km across the Lower Mainland to benefit the B.C. Children's Hospital Foundation on Saturday, opening in Squamish, B.C., and ending in Langley.\n \n(Google Maps)\nRoy said the band's next step is to submit their filmed and time-recorded evidence they played nine shows within the strict guidelines, but said without paying a rush premium, they likely won't hear confirmation from Guinness World Records for a while.\nIn the meantime, the band's next show is in Prince George, B.C., where door ticket proceeds will also go to B.C. Children's. Roy said they will continue collecting donations for the rest of the month through their website.\n82-year-old B.C. resident sets Guinness World Record as oldest man to perform a headstand\nAs Roy and Fennell belted out the harmonies of the final chorus of the duo's new single, \"Last Goodbye,\" in Vancouver, he ended the set in a way one could only expect\u00a0from a band on a whirlwind, one-day, nine-stop tour spanning an entire region.\n\"We're done, that's 15 minutes,\" Roy told the audience as Fennell swiftly wrapped up audio cables and began packing up their gear. \"Thank you so much, we've got to\u00a0get to the next stop.\"",

        "content": "Like many pickleball players, Lawrence Lukow is an avid devotee of the sport.\u00a0\n\"They call me the Cheetah because of my speed,\" Lukow recently told CBC associate producer Shelley Joyce after a game at the municipal court in Kamloops, B.C.\nLukow has been a member of the Kamloops Pickleball Club for seven years. A self-described \"middle of the road\" player, he enjoys the sport because it's enjoyable and affordable.\n\"It's fun,\" he said. \"It gets you off the couch instead of napping and watching TV.\"\nAlso like many pickleball players, Lukow wears a knee brace.\u00a0\nIn his case, playing didn't cause an injury, but he's on the cusp of needing a knee replacement and he doesn't want to make things worse.\u00a0\nEase into it\nInjuries are common among pickleball players, according to physiotherapists who treat them.\u00a0\nThe sport has become wildly popular in the past few years.\nMany people are drawn to pickleball because it is social, easy to learn and played on a smaller court than tennis, thus requiring less running around. These factors, some say, make it attractive for players who are older or out of shape.\u00a0\nJen Larsen, a physiotherapist at Kamloops Physiotherapy, says in her practice she sees a lot of repetitive strain injuries \u2014 especially from new players at the beginning of the season.\n\"They start the sport, they pick it up, they play it, they're then at the pickleball court five to six days a week, and they're playing for multiple hours, like two, three\u00a0and four hours a day,\" Larsen said.\nPhysiotherapists say short bursts and quick lunges while playing pickleball can cause injuries. \n \n(bhpix/Shutterstock)\nLarsen recommends slowly easing into the sport. She says to start with about 30 minutes a day and gradually increasing time played from there.\u00a0\n\"Learn the game, learn the strategies so that you can play well and your body can tolerate it,\" she said.\nFocus on knees and hips\nPart of the appeal of pickleball is that it's a smaller court that doesn't require as much athleticism as a sport like tennis, says Brent Stevenson, co-owner of Envision Physiotherapy.\u00a0\n\"It's a sport you can pick up very easily and be reasonably competent at it,\" he said. \"It's kind of like giant ping pong.\"\u00a0\nBut, he adds, the game relies on quick, sharp movement and lunging for the ball \u2014 which Stevenson says can be a recipe for a strained knee or lower back if a player doesn't have the right footwork.\nAudio\nKamloops entrepreneur creates Ping-Pong/pickleball mashup\nLori Goss\u00a0is another Kamloops pickleball player who, like Lukow, says she was quickly drawn to the sport.\u00a0\n\"It's very social and it's so much fun,\" she said.\u00a0\nShe wears braces on both of her knees as \"preventative medicine,\" she says.\u00a0\nSuch braces can make the sport more comfortable,\u00a0especially for older players with arthritis, Stevenson says.\nBut he says knee braces don't solve the underlying issues at the root of the pain or potential injury.\u00a0\nKnee and hip issues are often related, he says, so exercises for strength and flexibility in both those areas are key.\u00a0\nMetro Matters\nWhy pickleball explains a lot about the workings of local government\nPickleball's popularity is increasing \u2014 and so are game-related injuries\nStevenson stresses the importance of an active, dynamic warmup before playing, with a focus on lateral movement and footwork.\u00a0\nOne positive of pickleball, Stevenson says, is that there are fewer upper body injuries than might occur in tennis because the balls are much lighter.\u00a0",

Wildfire Service (BCWS) says some rain is expected to help firefighters in northern B.C., where most of B.C.'s fires of note \u2014 those that pose a threat to public safety or are publicly visible \u2014 are burning.\nHowever, two fires of note are burning close to communities in the Interior. One of them, the \nRoss Moore Lake fire\n\u00a0south of Kamloops, B.C., more than doubled in size overnight \u2014 going from seven\u00a0square kilometres to 18 square kilometres.\nOn Sunday evening, \nan evacuation order\n\u00a0issued by the Thompson-Nicola Regional District (TNRD)\u00a0Saturday was expanded from 49 properties to 344. Another 157 properties are on \nan evacuation alert\n\u00a0due to the fire.\n\"We've had pretty hot and dry conditions for weeks now, so in some ways it was inevitable that we'd get here but obviously this activity is far too close for comfort,\" said Kevin Skrepnek, a former wildfire fighter, and now an emergency official with the TNRD.\nMelanie Bibeau, a fire information officer with the BCWS, says the Ross Moore Lake fire is highly visible from Highway 5 and Highway 5A.\nThe Ross Moore Lake wildfire south of Kamloops was suspected to have been caused by lightning.\n \n(Submitted by Katie Corneille)\n\"Currently, our crews are working today in the southeast corner, putting a lot of focus in that area,\" she told CBC News on Sunday morning. \"We are expecting to have aerial resources overhead today as well. People within the Kamloops area might see some helicopters or potentially air tankers going over that fire today.\"\nKamloops is a city of around 90,000 people located in the central Interior, around 350 km northeast of Vancouver.\u00a0The properties on evacuation order or alert due to the Ross Moore Lake fire are in a rural area south of Kamloops.\nMike McCulley, another fire information officer, said that dry lightning and thunderstorm conditions are expected to move toward\u00a0the Okanagan and other portions of southern B.C., some of which are under a heat warning \u2014 including the North Thompson, Boundary and Kootenay Lake areas.\n\"In the last week, we've had over 61,000 [lightning] strikes across the entire province,\" he said. \"Not only is it hot and difficult conditions, but these windy conditions increase fire behaviour.\"\u00a0\nHow to find wildfire news and evacuation information in B.C.\nHow to get ready for a wildfire evacuation on short notice\nMcCulley said that most of the fires now burning in the province have been caused by lightning, compared to earlier in the season where human activity\u00a0caused most of the blazes.\n\"We do need the public to remain extremely diligent. We need them to pay very close attention,\" he said. \"Any fire that's human caused takes away resources ... that we could use to help fight lightning-caused fires.\"\nAs of Saturday afternoon,\u00a0\n250 people\n\u00a0had\u00a0been ordered to leave their homes across B.C. due to fires, and 3,347 people were told to get ready to leave at a moment's notice.\nAlmost 600 international firefighters helping\nMcCulley said there are just under 600 international firefighters helping with operations in the province, many of which are in the province's north.

        "content": "This week, British Columbians heard some troubling news about drought conditions affecting large parts of the province, bringing concerns about water scarcity and possible restrictions.\nOfficials have warned of a \"\nvery serious drought season\n that will require action for everyone\" and asked residents to take shorter showers, limit lawn watering and only do laundry when they have a full load.\nWater-intensive oil and gas operations have already had restrictions imposed on them by the B.C. Energy Regulator and more limits on residential water use may be in the future.\nBut sorting out how the drought is affecting different parts of the province and what that means for residents of those regions isn't particularly straightforward.\nDrought conditions at highest level in parts of B.C. as province warns of tightening water restrictions\nTo shed some light on the situation, CBC News spoke with Jonathan Boyd, a hydrologist with the River Forecast Centre.\n\"I can understand the confusion,\" he said. \"Of course,\u00a0the recommendation of conservation should be applied every summer in British Columbia, no matter what the situation is.\"\nHere, he answers some common questions about understanding B.C.'s latest drought.\nI've heard that drought conditions are especially bad in certain 'water basins.' What does that mean?\nWhen Minister of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness Bowinn Ma said that \"\nover two-thirds of our water basins\n are in Level 4 or 5\" drought, she was referring to the 34 regional divisions the province has made for drought management purposes.\nBoyd said that, in most cases, it means the same thing as a watershed or a catchment area.\n\"Essentially,\" Boyd explained, \"all of the water that would drop on the land that then might end up in the same river constitutes what would be a water basin.\"\nBut that's not true in all cases, he added. Some of the province's so-called water basins are actually geographical regions, like Haida Gwaii or east and west Vancouver Island, which aren't connected to specific rivers.\nA person walks along the shore of Alouette Lake in Maple Ridge, B.C., during drought-like conditions in October 2022.\n \n(Ben Nelms/CBC)\nHow do I figure out what water basin I live in and what the drought level is?\nThe \nB.C. Drought Information Portal\n is probably the best place to start. It includes a map showing the outlines of the water basins, with their current drought levels, ranging from \"adverse impacts rare\" at Level 1 to \"adverse impacts almost certain\" at Level 5.\nMost major cities, including those in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island, sit entirely within a single water basin. On the other hand, places like Prince George and Kamloops are divided \u2014 a reminder that cities are often settled at the confluence of two or more river systems.\nDrought conditions force B.C. cattle ranchers to consider selling their herds\nHow are drought levels decided?\nThere's a provincial drought technical working group that meets every two weeks beginning in the late spring or early summer to work this out, Boyd explained.\n\"That's under normal conditions. But when conditions become a bit more challenging, that switches to a weekly meeting\" where drought levels are decided, he said.\nThe River Forecast Centre will bring its recommendations for drought levels, and regional representatives will come with their own assessment based on discussions with people like hydrologists, meteorologists, fisheries biologists and agricultural representatives.\nBoyd said the weekly determination of the drought level isn't just about hitting a certain threshold for low streamflow for the rivers in a particular region. The time of year might also come into play \u2014 usually, lower water levels are expected beginning in late August, but this year they've come alarmingly early.\nFarmers in Sunshine Coast say they want to be exempt from water restrictions during drought\nWhat about residential lawn watering restrictions? How are those connected to drought levels?\nIt's not a direct connection, exactly. The drought levels decided by the province are determined by factors like precipitation, snowmelt and water levels \u2014 things over which we have little immediate control.\nIn B.C.'s larger cities, the drinking water that's used to sprinkle lawns comes from protected storage systems, such as dammed reservoirs or underground aquifers, which are less prone to be affected by the weather.\nFor example, where Boyd lives in Victoria, the drought has hit the highest end of the scale at Level 5, but the Capital Regional District's reservoirs were still 86 per cent full as of July 9. That helps to explain why watering restrictions \nhaven't progressed beyond Stage 1\n, which is automatically in effect every summer.\nWater rushes from the Cleveland Dam, which holds back Capilano Lake, one of the major sources of Metro Vancouver's drinking water.\n \n(Jonathan Hayward/Canadian Press)\nHow do I find out about my local watering restrictions?\nWe wish we had a simple answer for you.\nYou can learn about your residential watering restrictions from whatever body supplies your drinking water, but there's a huge range of different systems across the province. In some cases, it might be the city you live in. In others, the regional district or First Nation, but there could also be small waterworks or irrigation districts serving individual neighbourhoods within a city.\nFor example, in the Victoria and Vancouver areas, the Capital Regional District and Metro Vancouver supply water across several municipalities, while cities like Prince George and Kamloops have their own local water utilities.\nThen there's Kelowna. The city is home to \nfour separate utilities\n supplying water to residents, depending on where they live. Each one of those utilities can issue its own watering restrictions.\nTurning your yard into a meadow can save water and time. Here's how to do it\nHow long is this drought going to last?\nThis is the question Boyd says he gets asked more often than any other, and he says it's tricky to answer because weather is difficult to predict beyond 10 days into the future.\nStill, the prognosis isn't great.\n\"For Vancouver Island and the South Coast, typically July and August are the driest months of the year, so the expectation is that unless we get really wet, cold conditions \u2026 the drought conditions are going to worsen,\" Boyd said.\nQ&A\nTake shorter showers, run only full washing loads ahead of water restrictions, B.C. minister advises\nSummer weather in the Interior can be a bit more erratic, so it's possible there could be some significant rainstorms bringing a bit of local relief, he added.\n\"What I haven't seen before is just how widespread and severe it is across the province, especially this early in the season,\" Boyd said.\n\"I just don't see a way that all of B.C. would end up out of this drought situation unless we had, unfortunately, such heavy rain that it might actually cause flooding.\"",

        "content": "Sophia Smith scored twice for the United States in the opening half and the two-time defending champions kicked off the Women's World Cup with a 3-0 victory over tournament first-timers Vietnam on Saturday.\nLindsey Horan added a goal for the favoured Americans, who have won four World Cups overall and are vying for an unprecedented three-peat in this year's tournament.\nVietnam drew comparisons to Thailand, the team the Americans routed 13-0 in in their 2019 World Cup opening game. But Vietnam was surprisingly resilient, kept the game closer than expected, and goalkeeper Tran Thi Kim Thanh stopped Alex Morgan's first-half penalty attempt.\nMorgan was knocked to the field clutching her calf after trying for the rebound off her missed penalty, but she quickly returned. It was just her second penalty miss for the United States.\nSmith, one of 14 Americans playing in their first World Cup, showed why she was named both U.S. Soccer's Player of the Year and the National Women's Soccer League MVP last year with her two first-half goals.\nWATCH |\u00a0Detailing Canada's journey at the Women's World Cup:\nVideo Essay: Canada's women's soccer team ready for the World Cup\n9 days ago\nDuration \n2:54\nCBC's Shireen Ahmed takes us through the journey Canada's women's national soccer team has been through, from winning Olympic gold, to the challenge facing them at the World Cup.\nSmith scored off a pass from captain Lindsey Horan in the 14th minute. Smith and Horan celebrated with a choreographed handshake after the goal. She scored again in first-half stoppage time to make it 2-0 going into the break. The United States was at first flagged as offside before a video review confirmed the goal.\nThe U.S. team was infused with young talent including Smith and Trinity Rodman after settling for a disappointing bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Among the veterans, 38-year-old Megan Rapinoe made her 200th international appearance against Vietnam.\nRapinoe, who scored in the World Cup final in France and was named that tournament's best player, did not start. She announced before the team left for New Zealand that this would be her last World Cup and she would retire from her professional team at the end of the season.\nRapinoe and midfielder Rose Lavelle, who were both limited by injuries in the run-up to the tournament, both came in as substitutes in the 63rd minute. Rapinoe sported bright blue hair.\nThe youngest player on the team, 18-year-old Alyssa Thompson, was also a second-half sub.\nHoran scored into a wide-open net off a pass from Smith, who was rushed by the goalkeeper and deftly sent the ball back to her. Horan, who was recently engaged, kissed her ring in celebration.\nThere was early drama when Rodman, the daughter of former NBA great Dennis Rodman and one of the young newcomers on the team, appeared injured after falling hard on her back when she was tackled by defender Tran Thi Thu. Rapinoe warmed up on the sidelines and a stretcher was brought out on the filed, but Rodman stood and returned to the match a few moments later.\nSinclair misses penalty kick as Canada ties Nigeria in Women's World Cup opener\nPreview\nWomen's World Cup: What to know about all 32 teams\nSaturday's game was the first meeting between the United States and Vietnam.

Portugal is also making its first World Cup appearance.\nThe group plays all of their matches in New Zealand, which is co-hosting the tournament with Australia. The United States plays the Netherlands in a 2019 final rematch on Thursday in Wellington.\nShould the United States top the group, the team will head to Sydney for the round of 16.\nBack home in the United States, a sign was erected on the North Lawn of the White House that said \"Go Team USA!

She was awarded a second shot on a VAR review after her first attempt was well saved by Kerly Theus diving full stretch to her right.\n\ud83c\udfaf <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StanwayGeorgia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@StanwayGeorgia</a> from the spot! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Lionesses?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Lionesses</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFAWWC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FIFAWWC</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wDbr0E5CVe\">pic.twitter.com/wDbr0E5CVe</a>\n&mdash;\n@FIFAWWC\nThe Group D game between the No. 4 and the 53rd-ranked teams was tense from start to finish with Haiti forward Melchie Dumornay regularly troubling the England defence.\nTheus made a succession of saves to thwart England's chances of increasing its margin and then Haiti went within inches of a stunning late equalizer.\nEngland goalkeeper Mary Earps made a crucial reflex save in the 81st in a close-range, one-on-one with substitute forward Roseline Eloissaint.\nIt was a second key moment from the keeper. Just after halftime Dumornay lashed a powerful right-foot shot that forced Earps into a save.\nIt was an impressive debut in front of a 44,369 crowd from Haiti, one of the last three teams to qualify for the biggest Women's World Cup ever staged.\nDespite being in control in the first half, England was far from convincing against a Haiti lineup that got numbers back in defence.\nDumornay was threatening on the counter and made inroads after having some early medical treatment. After a long upfield pass in the 35th, she didn't quite connect with a cross from the right as she attempted a bicycle kick from inside the area.\nEngland was missing some key performers from its title triumph at Euro 2022 but would have been expecting a more polished display.\nAnalysis\nA look at the 23 players seeking Canada's 1st Women's World Cup championship\nOpinion\nCanada faces tough competition in Women's World Cup's Group B\nAlessia Russo started up front and created opportunities but wasn't able to convert them. Approaching the hour, she forced two saves from Theus within a minute, while Haiti was down to 10 players with inspirational skipper Nerilia Mondesir getting treatment on a left ankle injury.\nRusso's header in the 64th was tipped over the crossbar by Theus, the seventh save from the Haiti goalkeeper. Millie Bright also fired over the crossbar minutes later.\nBoth teams are back in action Friday, with England moving to Sydney and likely to make lineup changes to face Denmark, and Haiti meeting China in Adelaide.\nThe Haiti team, drawing on players based mainly in France and the U.S., aims to bring some positive news to a country in turmoil.\nThe team has l imited sponsors, its training center is closed because of gang violence and some of its biggest fans can't afford a TV to watch the World Cup.\nJapan cruises to 5-0 opening win over Zambia\nHinata Miyazawa scored a pair of goals, while Mina Tanaka and Jun Endo each added a goal and an assist, as Japan shut out Zambia 5-0 to open Women's World Cup play\u00a0for both sides.\nMiyazawa found the back of the net with one-time finishes on either side of halftime to secure an easy win over the Copper Queens in what was their World Cup debut.\nTanaka, denied goals twice on offside calls, scored in similar fashion in the 55th minute, assisted by Endo.\nEndo then scored in the 71st minute, finding herself alone on the left side of goalkeeper Catherine Musonda's goal and slotting home a left-footed strike.\nVictory for Japan. \ud83d\ude4c<br><br>An injury-time penalty sees the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFAWWC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FIFAWWC</a> 2011 Champions claim a convincing win over Zambia!\n&mdash;\n@FIFAWWC\nNot only did Tanaka see two goals called back by VAR for offside, the Nakeshido were awarded an early second-half penalty only to see it rescinded for yet another offside call.\nThe Group C clash was the first time a senior World Cup match was hosted at Hamilton's Waikato Stadium. Saturday's attendance of 16,111 nearly filled the stadium that holds just over 18,000.\nZambia struggled to find its footing in its World Cup debut. Star striker Barbra Banda found herself isolated at the top of the pitch and marked by three Japanese defenders for much of the night.\nDeep into second-half injury time, the Copper Queens' fortunes went from bad to worse as goalkeeper Catherine Musonda, who started the match in place of an injured Hazel Nali, was sent off with a second yellow card for a foul in the box.\nInitially, Riko Ueki's penalty hit the underside of the crossbar, but VAR ruled the penalty be retaken for goalkeeper encroachment. Ueki sent her second chance into the lower right corner of the net.\nVangsgaard lifts Denmark over China in 90th minute\nSubstitute Amalie Vangsgaard scored in the 90th minute as Denmark beat China 1-0\u00a0on Saturday.\nWith time running out in a game of few chances, she rose to head home Pernille Harder's late corner.\nVangsgaard had only come on in the 85th and made a quick impact with her first goal for the country. It was also the first headed goal of the tournament and sparked joyous celebrations from Denmark's players.\nThe win saw the Danes go level with European champions England at the top of Group D after its 1-0 win against Haiti earlier in the day.\nLate, but worth the wait for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dbulandshold?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dbulandshold</a>. \ud83d\ude4c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeyondGreatness?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#BeyondGreatness</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FIFAWWC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FIFAWWC</a>\n&mdash;\n@FIFAWWC\nJosefine Hasbo had looked like blowing Denmark's chance of victory after missing a golden opportunity to score early in the second half. With an open goal to aim at, she headed over the bar from inside the area.\nVangsgaard was more clinical when her chance came, with a looping effort from deep in the box that bounced before crossing the line.\nIt was a cruel way for China to lose after stifling the Danes with its disciplined defence. Denmark failed to register a single shot on target in the first half, while China managed just one when Zhang Linyan forced a save from the edge of the box.\nChina substitute Wang Shuang was denied by Lene Christensen at the start of the second half.\nDenmark plays England in Sydney on Friday and China travels to Adelaide to face Haiti on the same day.",

Waved at them while he was actually in the game.\nAnd if that wasn't enough, he saved his best moment for the end. He watched the ball sail into the net, something he's done about 800 times before for club and country, then sprinted to the right corner of the field and leaped into the arms of teammates.\nMessi celebrates with his family after scoring the winner on Friday night.\n \n(Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)\nThe team's owners \u2014 David Beckham, Jorge Mas and Jose Mas \u2014 were waiting as he left the pitch; Jorge Mas planted a kiss onto the superstar's sweat-coated cheek. Some Cruz Azul players stood in silence and just watched; they'll have a story to tell, too, about how it took an incredible Messi moment to defeat them.\nIt took Inter Miami four years of planning and two years of actual pursuing to bring Messi to the club.\n\"Worth it,\" Beckham said earlier in the week.\nHow right he was.\n\"It's such a moment for this country,\" Beckham said. \"It's such a moment for the league. And it's a very proud moment for us.\"\nGRIT\u00c1LO LEO \ud83d\udde3\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/IshpSiUstf\">pic.twitter.com/IshpSiUstf</a>\n&mdash;\n@InterMiamiCF\nNobody even left their seats when the halftime whistle blew. The reason: Messi was on the field. He warmed up for about five\u00a0minutes during intermission with the other reserves before they all left for the locker room.\nThat's when the fans, finally, could put their phones down and take a breath. Temporarily, anyway. The wait was officially on: When was Messi coming in? He resumed warmups while the second half was getting under way, jogging around behind the end line near Miami's supporter section, and fans roared in delight when he gave them a wave.\nMessi checks in\nAnd about eight minutes into the second half, the answer: It was Messi time.\nMessi checked in early in the second half with Inter Miami leading 1-0. He hugged the player he was replacing, midfielder Benjamin Cremaschi, then trotted onto the field as the estimated crowd of 21,000 all seemed to be standing, almost all of them with phones out to chronicle the moment.\nThe moment we\u2019ve been waiting for.<br><br>Welcome to the show, Lionel Messi. <a href=\"https://t.co/3NYCnVOpx9\">pic.twitter.com/3NYCnVOpx9</a>\n&mdash;\n@MLS\nHad he missed the free kick, the game would have gone to a penalty shootout. Instead, Messi ended it on his terms.\n\"It was the last play of the game and I wanted to score so I didn't go to penalties,\" Messi said.\nThe first Inter Miami goal of the Messi era was scored by Robert Taylor, who took a long cross from Robbie Robinson, moved into the box and sent a low drive off the inside of the far post and into the back of the net for a 1-0 lead late in the first half.\nMessi leaped from his seat, threw his hands in the air, applauded several times and broke into a wide smile.\nCruz Azul tied the game shortly after Messi checked in and had plenty of chances to take a late lead. But the final act belonged to Messi, a storybook ending if there ever was one.\n\"It's common for him, you know,\" Martino said. \"It looks absolutely normal, but it's not ... we're speaking about the GOAT.\"\nStars in attendance\nIt was a gathering of GOATs at Messi's debut match: LeBron James and Serena Williams were there \u2014 like Messi in soccer, they're in the conversation of \"greatest of all time\" when it comes to the NBA and tennis. Music legends Gloria and Emilio Estefan showed up, as did Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, and Kim Kardashian arrived saying one of her sons had a particular reason why he had to attend.\n\"He's so excited to see Messi,\" Kardashian said.\nEveryone was. James \u2014 who knows a thing or two about making a highly celebrated move to Miami, after he joined the Heat in 2010 and won his first two NBA titles in a four-year stay \u2014 greeted Messi with a long embrace as the teams took the field. And after the goal, James acknowledged the greatness.\n\"INCREDIBLE,\" James tweeted, with a goat emoji for emphasis.\nGOAT things. \ud83d\ude0f<br><br>Messi x <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@KingJames</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/HBtkucee4w\">pic.twitter.com/HBtkucee4w</a>\n&mdash;\n@MLS\nNo matter what, it was a massive night for soccer in the U.S. \u2014 Messi making his first Miami appearance while, on the other side of the globe, the U.S. women's team opened its World Cup title defence in New Zealand by beating Vietnam 3-0.\nMessi signed\n\u00a0\na two-and-a-half-year contract that will pay him between $50 million and $60 million annually \u2014 and almost certainly more than $1 million per match.\n'This is a fantastic opportunity': Global icon Messi officially joins MLS' Inter Miami\nWith Miami move, Messi joins elite list of soccer greats who went west\nMessi arrived with the team about two hours before game time, dressed in the team colours \u2014 pink T-shirt, black shorts. He stopped for a few photos and handshakes as he entered the tunnel leading to the locker room.\nAs the match started, Messi took his seat and watched his new team, in the all-pink jersey, shorts and socks, start his new era. Almost every seat was filled, many by people wearing newly acquired Miami jerseys with Messi's name on the back. They chanted his name a few times, waved flags bearing his name and number.\nThe excitement kept building, all the way to the end. And Messi made sure his new fans went home happy.\n\"It was very important,\" Messi said, \"for us to get this win.\"",

New Zealand had never won a game at the World Cup.\nBut the New Zealanders produced a 1-0 upset win over 1995 champion Norway in the tournament's first match, hours after a fatal shooting in downtown Auckland shocked their nation. A minute's silence was held before that match at Eden Park. A few hours later at Stadium Australia, a 75,784-strong crowd \u2014 a record for women's soccer match in Australia \u2014 also observed a minute of silence as a mark of respect before kick off.\nA hush had gone over the crowd earlier than that when it was announced that Kerr, the highest-profile player in this part of the world, wouldn't be starting against Ireland.\nNew Zealand players celebrate the team's 1-0 victory in the FIFA Women's World Cup Group A match against Norway at Eden Park on Thursday in Auckland, New Zealand.\n \n(Buda Mendes/Getty Images)\nKerr questionable for Canada match\nShe's also set to miss Australia's second Group B game against Nigeria next week and there are no guarantees she'll be back to take on Olympic champion Canada on July 31.\n\"She's so, so important, she's our spiritual leader and whatever role she plays in the next however long will be massive,\" Catley said. \"Sam was involved non-stop from the first chat in the changing rooms to the last chat.

Without her leading the attack against Ireland, her teammates appeared short of ideas or cutting edge.\nThen there was the psychological boost her absence provided Ireland, which was out to cause an upset in its first appearance at the World Cup.\nLittle wonder Australia coach Tony Gustavsson had tried to keep Kerr's injury a secret for as long as he could.\n\"I hope you respect and understand the reason that when I sat here yesterday I couldn't talk about it,\" he said in a post-match interview. \"But once we came to the stadium we didn't play any type of mind games.\n\"We were honest.

Anyone can make that mistake. Nobody blames her.\"\nIreland had beaten Australia in the teams' last meeting, winning 3-2 in a friendly in Dublin in 2021.\nAnd by the end Australia needed keeper Mackenzie Arnold to help hold off a series of late attacks in search of an equalizer.\nPauw said she was proud Ireland had \"showed that we can play against the very best teams in the world.\"\n\"We've now showed that against Sweden, against USA, now against Australia,\" she said. \"The next one is against Canada the Olympic champion. We do not fear anyone and these players adapt so quickly.\"",

        "content": "After missing out on Lionel Messi, Saudi Arabian soccer team Al-Hilal made a record 300 million euro ($332 million US) bid for Kylian Mbappe on Monday, an offer which could see the France striker join Cristiano Ronaldo in the oil-rich kingdom.\nParis Saint-Germain confirmed the offer for its player and has given Al-Hilal permission to open negotiations directly with Mbappe.\nThe 2018 World Cup winner is in a contract standoff with PSG after his decision not to take up the option of a 12-month extension on his deal. Instead, he plans to walk away as a free agent at the end of the upcoming season when he is widely expected to join Real Madrid.\nPSG cut Mbappe from its preseason tour of Japan on Saturday, with the French club determined to sell him unless he can be convinced to sign a new contract.\nA new deal now looks highly unlikely with relations between the 24-year-old Mbappe and PSG becoming increasingly tense.\nSaudi Arabia has sought in recent years to buy its way into international sports. Besides Ronaldo, whose contract reportedly earns him up to $200 million a year, Saudi-funded LIV Golf has shaken up professional golf.\nThe moves are part of efforts by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to leverage the kingdom's oil wealth to provide new jobs and opportunities for Saudi Arabia's youth. However, critics have dismissed the efforts as \"sportswashing,\" attempting to leverage professional sports to clean up the kingdom's image as it remains one of the world's top executioners and waging a years-long war in Yemen.\nFrench superstar Mbappe informs PSG he will not trigger contract extension: report\nU.S. intelligence agencies also believe Prince Mohammed ordered the killing and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\nEarlier this year, Al-Hilal failed to sign Messi, with the Argentina great choosing to join Inter Miami instead.\nThe bid for Mbappe would make him the most expensive soccer player in history, overtaking the $262 million PSG paid for Neymar, who joined from Barcelona in 2017.\nSaudis targeting top players\nThe offer represents Saudi Arabia's most ambitious move yet as part of a determined recruitment drive to lure the game's biggest players to the country.\nAfter Ronaldo agreed to join Al-Nassr in December, Saudi teams have gone into overdrive by targeting leading names from Europe's top leagues. Real Madrid great and current Ballon d'Or holder Karim Benzema signed for Saudi champion Al-Ittihad last month and has been joined by 2018 World Cup winner N'Golo Kante.\nRoberto Firmino, Kalidou Koulibaly and Marcelo Brozovic are among other big names to head to the lucrative Saudi league, which is making mega-money offers to players in a bid to raise the profile and quality of soccer in the country.\nWhile that was not enough to convince Messi to join Al-Hilal after leaving PSG, more stars are expected to follow in the footsteps of Ronaldo and Co.\nPremier League players like Riyad Mahrez and Jordan Henderson have recently been linked with moves from Manchester City and Liverpool, respectively.\nThe reported salaries and commercial deals for Ronaldo, Benzema and Kante could earn them a combined figure of nearly $1 billion.\nMbappe has said he plans to see out the final year of his contract, which would leave PSG powerless to prevent him from leaving for nothing next year.\n'This is a fantastic opportunity': Global icon Messi officially joins MLS' Inter Miami\nSoccer great Ronaldo embraces 'new challenge' with Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr\nThe French champions, who are owned by Qatar Sports Investments, have already seen Messi leave for nothing in return and are determined to earn a fee for a player who is widely considered one of the few capable of taking over from Messi and Ronaldo as soccer's biggest star.\nHis omission from PSG's touring squad in Japan raises the possibility that he could be benched next season if he refuses to sign a contract or agree to leave during this transfer window.\nAl-Hilal are said to be among a host of clubs that have been alerted to his potential availability, but it is unlikely any could match the bid that has been put forward.\nThere has been an expectation that he would join Madrid, which had a bid of $190 million rejected by PSG in 2021. Madrid needs a top class forward after losing Benzema at the end of the season.\nMbappe had until July 31 to trigger a one-year extension on his contract. He has been at the club since 2017 after signing from Monaco in a transfer worth a reported $190 million.",

Manuela Giuliano's free kick drifted over the crossbar before Giadda Greggi drew a smart stop from Correa in the 82nd minute.\nGoalkeeper Francesca Durante pushed away Argentine midfielder Florencia Bonsegundo's attempt from a free kick in stoppage time, ensuring a winning start in the tournament for the 2019 quarter-finalists.\nItaly coach Milena Bertolini was vindicated after putting her faith in Dragoni as the teenager impressed on her debut before making way for Girelli, the oldest member of Italy's squad, who scored her 54th international goal on her 104th appearance.\nArgentina caused plenty of problems for Durante but could not manage a shot on target until Bonsegundo's free kick in the 94th minute.\nItaly play Sweden in Wellington on Saturday.

And Tom Sermanni has coached in most of it.\nThe Scottish-born, Australian-based coach is working his sixth FIFA Women's World Cup, and his second as a member of the Canadian coaching staff. Sermanni, who also had a 16-month stint in charge of the U.S. women in 2013-14, served as Australia's head coach at the soccer showcase in 1995, 2007 and 2011 and led New Zealand at the 2019 tournament.\nWith Canada, he served as an assistant to John Herdman at the 2015 World Cup and is a member of Bev Priestman's staff at the current competition in Australia and New Zealand.\nBut labelling Sermanni an assistant coach really doesn't do him justice.

Sermanni.\nOther mentors in the FIFA program include Priestman, former Canada and Norway coach Even Pellerud, Brazil and former U.S. coach Pia Sundhage and current U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski.\nSermanni says the learning goes both ways.\n\"Very much so. And they keep you on their toes with that. And they also keep you thinking about how you might do things or how you might deal with a problem. The other great thing is there's no solution in coaching, there's no one way to do it.\"\nBorn in Glasgow, Sermanni played in England and Scotland for Albion Rovers, Blackpool, Torquay United and Dunfermline Athletic. In his early days as a semi-pro player, he doubled as a primary school teacher with a specialization in physical education.\nHe was brought to Australia in 1983 by Marconi, the football arm of a sporting club founded by Italian immigrants.\n\"I only intended to come for a year and here I am 40 years on, still here,\" said Sermanni, who lives with Alison, his wife of 36 years, in the Sydney suburb of Brighton-le-Sands.\nTHE BUZZER\nWhat to know for the Women's World Cup\nPreview\nWomen's World Cup: What to know about all 32 teams\nThe coach who brought him to Marconi joined Canberra City the following year and Sermanni followed him there. He taught high school in Canberra and eventually became a player-manager with Canberra Croatia.\nHe eventually spent 16 years in Canberra where he worked at the Australian Institute of Sport. It was there that a friend approached him in 1994 to see if he had any interest in taking on the Australian women's head coaching job.\n2 stints as Australia coach\nAfter his coaching role with the Matildas ended in 1997, he spent time in Japan as an assistant coach at Sanfrecce Hiroshima FC before moving to the U.S. in 2001 for an assistant coaching role with the San Jose CyberRays and then the top job with the New York Power, another team in the now-defunct Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA).\nWATCH\u00a0| Was letting Christine Sinclair take the penalty vs Nigeria a mistake?\nCanada vs. Nigeria FIFA Women's World Cup reaction show\n5 days ago\nDuration \n25:53\nWatch as Andi Petrillo takes a look at the Canada vs. Nigeria match at the FIFA Women's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.\nAfter a stint as director of soccer development in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, he had a second go-round as Australia coach from 2005 to 2012. In 2010, he led the Matildas to the AFC Women's Asian Cup, Australia's first major continental title since joining the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.\nHe took charge of the U.S. women in January 2013, eventually moving on to join the Canadian staff at Herdman's behest before becoming the first coach of the Orlando Pride in 2015.\nSermanni spent three seasons in the NWSL before taking over the New Zealand women's team on a nine-month contract that stretched into three years, eventually leaving the Football Ferns after the Tokyo Olympics.\nWhile Sermanni's career has taken him around the world, his Scottish accent remains the same. As does his penchant for crosswords.\nAlong the way, he has seen the Women's World Cup grow from 12 to 32 teams.\n\"Incredible,\" said Sermanni, recalling his '95 Australia team had just one assistant coach who doubled as the goalkeeping coach.\n\"The game's just moved on. And really in such a short space of time as well,\" he added. \"It's just amazing how it's kicked on.\"\nGame quality has 'improved significantly'\nSermanni sees \"unprecedented development\" in the women's game around the globe over the last five years, citing teams' preparation and finances.\n\"Although there are still some significant gaps, the quality of teams has gotten closer. The quality of the games has improved significantly and the development of what you would call the third- or fourth-tier teams has come on quite significantly,\" he said.\nSermanni's many connections often means facing friends and former teams.\nOpinion\nNouhaila Benzina and Morocco blazing a path of inclusion at Women's World Cup\nMore soccer coverage\nHis New Zealand side lost 2-0 to Canada at the 2019 World Cup in France and he will face the Matildas in Canada's final group game July 31 back in Melbourne.\n\"Over time it's just become part of the business, you just kind of get used to going in and trying to do the job the best you can,\" he said.\nHis connection to Canada came from Herdman, who coached in New Zealand before coming to Canada. Herdman called Sermanni once he had left the U.S. job.\n\"Which I'm eternally grateful for,\" said Sermanni, who was inducted into the Football Australia Hall of Fame in 2014.\nHe says he has no idea what his coaching future holds.\n\"I was quite happily easing into retirement when I got the call [from Canada for this World Cup] and I got the mentorship thing,\" he said. \"And I help out with a W-League team here in Australia, the Western Sydney Wanderers [where he is head of women's football].\"\n\"I don't have any ambitions,\" he added. \"I've had my time as head coach. I've had my time of chasing the game and trying to get on as far as I can in the game. I'm just really happy that I'm still involved in some capacity.\"",

The 2019 national champion struggled to sixth, revealing after that he'd had COVID-19 last week, and was still feeling the effects.\n\"Flu-like symptoms, times 10,\" Nguyen said.\nCOVID-19 has cast a pall over sports, with the surge of the new Omicron variant. Stephen Gogolev, who won silver at the 2019 nationals, withdrew on Friday after he tested positive in a PCR test upon landing in Ottawa.\nSchizas\u00a0captures gold\nMoments after clinching her first Canadian title, Schizas was asked about her goals for Beijing.\n\"My biggest goal is to avoid catching COVID,\" Schizas said. \"That's my biggest goal, for the next three weeks I'm going to do everything in my power to stay healthy.\"\nSkating to Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly,\" and dressed in dusty blue - with a sequined COVID-19 mask that she wore in the warm-up to match - the skater from Oakville, Ont., wasn't flawless in Saturday's free skate. But with a 12-point cushion from Friday's short program, her total score of 198.24 was good enough for gold and to all but clinch her spot on Canada's Olympic team.\nWATCH | Schizas wins 1st Canadian\u00a0title:\u00a0\nMadeline Schizas wins Canadian women's figure skating title\n2 years ago\nDuration \n8:35\nOakville, Ont.'s Madeline Schizas skated to first place with a final score of 126.19 in the women's free program competition during the Skate Canada National Figure Skating Championships in Ottawa.\nGilles,\u00a0Poirier win ice dance title to\u00a0secure Olympic spot\nIn ice dance, Gilles, from Toronto, and Poirier, from Unionville, Ont., secured their second trip to the Olympics with a stirring and virtually flawless performance to \"The Long and Winding Road,\" scoring 219.24 overall.\n\"We were a little nervous competing at nationals,\" Gilles said. \"We've made so many changes since the Grand Prix series. Just kind of testing out the waters a little bit. Kind of like: remember to do this, remember to do this. Nothing's on auto-pilot yet.\"\nGilles and Poirier had qualified for the Grand Prix Final last month, but it was cancelled as COVID-19 cases started to rise around the world amid the Omicron variant \u2014 a silver lining of sorts, as it gave them time to rework their program ahead of Beijing.\n\"It's all a movable feast,\" Poirier said. \"Every day in training we're making small adjustments, we're refining.

It was a triumphant comeback after a rocky first half of the season, and Moore-Towers fought back tears when they struck their final pose.\n\"We're ecstatic,\" she said. \"It wasn't perfect but it's leaps and bounds ahead of what we've done this season. Our goal was to go into Beijing as Canadian champions. This is mission accomplished for us.\"\n\"I think we officially parked [the struggles]\u00a0in the past with two performances that we're happy with,\" Marinaro added. \"We have stuff to work on in the short and the free that we'll be dialing in over the next three weeks but some rebound performances we're definitely extremely, extremely happy with.\n\"Now we've got three weeks to build, and stay COVID-free.\"\nWATCH l Moore-Towers and Marinaro capture Canadian pairs title:\n\u00a0\nMoore-Towers and Marinaro capture Canadian pairs title\n2 years ago\nDuration \n7:56\nKirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Marinaro blew the field away, winning by 26.02 points, at the National Figure Skating Championships.\nEvelyn Walsh and Trennt Michaud were second with 186.52, while Deanna Stellato and Maxime Deschamps took the bronze (178.60). Vanessa James and Eric Radford, who both contracted COVID-19 a couple of weeks ago, withdrew from Saturday's free skate.\n\"We would have loved to have the opportunity to compete against the whole event,\" Moore-Towers said of the absence of James and Radford. \"I think that would have really been the cherry on the . . . what do you say, the cherry on the cake? The ice cream? But yeah, this one is special for sure.\"\nJames and Radford, who were fourth after the short program, are still eligible to be selected for one of the two pairs berths on the Olympic team based on previous results this season, but the solid skate by Walsh and Michaud surely will make for a difficult decision.\nFor Schizas, Beijing was barely on her radar until she finished 13th at the world championships last spring.\nTHE BUZZER\nWhat to know for a big week in figure skating\n\"I am a very logical person,\" she said. \"Realistically one person is going to Olympics and the chances it was going to be me were very slim. Obviously now that I've won a Canadian title the Olympics are on my radar but I never like to get too far ahead of myself. I think one moment at a time and I think that makes it even better qualifying.\n\"In a way I don't think people expected it to be me,\" she added. \"I'm from a smaller club [Milton Skating Club], a smaller community. I don't have coaches who have necessarily done this before. We have a really great relationship and I just won my first national title.\"\nVeronik Mallet of Sept-Iles, Que., scored 170.65 for silver, while two-time Olympic and world bronze medallist Gabrielle Daleman was third (167.50).\nBecause of safety concerns and provincial crowd restrictions due to the recent COVID-19 surge, the event was held in front of no fans at TD Place Arena.\nThe Beijing Olympic figure skating team will be announced Sunday. Canada has one berth in women's singles, two in pairs and men's singles, and three in ice dance.\nNguyen struggles a week after contracting COVID-19\nNguyen\u00a0was considered a favourite to make Canada's skating team for the Beijing Olympics. But the 23-year-old from Toronto was seventh after the short program on Friday and struggled in his free program on Saturday, saying after his skate that his lungs were still feeling the effects from\u00a0COVID-19.\nMore figure skating coverage\nNguyen said he isolated for five days after his positive PCR test, and then was back on the ice on Tuesday after a negative test.\nNguyen had said a few weeks ago that he planned to retire following this season, but is rethinking that decision, saying he doesn't want to leave the sport on such a low note.",

Here's who (or what) saw their stock go up or down based on what happened:\nUp: Mika\u00ebl Kingsbury\nJapan's Ikuma Horishima injected some drama into Kingsbury's inevitable-seeming march to his 10th consecutive World Cup men's moguls title and second straight Olympic gold medal by winning two events in a row last month to steal the World Cup lead. But the GOAT returned to his rightful perch with\u00a0\nback-to-back victories\n\u00a0on his home turf at Mont-Tremblant, Que., on Friday and Saturday. Horishima finished third in both competitions to slip to second in the standings.\nThe rivals are slated to square off for the final time before the Olympics this week at Utah's Deer Valley. World Cup moguls events are scheduled there for both Thursday and Friday.\nDown: Figure skating fairness (according to some)\nThe Canadian championships in Ottawa were the final\u00a0\u2014 but not only\u00a0\u2014 audition for the Olympic team. While performances at nationals are taken into account, myriad other factors such as results this season and potential to medal in Beijing go into the decisions on who gets to fill Canada's spots.\nFor most of the events, there wasn't much difference. Canadian officials awarded the country's three ice dance berths to Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier, Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sorensen, and Marjorie Lajoie and Zachary Lagha after they finished in that order in Ottawa. The two men's spots went to winner Keegan Messing and runner-up Roman Sadovsky. Canada's lone women's entry was given to 18-year-old Madeline Schizas after she claimed her first national title. Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Marinaro landed one of the two pairs spots after winning that event.\nThe other pairs selection, though, generated controversy. It went to Vanessa James and Eric Radford, despite their withdrawal from the competition after placing fourth in the short program. That didn't sit well with those who felt runners-up Evelyn Walsh and Trennt Michaud earned the spot. But if the goal is winning an Olympic medal, the decision makes sense. James and Radford were the best Canadian pairs duo on the Grand Prix circuit, earning two fourth-place finishes (no Canadians reached the podium in pairs this season). Radford is also a proven Olympic performer, having won bronze in 2018 with former partner Meagan Duhamel before joining up with James prior to this season. Also consider that James and Radford were not at their best in Ottawa, having just returned to the ice after contracting COVID-19 around Christmas.\nIn the end, we might be splitting hairs here. Canada's chances of winning an Olympic pairs medal don't look great, no matter who goes to Beijing. The country's best hope for a figure skating medal is Gilles and Poirier, who took bronze at the world championships last year and were the only Canadians to qualify for this season's (cancelled) Grand Prix Final.

Heading into the weekend's World Cup races in Germany, Christine de Bruin looked like a good bet. She ranked No. 1 in the women's monobob, which is making its Olympic debut in Beijing, and second in the two-woman event with brakewoman Kristen Bujnowski.\nDe Bruin stumbled a bit, though, finishing eighth in the monobob and fifth in the two-woman. That dropped her to third in the two-woman standings and way down to fourth in the monobob. That event is going to be wide-open at the Olympics: a tiny number of points separates the No. 2-ranked pilot from No. 6, which happens to be Canada's Cynthia Appiah (she finished fifth on Saturday). Even the new No. 1, American Elana Meyers Tayor, holds a relatively slim lead after her victory Saturday.\nCanada's only bobsleigh medal of the weekend came from pilot Justin Kripps. The reigning Olympic two-man co-champion\u00a0\ntook bronze\n\u00a0in that event on Saturday to remain third in the World Cup standings. He's still second in the four-man after\u00a0\nplacing fifth\n\u00a0in that event on Sunday.\nUp: \u00c9liot Grondin\nCanada's best contender for an Olympic snowboard cross medal\u00a0\ntook bronze\n\u00a0and placed fifth in the pair of World Cup events held in Russia over the weekend. The 20-year-old, who finished second in the World Cup chase last season and won bronze at the world championships, ranks fourth with one stop left on the schedule before the Olympics.\nDown: Canada's bigger-name snowboarders\nBack-to-back Olympic slopestyle bronze medallist Mark McMorris and 2021 world championships silver medallist Seb Toutant both missed the podium in Saturday's World Cup event at California's Mammoth Mountain. They placed ninth and fifth, respectively. For Toutant, that was still good enough to\u00a0\nmaintain his lead in the men's standings\n. Darcy Sharpe (fourth) was the top Canadian. 2018 Olympic silver medallists Max Parrot and Laurie Blouin both opted not to compete.\nThere's one more World Cup meet for these athletes before the Olympics\u00a0\u2014 this week in Switzerland. Canada's best aren't expected to make the trip, but we could see them at the Winter X Games starting Jan. 21 in Aspen.\nCanada, meet your Olympic figure skating team\n2 years ago\nDuration \n4:44\nThat Figure Skating Show goes through Canada's Olympic figure skating team and speculates medal chances in Beijing.\nQuickly...\nNovak Djokovic won his legal battle. But the war isn't over.\n\u00a0An Australian judge today reinstated Djokovic's visa, which was cancelled last week by border officials who said the world's best tennis player didn't qualify for an exemption to the rule requiring all foreign visitors to be fully vaccinated. Djokovic's lawyers had argued that he presented a medical exemption from Tennis Australia and two medical panels, and that he didn't need to be inoculated because he recently recovered from COVID-19. The judge ordered that Djokovic be released from a quarantine hotel, allowing him to return to the practice courts in preparation for the Jan. 17-30 Australian Open. But Djokovic isn't out of the woods yet: a lawyer for the Australian government said the immigration minister \"will consider whether to exercise a personal power of cancellation\" for the visa. If that happens, Djokovic could lose a chance to break a tie with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam men's singles titles of all time.\u00a0\nRead more about the latest in the Djokovic saga here\n.\u00a0\nCanada is basking in its surprising ATP Cup victory.\n\u00a0Singles wins yesterday by Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov over their Spanish opponents gave Canada its first-ever title in the annual men's team tennis event. The Canadian squad got swept by the United States in its opening matchup but roared back to beat Germany and Great Britain to win the group before upsetting defending-champion Russia in the semis and then beating Spain in the final. Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov teamed up to win the deciding doubles match vs. Russia, which featured world No. 2 Daniil Medvedev. In the final, the 14th-ranked Shapovalov defeated No. 21 Pablo Carreno Busta before ninth-ranked Auger-Aliassime beat No. 17 Roberto Bautista Agut to clinch the victory without needing the doubles match.\u00a0\nRead more about Canada's historic win here\n.\nAnd finally...\nThe NFL season went out with a bang.\u00a0\nAt a time when other pro sports leagues are struggling to stage watchable games (or even games at all), this one just keeps churning out top-notch entertainment and drama. The final day of the regular season saw would-be Super Bowl contender Indianapolis knocked out of the playoffs with an incomprehensible loss to Jacksonville, the worst team in the league. Minutes later, Pittsburgh rose up from the dead and into the playoff picture with an overtime win over Baltimore. That set up an incredible scenario for the Sunday night season finale between the L.A. Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. The winner would make the playoffs and the loser would be eliminated \u2014\u00a0unless they tied, in which case they'd both get in and Pittsburgh would be bounced. Chaos aficionados on the internet wanted the Chargers and Raiders to kneel out the clock for 60 minutes. But, whether due to a sense of honour or maybe the pressures of the\u00a0Prisoner's Dilemma, they played it out. And thank goodness, because it turned out to be one of the most exciting games in memory. After the Chargers rallied to force OT (and stay alive in the extra frame) with several do-or-die fourth-down conversions by magical quarterback Justin Herbert, the Raiders eschewed the tie as time expired and buried L.A. with a last-second field goal. The playoffs start Saturday and you can see all the first-round matchups\u00a0here. Read more about the wild finish to the regular season\u00a0here.\nYou're up to speed. Talk to you tomorrow.",

        "content": "Nathan Chen has accomplished just about everything that one can accomplish in the sport of figure skating.\nSix consecutive national championships, the most since two-time Olympic champion Dick Button in the 1940s and '50s.\nThree consecutive world championships, the best run by an American since Scott Hamilton in the early '80s.\nNearly four years with only a single defeat, a run that includes three consecutive wins at the Grand Prix Final.\nThe only thing he's yet to accomplish? Winning Olympic gold.\nCanadian Olympic figure skating team unveiled for Beijing 2022\nThe 22-year-old Chen blew his chance four years ago in Pyeongchang, when an unusually poor short program cost him a chance at a medal; he rallied to finish fifth. But he's about to get another shot next month in Beijing, when Chen goes toe-to-toe with two-time defending gold medallist Yuzuru Hanyu and a stacked field at historic Capital Indoor Stadium.\n\"Every season my goal is to keep improving,\" Chen said after shattering his personal-best score at nationals last week. \"I'm looking forward to going back and working on whatever goals I have for the Games. I'm just enjoying this moment.\"\nWATCH | Chen claims 1st Skate Canada International victory in Vancouver:\nNathan Chen claims 1st Skate Canada International victory\n2 years ago\nDuration \n7:52\nThree-time world champion Nathan Chen of the United States claimed his first Skate Canada International men's Grand Prix title Saturday in Vancouver.\nThe showdown between Chen and Hanyu will be the highlight of the entire Olympic program.\nThe American comes armed with an array of quadruple jumps that rival anyone in the world, while his artistry takes him beyond being just an athlete to being a bona fide performer. The biggest question surrounding Chen is what programs he'll unveil in Beijing \u2014 the programs he used with mixed results earlier in the season or the programs he used at nationals, a short to \"La Boheme\" and an Elton John medley for his free skate that he used during the 2019-20 season.\n\"I'm really happy with these programs,\" Chen said, giving credit to choreographer Shae-Lynn Bourne, \"and that's why it's awesome to be able to have such amazing choreographers consistently deliver great programs for me, so it's easy to be able to go back and look through all the work she's done with me.\"\nThe sports storylines that could define the Beijing Olympics for Canadians\nHanyu withdrew from both of his Grand Prix assignments because an injured right ankle, but he dazzled last month in winning the Japanese championship. His key to victory could rest in becoming the first skater ever to land the quadruple axel \u2014 a jump that involves 4 1/2 rotations that he has landed in practice.\n\"Beijing is an extension of everything I'm doing,\" Hanyu said, \"and I know I just might have to go all in now.\"\nOthers to watch in the men's competition include Shoma Uno, the reigning Olympic silver medallist who won the NHK Trophy last fall; Vincent Zhou, the American who beat Chen at Skate America and was second to Uno at the NHK Trophy; and the Russian star Mikhail Kolyada, who finished second at his two Grand Prix assignments this season.\nCanada's entries in the competition include Keegan Messing and Roman Sadovsky.",

That Winnipeg's first professional photographer offered to trade photos for wood or flour?\nYou can find, in this paper-based Winnipeg Public Library\u00a0archive,\u00a0the seating capacity of all of Winnipeg's movie theatres\u00a0in 1978, or the minimum\u00a0wage rates for every year between 1921 (25 cents) and 2003 ($6.75).\nWelcome to the\u00a0Where File\u00a0\u2014 as in \"where can I find this?\" or \"where do I go for that?\" or \"where are those?\"\nLouis-Philippe Bujold goes through some of the entries in the Where File.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\n\"This was kind of our search engine before the Internet\u00a0was widely available,\" said\u00a0Louis-Philippe\u00a0Bujold, local history librarian at the\u00a0Millennium Library.\u00a0\n\"It represents thousands of work hours from our librarians over many years who dedicated their time to try to answer the information needed of our city's citizens and library patrons.\"\nThere's a\u00a0drawer entirely devoted to clubs and how to find\u00a0groups devoted to calligraphy, caves, dolls, pin collections, sasquatch, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Who, origami, orienteering, cats, Avon bottles.\nThere are entries for medievalists, miniatures enthusiasts, singles, sexaholics\u00a0and skeptics\u00a0\u2014 the latter\u00a0for those \"who believe the world is filled with superstitions and bizarre ideas.\"\nThe Where File was made available to the public in 2017 after decades of being accessible only to library staff.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\nThe cabinet of index cards, located on the fourth floor of the\u00a0library, was assembled by city librarians who decided to do something about the most common questions they were constantly fielding.\nThey wrote the answers on three-by-five catalogue cards, and if the answers were too long, they listed the books, magazines and newspapers \u2014 and specific pages \u2014 where the information could be found.\n\"Finding the answers to those questions sometimes involved a lot of work, so they created a catalogue that would [contain] their research\u00a0in case it was going to be needed again. Having on-hand information saved a lot of time,\" said\u00a0Bujold.\nThe business file includes an entry about the now-closed Winnipeg vintage clothing shop If You Have To Get Dressed In the Morning.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\nAs entries multiplied, more drawers were added, and cards were reassembled into subject categories.\nSometimes paper clippings were added in makeshift pockets or paper clipped to the card, while more popular subjects expanded into multiple cards stapled together.\nNever digitized\n\"Once you start looking in this, you can spend hours and find details and information you would never find otherwise,\" said Bujold, noting the information was never digitized, so most of it only exists in the file.\n\"It's a fallacy to say that everything is on the internet. That's not true. And we still use the Where File precisely because for topics that are specialized on Manitoba, you're less likely to find it anywhere else.\"\nThere's information on buildings, streets, communities,\u00a0businesses\u00a0and personalities\u00a0\u2014\u00a0musicians, artists, authors, broadcasters, actors, athletes, politicians, military commanders.\nWant to know about postal service in the pre-Winnipeg Red River Settlement or the dog-sled mail run from Norway House to Winnipeg? How about the Eaton's\u00a0Beauty Doll or\u00a0Winnipeg's connection to Playboy magazine?\nDid you know there was once\u00a0an honour, called the Order of the Gate, given to residents of Fort Garry for meritorious service to the community?\nWant to know all about the Winnipeg's bridges? The Where File will support that.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\nLike a tree's age is measured in rings, the passage of time can be seen in the ink\u00a0used for Where File entries, progressing from\u00a0fountain pens to\u00a0typewriter\u00a0ribbon\u00a0and ballpoint pens.\n\"You feel the history of the catalogue. You see that so many people contributed to it,\" said\u00a0Bujold.\n\"It's kind of a historical artifact in itself\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a physical manifestation of the topics that were of\u00a0interest to Winnipeggers during those\u00a0years.\"\nThe file on Winnipeg city history has seven cards \u2014 as does the one about the city's bridges, containing\u00a0the dates they were built, demolished and rebuilt. The oldest existing span, the Where File can tell you, is Redwood (now Harry Lazarenko Bridge) built in 1908, while the\u00a0longest is Slaw\u00a0Rebchuk\u00a0at 660.2 metres.\nThe Winnipeg drawer is flush with facts and trivia about the city.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\nIt is well known that Winnie-the-Pooh was named after Winnipeg, but did you know he was actually a she? Winnie lived until May 12, 1934, when she was euthanized at age 20. Her skull was stored at the London Zoo and put on display in 2015.\n\"If we're ever stumped by a question, the Where File has saved the day,\" said Glen Morris, an in\nformation services assistant at the library.\nWhile much of the content is Manitoba or Winnipeg-centric,\u00a0there are hundreds of other\u00a0cards on\u00a0things like the\u00a0phonetic spelling\u00a0alphabet, the\u00a0prayer for police officers and the one for fishermen, or\u00a0Lou\u00a0Brissie \u2014 the one-legged baseball player \u2014 and\u00a0parachuting.\nThe first successful jump from an airplane happened in 1912 in St. Louis, but the first creature to jump with a parachute was a dog dropped from a hot-air balloon in France in 1785.\nSome of the cards are bundled with clippings from newspapers and magazines.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\n\"It's like parts of Winnipeg's collective historical brain frozen in time,\" said\u00a0information services librarian Monique Woroniak. \"What were people researching? What school assignments might they have had?\u00a0What topics were of concern to them?\u00a0The Where File tells us that.\"\n'A\u00a0Winnipeg thing'\nThe collection\u00a0was started in the 1960s and maintained until the early 2000s. The cabinet was stored in a staff room and used exclusively by library employees.\nBujold\u00a0isn't entirely sure how many entries are in the Where File but said \"we're talking several thousands.\"\nYou'll find the Where File in the Local History Room, at the back of the stacks on the fourth floor of the Millennium Library.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\nIt was not available to the public until a few months ago, when it took up its new place in the Millennium Library's\u00a0Local History Room, prompted by suggestions from current librarians like\u00a0Woroniak.\n\"When people contact their public library and ask a question,\u00a0whether it's something straightforward or something related very personally to a need they have,\u00a0I like to think they are gifting us a little part of themselves and that it's our responsibility to care for those questions until we've found an answer, and then gift it back to the person asking,\" she said.\n\"For me, evidence of library work, like what was stored in the Where File, is evidence of care and engagement with the community.\u00a0I wanted people to see that care and even have it at their fingertips.\"\nThe entries on the cards are like miniature time capsules in themselves, going from being marked with fountain pens to ballpoint pens as the years went by.\n \n(Darren Bernhardt/CBC)\nAlthough the file hasn't been regularly updated since the early 2000s, occasionally\u00a0a librarian might add an entry on an existing card or create a new one for\u00a0a topic of significant interest.\nFor instance, a recent one is about\u00a0Faron\u00a0Hall, the man who \nbecame known as Winnipeg's homeless hero\n after he jumped into the flood-swollen Red River to rescue a teen in 2009. In 2014, Hall's body was pulled from that same river.\n\"My sister has worked in libraries across the country, from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island, and she's never heard of something called the Where File,\" said Mary Robinson, an i\nnformation services assistant.\n\"This is a Winnipeg thing.\"\nMore from the Where File\nThe font used for the motto on the City of Winnipeg crest\u00a0is\u00a0Futura Bold.\nThe first-ever movie shown in Winnipeg was \nA Magic Lantern\n\u00a0at St. John's Hall on April 5, 1861.\nThe first live theatre in Winnipeg was started by British troops\u00a0who came to Fort Garry with the Wolseley\u00a0expedition in 1870. The stage was in the store owned by Andrew McDermot\u00a0(near present-day McDermot\u00a0Avenue).\nThe first \"talkie\" was shown at the Metropolitan in October 1928.\nThe first indoor rink was on Princess Street but it\u00a0collapsed because it was structurally unsound. It was rebuilt in 1892 and the Manitoba Northwest Hockey League played there.\nThe first\u00a0Participark\u00a0\u2014 a concept combining a jogging track with exercise stations\u00a0\u2014\u00a0was located in\u00a0Transcona's\u00a0Crocus Park.\nThe last dollar bill was issued to chartered banks at 3 p.m. on June 30, 1989.\nSt. Boniface is\u00a0Winnipeg's oldest\u00a0hospital, opening in 1871 with four beds. But there was another that opened at the same time,\u00a0at the corner of\u00a0McDermot\u00a0Avenue and Albert Street. Village housewives tended to gunshot wounds, typhoid fever and malaria. The hospital\u00a0closed soon after due to a lack of funds, but was reopened in 1872 and charged $1 per day for a public bed. It\u00a0later moved locations and is now known as the Health Sciences Centre.",

        "content": "You can smell the bees before you see them.\nMixed between honey and pollen, the scent is overwhelmingly sweet as it wafts through the door in a shed placed on a rural piece of property in Amherstburg, Ont.\nWhen the door is opened that's when you hear them \u2014 thousands of bumblebees angry with the light and noise.\nThe bees are waiting to be purchased by local greenhouses that will use them for pollination.\u00a0\n\"Pollination is how much fruit you're going to get, so for a farmer, they're not going to play around with their pollination,\" said Meshal Mustafa, who helps run the family business, Growliv.\u00a0\nDr. Ghulam Mustafa and his daughter Meshal Mustafa stand inside the bumblebee room at their Amherstburg facility. \n \n(Meg Roberts/CBC)\nMustafa's parents, both entomologists, started the company in 2014 with a single bug.\u00a0\nThe company now breeds 17 species of bugs, which equates to the production of hundreds of millions of insects a week. They believe it's\u00a0the largest bug breeding farm in North America with about 36,000 square feet\u00a0of laboratory space\u00a0and annual sales of\u00a0$3.5 million.\u00a0\n\"I am known as the bug lady among my friends for sure,\" chuckled Mustafa.\u00a0\nMost of the insect species on the farm don't pollinate, they're used more as a defence mechanism \u2014 bred to eat the unwanted bugs that invade certain crops. It's a\u00a0process called biocontrol.\u00a0\nPredators versus\u00a0pesticides\u00a0\nWhite flies, for example, can stunt the production of tomatoes but green lacewing larvae, an insect Growliv breeds,\u00a0will feed on them.\nMustafa said the greenhouses usually make arrangements to buy the bugs before growing any crops.\u00a0\n\"It's a natural way to control pests without having to spray their crops with pesticides, this is like the first line of defence now,\" said Mustafa.\u00a0\nA box of bumblebees can range from $100 to $150. \n \n(Meg Roberts/CBC)\nOn top of pesticide use potentially having harmful environmental impacts, particularly when a pesticide moves outside of the intended application site,\u00a0Mustafa said pesticides can also stop working, similar to the way bacteria in humans can develop a resistance to antibiotics if taken too often and for long periods of time.\u00a0\n\"It's a similar case for\u00a0pesticides,\" she said.\u00a0\nEssex-County biocontrol is a growing industry with a \"long list of companies\"\u00a0starting to breed bugs, according to Roselyne\u00a0Labbe, a\u00a0research scientist with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the department of the federal government responsible for the federal regulation of agriculture.\nThat means millions and millions of bugs are procreated, fed, harvested, shipped and dispersed across greenhouses in the region.\u00a0\nGross? Depends on how you feel about bugs, but Labbe said it's completely safe.\u00a0\n\"A lot of them are [native]\u00a0species so they are already present anyways,\" she said.\nLabbe\u00a0also added that\u00a0once the target pest has disappeared, the predator bug\u00a0often will as well because there isn't anything to eat.\n\"It's one of the sustainable options \u2026 The government absolutely sees ecosystem resilience as a key priority. We need to have very sustainable systems for pest management,\" she said.\nGreen lacewing is a insect species sold by Growliv. They're good at locating aphid colonies and will lay their eggs there. The larval stage has a gluttonous appetite and can help in issue areas. \n \n(Growliv/Website)\nShe said if the pests are left untreated greenhouses\u00a0could incur large economic losses as greenhouses solve their pest issues.\u00a0\nMustafa said it hasn't always been easy getting farmers to change their growing ways but said her parents have been able to explain the benefit of insect predators over pesticides.\nAttributing that to hard work, dedication and a passion for creatures that don't always get a lot of love.\u00a0\n\"It opened my eyes to what is right in front of me outside that I never noticed or appreciated,\" she said.\u00a0",

        "content": "After weeks of speculation, the World Health Organization (WHO) deemed aspartame, a popular sweetener alternative to sugar, as \"possibly carcinogenic to humans\" on Thursday.\u00a0\nIn a summarized report published in The Lancet Oncology, researchers with WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\u00a0reviewed several trials and studies involving humans and\u00a0animals ingesting aspartame. They\u00a0found\u00a0\"limited\" evidence for liver cancer risks in humans.\u00a0\nWhile\u00a0a \"consistent association\" between aspartame consumption and a specific cancer type was not observed, experts say the change in designation should lead to\u00a0further research into its health impacts.\u00a0\nWHO to declare artificial sweetener aspartame a possible cancer risk, sources say\n\"We're not advising companies to withdraw products, nor we are advising consumers to stop consuming altogether.

Full reports on\u00a0the UN researchers' assessments are expected to follow in the coming months.\u00a0\nWhat is aspartame anyway, and what is it used for?\nAccording to the government of Canada,\u00a0aspartame is\u00a0a low-calorie artificial sweetener that has been\u00a0used as a food additive here since 1981. It's used in foods and beverages like\u00a0pop, breakfast cereals and chewing gum and is also used as an alternative to sugar\u00a0in caffeinated drinks.\nIt's currently used in more than 90 countries, according to the federal government,\u00a0including the United States, European nations,\u00a0Australia and New Zealand.\nWATCH | How sweeteners could lead to weight gain:\u00a0\nSweeteners and weight gain\n6 years ago\nDuration \n2:09\nA new review suggests that sweetener benefits are hard to digest\nHow does Canada currently regulate aspartame?\u00a0\nThe federal government says food additives like aspartame are subject to \"rigorous\" controls under its\u00a0Food and Drugs Act and Regulations. According to \nits website\n, officials evaluated an \"extensive\" array of toxicological tests in laboratory animals and examined the results of a number of clinical studies in humans.\u00a0\n\"There is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of foods containing this sweetener, according to the provisions of the Food and Drug Regulations and as part of a well-balanced diet, would pose a health hazard to consumers,\" Health Canada's website reads.\nScientists with the Food Directorate of Health Canada established the acceptable daily intake (ADI)\u00a0of aspartame as 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight\u00a0per day. That's the same amount as what\u00a0the FAO and WHO\u00a0joint expert committee on food additives, who weighed in on the new classification,\u00a0recommends.\nWhy caution may be warranted when consuming artificial sweeteners\nIn response to the WHO's change in designation, Health Canada said in an email to CBC News it will review the initial report\u00a0and the full assessments once released.\u00a0\n\"At that time, the department will determine whether action is needed for aspartame in Canada based on the scientific data,\" said a Health Canada spokesperson.\u00a0\n\"If the new research indicates that aspartame or any other food additive is unsafe for its permitted use, Health Canada will take action to protect Canadians, which could include reducing its maximum level of use, further restricting which foods it may be used in or no longer permitting it to be used as a food additive.\"\nShould you change your consumption habits?\u00a0\nThe IARC has a total of four classifications ranking carcinogenic hazards to humans \u2014 carcinogenic to humans, probably carcinogenic to humans, possibly carcinogenic to humans and not classifiable.\nVasanti Malik, an assistant professor teaching nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto, said\u00a0the UN designation for aspartame doesn't change her understanding of the current literature. She compared the designation to that\u00a0of\u00a0red meat, which is deemed a \"probable carcinogen.\"\n\"We really need strong research that can look at the different sweeteners independently over time, and that's not how the studies were done,\"\u00a0said Malik.\nDavid Ma, left, is a human health and nutritional sciences professor at the University of Guelph. Vasanti Malik is an assistant professor teaching nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto.\n \n(University of Guelph and University of Toronto)\nUnder Health Canada's current guidance,\u00a0the average adult needs to drink about 14 cans of Diet Coke to hit their acceptable daily intake of aspartame, Malik said. While that may be \"crazy\" to visualize, she said people should keep track of where else aspartame\u00a0may appear in their diets, such as yogurt and desserts.\n\"We know we want to cut sugar down in the diet and artificial sweeteners are part of that,\" she said.\nConsumers should use sweeteners like aspartame mostly as an interim alternative to weaning off sugar, said David Ma, a human health and nutritional sciences professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario.\nWhile aspartame usually appears in \"small\" and \"acceptable\" amounts, he said people should still seek healthier alternatives.\u00a0\n\"The simple message is that there's not too much to worry about,\" said Ma. \"If you are [worried], there are alternatives, drink more water or other healthy beverages.\"",

        "content": "Las Vegas police confirmed Tuesday that they served a search warrant this week in connection with the long-unsolved killing of Tupac Shakur, propelling the case back into the spotlight nearly 30 years after his death.\nShakur, one of the most celebrated figures in the history of hip-hop, was killed on the night of Sept. 7, 1996, in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. He was 25.\nNo arrests have ever been made. Yet attention on the case, which has seen its share of conspiracy theories, has endured for decades.\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement that the search was conducted Monday in the nearby city of Henderson. It's unclear what they were looking for and where they were looking.\nCiting the ongoing investigation, department spokesperson Aden OcampoGomez said in a brief phone call that he couldn't provide further details on the latest development in the case, including whether a suspect has been identified.\nWhat happened the night of his killing\nThe 25-year-old rapper was travelling in a black BMW driven by Death Row Records founder Marion (Suge) Knight in a convoy of about 10 cars, apparently headed to a nightclub, after watching Mike Tyson knock out Bruce Seldon in a heavyweight championship fight at the MGM Grand. Police said no one else was in the car with them.\nA white Cadillac with four men inside pulled alongside the BMW while it was stopped at a red light at an intersection near the Las Vegas Strip, and one person opened fire, riddling the passenger side of Knight's car with bullets, police said. Sitting in the passenger seat, Shakur was shot four times, at least twice in the chest. Knight was grazed by a bullet fragment or shrapnel from the car.\nShakur, left, is shown on Aug. 15, 1996, alongside Marion (Suge) Knight, then the chairman of Death Row Records. Knight, who was inside the vehicle where Shakur was fatally shot, is currently in prison after being convicted of manslaughter in another case.\n \n(Frank Wiese/The Associated Press)\nShakur was rushed to a hospital, where fans stood outside in vigil. He died six days after the shooting.\nUpon leaving the MGM Grand the fateful night, Shakur and Knight were embroiled in a multiperson brawl inside the casino. Among the individuals they fought with was Los Angeles native Orlando Anderson, 22.\nAnderson was questioned both in the Shakur probe and in connection with unrelated shootings in Los Angeles. He gave an interview to the Los Angeles Times denying any role in the Shakur homicide and professing to be a fan of the artist.\nCommotion\nIs Disney+'s Dear Mama the best Tupac documentary yet?\nDead celebrities are being digitally resurrected \u2014 and the ethics are murky\nThe rapper's mother,\u00a0Afeni Shakur, through her attorney, gave notice that she planned to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Anderson in early 1998.\u00a0\nBut in May of that year, Anderson was among three men fatally shot in a gunfight outside a Compton, Calif., car wash.\nA period of deadly hip-hop violence\nShakur's death came amid his feud with rap rival the Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Wallace, and Wallace's label boss at Bad Boy Records, Sean (Diddy) Combs.\u00a0\nShakur was seriously wounded in another shooting during a robbery in the lobby of a midtown Manhattan hotel in 1994. He was shot several times and lost $40,000 US. He openly accused Wallace and Combs of having prior knowledge of the shooting, which both vehemently denied. The shooting sparked an East Coast-West Coast feud that created a serious divide within the hip-hop community and fans.\nIn this Dec. 6, 1995, photo, Notorious B.I.G. celebrates at the Billboard Music Awards in New York. The rapper was shot to death less than a year after the killing of Shakur.\n \n(Mark Lennihan/The Associated Press)\nDiss tracks were seemingly delivered to drive home their points. Shakur released the aggressive single \nHit 'Em Up\n, which took aim at Wallace, who recorded \nWho Shot Ya?\n, an early 1995 record that was received as a taunt. However, Wallace claimed the song was not directed toward Shakur.\nWallace was also gunned down while inside a vehicle, on March 9, 1997, in Los Angeles after attending the Soul Train Awards. As with the Shakur case, no one has ever been brought to trial in connection with the homicide.\nWhile Combs has carried on as a performer and businessman, Knight is currently serving a manslaughter sentence in connection with a fatal 2015 hit-and-run.\nSeveral documentaries and miniseries have dealt with the speculation around who could be responsible for the killings of Shakur and Wallace, with friends of the performers and even former police officers detailing missteps in the two homicide investigations.\nShakur's artistic legacy\nShakur is one of the most prolific figures in hip-hop, also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli.\nHis professional music career only lasted five years, but he sold more than 75 million records worldwide.\nFans attend a ceremony on June 7 in Los Angeles, during which Shakur received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n \n(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)\nHe was born June 16, 1971, in New York City. In his teens, he attended the Baltimore School for the Arts, at the same time as actress Jada Pinkett Smith.\nAfter moving to California and joining the Grammy-nominated group Digital Underground, Shakur struck out on his own and achieved recognition with \n2Pacalypse Now\n, released in late 1991.\nLISTEN l Music historian Jeffrey Ogbar on Shakur's legacy (2021):\n\u00a0\nDay 6\n6:39\nUnpacking Tupac's complicated legacy, on what would have been his 50th birthday\nTupac Shakur was the son of a Black Panther, a classically trained actor and a superstar rapper who challenged police violence, systemic racism and poverty \u2014 but also wrote misogynist music and was convicted of sexually abusing a fan. Experts say the complications that made him so compelling in life have kept his legacy alive and well.\nThe Las Vegas shooting occurred as Shakur's fourth solo album, \nAll Eyez on Me\n, remained on the charts, with some five\u00a0million copies sold. Several posthumous releases were also big sellers.\nShakur was also praised for his onscreen work in an acting career that saw him feature in several popular films such as John Singleton's \nPoetic Justice\n with Janet Jackson and Ernest Dickerson's \nJuice\n.\nThe six-time Grammy-nominated artist was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame by Snoop Dogg in 2017.\nJust last month, Shakur received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",

It also includes scenes shot in front of a courthouse in Colombia, Tenn., that was the site of a lynching of a Black man in the 1920s, according to a report by Variety.\nOn social media, Aldean defended the song.\n\"I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to\u00a0the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests. These references are not only meritless, but dangerous,\" he wrote in post to his Instagram Stories.\n\"There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it \u2014 and there isn't a single video clip that isn't real news footage \u2014 and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music \u2014 this one goes too far.\"\nCountry star Sheryl Crow spoke out about the song, saying she was from a small town.\n\"Even people in small towns are sick of violence. There's nothing small-town or American about promoting violence,\" she tweeted. \"You should know that better than anyone having survived a mass shooting. This is not American or small town-like. It's just lame.\"\u00a0\nThe single is taken from Aldean's upcoming album.\nThe CMT channel in Canada is owned jointly by Corus Entertainment and Paramount Networks Americas.

He bought a house in Calgary in 2018 on a five-year, fixed rate loan, at about three per cent.\nHe went with a 25-year term, and\u00a0because he chose an accelerated biweekly payment plan, each one of his $750 payments had him well on his way\u00a0toward paying it down well ahead of schedule.\nBy the time his loan was up for renewal this year, he was on track to pay it off in as little as 15\u00a0more years, after having made a few extra payments along the way.\nThe bad news, of course, was that his loan renewal was timed to coincide with the most \naggressive campaign of rate hikes\n since the Bank of Canada started targeting inflation in the first place, taking the central bank's rate from 0.25 per cent in February 2022\u00a0to five per cent today.\nHe discussed his options with his mortgage broker and, not liking the look of a lot of what he was seeing, he settled on another fixed rate loan at just under five per cent. It works out to a 26 per cent increase on what he was previously paying, though, for him, the peace of mind was worth it to lock in.\n\"It's a couple grand a year more,\" he told CBC News in an interview. \"But I went fixed again because with the chaos, I don't think it's getting better any time soon.\"\nMillions of Canadians may be inclined to agree. According to official figures, there are currently six million residential mortgages in Canada right now, and about 1.2 million of them come\u00a0up for renewal every year. About one-third of all mortgage holders have already seen their rates increase, and \neveryone else should expect to start paying more soon\n.\nMortgage broker Ron Butler says anyone with a mortgage should brace for much higher rates and payments\u00a0than they were probably ever expecting. \"In some cases, double the rate they were experiencing and nothing but bigger payments moving forward,\" he said.\nThousands more dollars a year\nThe numbers add up fast. Prior to the recent rate hikes, if you were lucky, you could have signed a variable rate loan at about one\u00a0per cent in January\u00a02022.\u00a0At that rate, a $400,000, 25-year mortgage would cost $1,507\u00a0a month.\nIf that mortgage went up in lockstep with the Bank of Canada's hikes, by last week, that loan was sitting at 5.75 per cent and costing $2,500 a month. This week's hike would have\u00a0tacked on another $59.\nAdd it all up, and that's more than $12,600 extra each year.\nLately, Butler says he hears daily from borrowers with a desperation in their voice he's never heard before.\n\"We take calls from some people who are actually in tears,\" he said. \"They've got a renewal [and] they don't know what they're going to do.\"\nMortgage broker Ron Butler says homeowners should brace for drastically higher payments moving forward.\n \n(Keith Burgess/CBC)\nButler said lenders have been delaying some of the payment shock for many borrowers by extending amortizations. That brings relief upfront by keeping monthly payments steady, but it tacks on years to the life of the mortgage by effectively turning them into interest-only loans.\n\"We hear these stories about 70-year amortization, 90-year amortization \u2014 instead of paying off your mortgage, these people's mortgages are actually getting bigger,\" Butler said.\u00a0\nBut that doesn't work forever, as the debt\u00a0has to be paid back under possibly worse terms later.\n\"At renewal \u2026\u00a0those rates, those payments are going to go up,\" Butler said.\nWATCH | Why some mortgages are getting bigger, even as you make your payments:\n\u2018Mortgage prison\u2019: Trigger rates and negative amortization explained | About That\n5 months ago\nDuration \n8:09\nVariable-rate mortgages can be high-risk and high-reward. But what happens when it doesn\u2019t pay off? Andrew Chang explains trigger rates, negative amortization and how homeowners can actually lose equity while still making payments.\nKara Hishon knows that first-hand. She lives in Stratford, Ont., with her husband and three kids. They bought their family home in the summer of 2018 on a fixed-rate loan at 2.8 per cent, which\u00a0kept the payments well within their budget. While they love everything about their home, the same can't be said of the loan options she's\u00a0been presented with now that their five-year term is up.\nHishon says she's shopped around, but rates from other lenders are all about double her current rate, so she's leaning toward re-upping with her existing lender, at\u00a05.75 per cent.\nThat's going to add about $400 a month to their mortgage costs\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and comes with another catch: In order to keep the payments comparable, they've had to undo the\u00a0diligent work they've done to get their original loan down to 16 years, and re-amortize at 30 years.\n\"It's kind of a bummer to have to forego that,\" she said\u00a0in an interview, \"but there's no way we could have done it otherwise.\"\nKara Hishon, her husband, Bill, and her sons, Bruce, Kohen and Brooks, live in Stratford, Ont. They are renewing their mortgage and the massive jump in rates has meant adding years to their loan in order to stay on top of its financing.\n \n(Submitted by Kara Hishon)\nThe loan has one more unconventional wrinkle to it in that it is for a three-year term, as the Hishon family are hopeful to be able to renegotiate on better terms then.\nThere's a lot of that sort of sentiment out there. Typically, fixed rate loans are the most popular option for buyers, especially first-time buyers.\u00a0But the Bank of Canada's decision to slash interest rates to near-zero during the pandemic caused many to flock to variable rate ones.\nAnalysis\nThe painful end of free money as real interest rates start to rise\nBank of Canada raises its key interest rate to 5%\nPersonal finance author Preet Banerjee says variable loans typically have lower rates than fixed ones because of the peace of mind that comes from locking in.\n\"A\u00a0lot of people will actually put a premium on predictability, and that's normally what you're paying for with a fixed rate,\" he said. \"But that premium between variable versus fixed rates, it's upside down right now,\" which is why more and more people are choosing the peace of mind of predictable fixed rates, but for a shorter period so they get to try for a better deal once things inevitably settle down.\nWhile there is no magic bullet that's going to bring borrowing rates down to the levels seen from 2020 to 2022, Banerjee's advice to those renewing is to make sure you do your homework, seek the help of a broker and don't just blindly sign the renewal notice your lender sends you.\n\"The sooner you start looking at your options, the better.\"\nFinancial expert Preet Banerjee says anyone renewing a mortgage right now needs to start the process early to have a chance of getting the best deal possible.\n \n(CBC)\nLeticia\u00a0Lam did exactly that.\nShe lives in Toronto with her brother and retired parents, and as the main earner in the family, she took it upon herself to start shopping around earlier this year for a new loan on the house they bought in 2019.\nShe has a few more weeks before renewal, but she knows the four-year term at 2.79 per cent she got last time won't exist, and she may be facing a rate that starts with a five, six \u2014 or more.\n\"The rate will\u00a0more than double, so my monthly payment will\u00a0increase at least $600 to $1,000 every month,\" she said.\nHow does increasing interest rates actually help curb inflation?\nWhy rent is so expensive in 3 Canadian cities (that aren't Toronto or Vancouver)\nAs an engineer, she knows she has a higher income than most, but she and her brother have had to cut expenses and try to make money on the side to keep the roof over their head.\nWATCH | Some homeowners are extending\u00a0the length of their\u00a0mortgages:\n\u00a0\nWhat to consider when renewing your mortgage at a higher rate\n12 days ago\nDuration \n1:50\nWith four million Canadian mortgages due to renew by 2026, many borrowers are having to contend with higher interest rates for the first time. Experts weigh in on what options you have to lessen the pain.\n\"It's still tight,\" she said. \"My salary doesn't increase based on inflation.\"\nShe's resigned to signing up for the best deal she can find when her loan is up later this summer, and while she says she has no option but to make it work, she's questioning why people like her are having to pay the price to bring down inflation for everyone.\u00a0\n\"The rich get richer and everybody\u00a0else gets poorer,\" she said. \"It's not sustainable.\"\nInterest rates have skyrocketed.

Barron calls it a \"battery in a rock\" \u2014 another pitch line.\nRegistered in Canada, The Metals Company (TMC) is operationally an international mining start-up headed up by Barron, an Australian.\u00a0\nDressed in a navy T-shirt and designer sneakers, Barron is in his mid-50s and gave off an air of part-prospector, part-promoter when CBC met him in late June by the ocean in Los Angeles, a pit stop in his international travels to sell deep sea mining to a wary public.\nGerard Barron, the CEO of The Metals Company, holds a piece of a polymetallic nodule laced with high concentrations of nickel and copper, along with cobalt and manganese.\n \n(Andrew Lee/CBC)\n\"What we need are base metals so that we can build batteries and wind turbines and solar panels so we can move away from fossil fuels and address climate change and global warming,\" says Barron.\nBut to get them, TMC is going to vacuum the bottom of the sea in two parcels in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ), a 4.5-million-square-kilometre area in the Pacific Ocean partway between Mexico and Hawaii.\nMurky waters: The environmental risks of deep sea mining\nThere are potentially big profits in the CCZ, one of the richest areas for nodules in the world's oceans.\u00a0\n\"The reason they want to mine the deep seabed is not to protect the Earth from climate change,\" said Catherine Coumans, research co-ordinator at MiningWatch Canada. \"They want to mine the deep sea because they want to make a profit.\"\nThis month, high-stakes international negotiations in Kingston, Jamaica, hosted by the International Seabed Authority could determine the future of deep sea mining and whether TMC can successfully pursue a permit this year to mine commercially.\u00a0\nBarron, who is in Kingston all month, is staring down a growing chorus of critics, including environmentalists and marine scientists who warn of irreversible damage, as well as a number of skeptical countries, including Canada, which signalled this week that it supports a \"pause\" on exploitation.\u00a0\nMassive deposits\nTrillions of polymetallic nodules lie on the seafloor \u2014 \"like golf balls on a driving range,\" says Barron. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the nodules in the CCZ could hold more critical metals than all of the world's terrestrial reserves.\nWhile this \"green rush\" to the bottom has attracted about a dozen competing companies and countries, TMC is leading the charge.\u00a0\nLast October, the company, with its partner Allseas, lowered an 80-tonne robotic \"collector\" to the ocean floor in exploration trials. Fitted with tracks, the vehicle rolled along the seabed sucking up nodules and everything else in its path.\nBarron insists that the impact in the ocean is reduced compared with the bulldozing and blasting that takes place in terrestrial mines. But the robotic collector vehicle stirred up sediment, creating big plumes before the nodules travelled up a 4.5-kilometre-long riser\u00a0to the surface.\nAllseas retrofitted a former deepwater drill ship \u2014 renaming it The Hidden Gem \u2014 to do the trials, collecting 3,200 tonnes of rock.\nWATCH | The rover that scoops the mineral-rich nodules off the ocean floor:\nRetrieving deep sea nodules\n14 days ago\nDuration \n1:19\nA rover on the ocean floor brings nodules studded with critical minerals up onto the mining ship.\n\"This one is about four million years old,\" said Barron, caressing the nodule in his hand.\nBut this is exactly the point, said Coumans. \"This is an ecosystem that took millions of years to form and it has been untouched by human activity and it will take millions of years for this ecosystem to come back.\"\nMining it \"is so destructive and so irreversible,\" she said.\nSurging demand\nBut it's clear that to meet decarbonization goals, the world will need more critical minerals.\nJosipa Petrunic, president and CEO of the Canadian Urban Transit Research and Innovation Consortium, said electric vehicles are \"growing rapidly in Canada and globally.\"\u00a0\nThe International Energy Agency estimates the world will need 19 times more nickel by 2040 to meet its decarbonization targets. Indonesia, the world's biggest nickel supplier, is bulldozing rainforests to expand mines.\n\"It is essentially like a gold rush \u2014 the exploration of the unknown without a lot of regulatory oversight right now, with the potential for billions and billions of dollars in profit,\" said Petrunic.\nAn increase in domestic electric vehicle production has been a priority for the Canadian government. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is seen at an announcement on a Volkswagen electric vehicle battery plant in St. Thomas, Ont., in April 2023. \n \n(The Canadian Press/Tara Walton)\nBut some marine scientists are climbing onboard an international campaign to stop the moves toward commercial mining.\nMore than 700 marine scientists and policy experts signed \nan open letter\n in 2021 stating \"we strongly recommend that the transition to the exploitation of mineral resources be paused.\"\nLast month, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council \nechoed the warning\n: \n\"\nWe should pause to reflect instead of rushing to an early decision that will later be regretted,\" wrote Peter Haugan, policy director at the Institute for Marine Research in Bergen, Norway.\nA habitat for unique sea creatures\nEarlier this year, Diva Amon, a marine biologist from Trinidad and Tobago wrote an op-ed in the New York Times titled, \n\"A rush to mine the deep sea is underway. It must be stopped.\"\n\"For me, using deep sea mining to help fight the climate crisis is like smoking to lower stress,\" Amon told CBC News during a visit to Vancouver.\u00a0\nContrary to the image of the deep sea as dark and lifeless, she says it is actually full of creatures who survive without light and at low oxygen levels.\u00a0\nDiva Amon, a deep sea marine biologist from Trinidad and Tobago, says the deep sea is full of creatures who survive without light and at low oxygen levels. \n \n(JAMSTEC/UH/TMC)\n\"It looks like something from a Dr. Seuss novel \u2014 just this weird, wonderful, colourful but still just incredibly amazing life.\"\nIn May, scientists at the Natural History Museum in London released a database of new species discovered in the CCZ, including 5,000 that had never before been formally identified, like a mauve-coloired creature nicknamed \"gummy squirrel.\"\u00a0\nIn a statement, museum researcher Adrian Glover said, \"It is imperative that we work with the companies looking to mine these resources to ensure any such activity is done in a way that limits its impact upon the natural world.\"\nWATCH | The deep sea is home to creatures that require little light or oxygen:\nDeep sea creatures\n14 days ago\nDuration \n0:31\nSeabed mining in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific could harm sea creatures, environmentalists say.\nAmon argues mining is \"short-term action that will cause long-term damage\" to oceans, \"which are critical for absorbing heat and sequestering carbon and storing it away for millions of years.\"\nNot all countries on board\nBarron admits he's not \"feelin' the love\" from his many critics. But he and The Metals Company also dispute many of the \"desktop predictions\" being fired his way.\u00a0\nHe says TMC has spent $150 million US so far on scientific research and assessing the environmental impact. In fact, about 80 scientists and researchers went out on the exploration trials in the Pacific last year.\nDiva Amon, a deep sea marine biologist from Trinidad and Tobago, said mining the deep seas to help fight the climate crisis 'is like smoking to lower stress.'\n \n(Martin Diotte/CBC)\nThe company says the sediment plumes will not travel as far or as high in the water column, as claimed, and the noise from the mining is mostly at the surface.\u00a0\nHe's called the opposition \"noise,\" and claims \"the debate over deep sea mining is over, done.\"\nThat point is hyperbole, if the talks in Jamaica this month are any indication. The politics are thick at meetings of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), which grew out of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.\u00a0\nCreated in 1994, the ISA regulates activities in international waters, guided by its 167 member nations, plus the European Union.\u00a0\nThe ISA has been trying to come up with regulations \u2014 a mining code \u2014 but it's come up against a deadline, what's called the \"two-year rule.\"\u00a0 \nTMC partnered with the tiny island country of Nauru, which triggered the rule in 2021. The deadline passed last Sunday, meaning the ISA is obligated to consider applications for commercial mining.\nBarron says his company will apply near the end of this year. But with mining regulations still not in place, a growing number of countries and observers are firmly opposed to fast-tracking permits.\nCanada taking\u00a0wait-and-see approach\nOn Monday, Canada announced it supported an interim moratorium on deep sea mining, essentially signalling it would not agree to mining regulations until it had seen more science on how to do it with the least impact on the environment.\nGreenpeace protesters demonstrate against deep sea mining near a ship operated by Allseas called The Hidden Gem.\n \n(Gustavo Graf/Greenpeace)\nCanadian Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, along with the ministers of Fisheries and Oceans and Global Affairs Canada, released a statement clarifying their position.\n\u00a0\"We recognize the importance of marine ecosystems as a climate regulator, and will continue to take and advocate for a precautionary approach to development.\"\nIn an interview with CBC News, Wilkinson said \"it's not 'no' forever,\" but that there's a lot more science that needs to be done.\n\"It may well be that after we accumulate the science, that we actually make a decision that this can be done in a certain way, perhaps in certain places, but I'm not going to prejudge that,\" he said.\nMinister of Natural Resources Jonathan Wilkinson has said that more science needs to be done to ensure the safety of seabed mining on marine ecosystems.\n \n(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\nEnvironmental groups who've been advocating for more countries to sign onto a moratorium applauded Canada's stance.\n\"\nWe definitely see it as a small win and a step in the right direction,\" said Sarah King, head of Greenpeace Canada's Oceans and Plastics campaign. \"Every country that voices opposition to this industry sends a signal that it's unacceptable that we allow a destructive industry to proceed.\"\nPetrunic said mining is inherently \"dirty\" no matter where it occurs.\n\"There's no pretty picture to mining, whether it's under the water or above ground. And our question to ourselves, as Canadians and internationally, is how much destruction are we willing to accept in the interest of decarbonizing?\"\nGerard Barron remains undeterred. When asked what will happen if the ISA decides to pause or block his company's application for commercial mining, he waved it away.\n\"I rate that as 0.1 of one percent chance,\" he says, the final point in his pitch.",

He died at the height of his fame due to an allergic reaction to painkillers when he was 32.\nThe 50th anniversary of Lee's death on Thursday drew fans to exhibitions in Hong Kong on his life and career. They also laid flowers at his statue at the Avenue of Stars, a tourist attraction modelled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on the Kowloon shore of Victoria Harbour.\nFans gather in front of the statue of martial artist Bruce Lee to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death in Hong Kong on Thursday.\n \n(Louise Delmotte/The Associated Press)\nA government-run museum organized a camp for students to learn about Lee's legacy by introducing them to Jeet Kune Do, the martial arts style that Lee invented and practised. The museum also screened his films.\nMany of Lee's supporters said his philosophy inspired them since they were young, even though many only learned about him and his works after his death.\nSophie Uekawa, a translator, said she was initially attracted to Lee's muscular body and smooth moves on TV. But she was later impressed by his words, including about how unhappy circumstances eventually pass. When Uekawa was bullied by schoolmates in secondary school, Lee's quotes helped her endure feelings of helplessness.\n\"It can be said that he is my saviour,\" Uekawa said.\nIn this photo taken on Tuesday, a woman pushes a cart with cardboard boxes past a mural of Lee in Hong Kong.\n \n(Bertha Wang/AFP/Getty Images)\nLee began his career as a child actor in the 1940s and started learning Chinese kung fu when he was 13. He moved back to the U.S. in 1959 and studied philosophy at the University of Washington.\nThe superstar fought hard against racist stereotypes in the U.S. entertainment industry where Asian men were often portrayed as servants, unskilled workers or evil geniuses in Hollywood.\nFan club leader hopes more younger fans emerge\nLee eventually went back to Hong Kong and made hits like \nThe Big Boss \nand \nFist of Fury\n. His last film,\n Enter the Dragon\n, was released six days after his death and became his most popular movie. He was one of the first Asian actors to attain Hollywood megastardom and fanned a kung fu craze that swept the world.\nOn Thursday, W Wong, the chairperson of a Bruce Lee fan club in Hong Kong, was touched to see fans from different countries including Britain and Korea gathering at Lee's statue to pay tribute to him.\nA visitor takes a photo of the wax figure of Lee at the Madame Tussauds wax museum in Hong Kong on Tuesday.

        "content": "The long black streaks in the hills along Highway 40 outside Grande Cache, Alta., are a clear sign of the rich coal seams that run through the eastern slopes of the Rockies there.\u00a0\nThe community, about 430 kilometres northwest of Edmonton, was established in the 1960s to serve the mine that still pulls coal out of the ground outside town. The volatile coal industry has fuelled the local economy from the beginning.\nIn recent years as coal fired power plants were phased out across Alberta, the future of the town's existing mine became more uncertain. The local power plant was converted from coal to primarily natural gas in 2019.\u00a0\nOnly the continued demand for metallurgical coal to make steel overseas has kept the mine going. There is now a proposal to build a new mine in the area to produce more coal for steel making, a project that has some people in Grande Cache thinking twice.\nThe Summit 14 mine, proposed by Maxim Power, would be built on Grande Mountain which looms large over Grande Cache.\u00a0\nCST Canada Coal Limited\u2019s existing coal mine operates just outside of Grande Cache, Alta. Another company, Maxim Power, is proposing to build a new mine near the existing facility in order to meet demand for metallurgical coal to make steel overseas.\n \n(Josh Mclean/CBC News)\nFears for tourism, pollution\nThe potential mine site is also visible through the trees of Jules Desrocher's camp ground and trail riding business.\n\"The haul road is going to come across what we are looking at \u2014\u00a0right on Grande Mountain,\"\u00a0he says, pointing to the potential mine site in the distance.\nDesrocher worries\u00a0tourists will stop coming to enjoy the natural beauty of the area if there is a coal mine overlooking his operation.\nCBC Explains\nWhat is metallurgical coal-making, the industry that ex-premier John Horgan is now a part of?\nAnalysis\nCaught between climate warnings and economic realities, Canada and the world face tough fossil fuel choices\nThe Metis entrepreneur also has concerns about what the mine will mean for drinking water in the area.\nDesrocher, who also works part time in the oil and gas sector, is quick to point out that he is not anti-industry. But he says there are too many unknowns when it comes to the new mine proposal.\n'A good thing for the town of Grande Cache tax wise'\nIn Grande Cache, at a packed open house about the proposed mine held in July, questions about its environmental impact are top of mind for many in attendance.\nMaxim Power, the company pitching the new project, says that the mine will be underground, meaning local water will be more protected than in a surface mine.\nResidents of Grand Cache, Alta., gather at a meeting to learn more about a coal mine proposed for the area. Many local business owners welcomed the proposal as a way to create jobs and expand the tax base. \n \n(Josh Mclean/CBC News)\nKyle Mitton of Maxim Power adds that the company has to do \"the environmental monitoring and demonstrate that this will be a responsible operation,\" before it is given the green light to build the mine by the province.\nIf the company does receive the permits it needs, the mine could be producing metallurgical coal by the end of next year.\nIt is a prospect that many at the open house, including local businessman Anthony Yakielashek, support.\u00a0\nAnalysis\nLithium extraction could be a boon for Alberta, but it comes with environmental uncertainties\n\"This is a good thing for the town of Grande Cache tax wise \u2014\u00a0to keep the town going,\"\u00a0Yakielashek says.\nProject could create 120 new jobs\nThe Alberta government had flirted with the idea of opening several new metallurgical mines in the province in recent years. However, strong public opposition forced most of the projects to be shelved.\u00a0\nThe Summit 14 mine was the exception, grandfathered because it had been in the works since 2008.\u00a0\nThe town of Grande Cache, Alta., has long been powered by jobs in the coal industry and many residents support the new mine proposal.\n \n(Josh Mclean/CBC News)\n\"There are multiple approval steps remaining for this project but its approval would provide economic security for the Grande Cache area,\" said a spokesperson for the Alberta Ministry of Energy and Minerals.\nThe local Chamber of Commerce agrees, noting that bringing, \"employment for an estimated 120 workers into the Grande Cache economy would be great.\"\nBut if the mine is built it would alter the landscape of Grande Mountain, and some worry it could impact the area's budding tourism sector.\n'Something special about this area'\nGina Goldie, who grew up in Grande Cache, started her river rafting company in the area 25 years ago.\u00a0\"There is just something special about this area, it is just so quiet and serene and beautiful,\"\u00a0she says.\nLike many people from Grande Cache, Goldie is conflicted about the new mine, recognizing the environmental risks but also aware of the economic benefits.\u00a0\nGrande Cache resident Gina Goldie started Wild Blue Yonder Rafting 25 years ago. She has mixed feelings about a potential new mine in the area.  \n \n(Josh Mclean/CBC News)\n\"So in an ideal world we are not using coal mines anymore\u00a0\u2014 but we don't live in that world, we are at the precipice of serious climate problems and so how do we solve those \u2014\u00a0that is a very big complex problem.\"\nGoldie is most worried about the reclamation of the mine site once it is done producing coal. She also\u00a0has concerns about the ability for regulators to make sure the site is cleaned up.\nStill, she says the fact that the mine is producing coal for steel manufacturing, and not electricity production, is an important distinction, since there are currently no viable alternatives.\u00a0\nThe area around Grand Cache is known for its natural attractions and new businesses focused on tourism have been growing. \n \n(Josh Mclean/CBC News)\n\"There has got to be a balance struck between preservation of our natural areas and use of our natural resources and I think that is the challenge,\"\u00a0Goldie says.\nGoldie points out that the steel produced from Grande Cache's coal seams could be used to build wind turbines or electric cars, key pieces to decarbonizing the planet and addressing climate change.\u00a0\nAs the Summit 14 mine continues to move its way through the approval process, people in the area say they're wrestling with how the coal industry and the environment can coexist, unearthing\u00a0no easy answers \u2014 only hard questions about the future of their town.",

        "summary": "Canada's inflation rate fell to 2.8 per cent in June, its lowest level in more than two years.",
        "content": "Canada's\u00a0inflation rate fell to 2.8 per cent in June, its lowest level in more than two years.\nStatistics Canada said a sharp decline in the price of gasoline compared with\u00a0this time last year was the biggest reason for the drop, which brought Canada's official inflation rate down to its lowest point since March 2021.\nGasoline prices were 21 per cent lower during the month than they were the same month a year earlier.\nAnother factor pushing down the increase in the cost of living was telecommunications services, which fell by\u00a014.7 per cent compared with\u00a0what they were a year ago.\n\"This was a result of both lower prices for cellular data plans and promotional pricing,\" Statistics Canada said.\nPrices for internet access fall\nRogers \nfinalized its purchase of rival Shaw\n in April, and at least in the short term, the result has been a flurry of promotional offers between the telecom giants.\nThe data agency noted that prices for internet access fell by 3.2 per cent in the past year\u00a0and by five per cent in the month of June alone \u2014 the biggest one-month plunge since 2019.\n\"This was mostly due to promotions in Ontario and lower prices in Quebec,\" Statistics Canada\u00a0said.\nOn the other side of the ledger, food and mortgage costs were the biggest single factors pushing the rate higher. The cost of food continues to increase at a pace of more than nine per cent. Coming on the heels of the annual increase up to June of last year, that means the price of food has gone up\u00a0by almost 20 per cent in two years. That's the fastest pace of increase in the price to fill up a grocery cart\u00a0in more than 40 years.\nClaire Fan, an economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, says despite remaining stubbornly high, there's reason to hope that food prices will soon come down because most of the global factors that caused them to spike in the first place are dissipating.\nRoyal Bank economist Claire Fan says there are plenty of reasons to expect increases in food prices to start slowing soon.\n \n(Craig Chivers/CBC)\n\"It's taking a bit longer for those domestically added pressure to food prices to come down, but they have come down and they will continue to,\" Fan told CBC News in an interview.\nAnd mortgage interest costs are also making things a lot more expensive, up\u00a0by more than 30 per cent in the past year. Mortgage rates have skyrocketed as a direct result of the Bank of Canada's campaign to tame inflation, but there's little relief for renters, either.\nStatistics Canada says rent has increased by 5.8 per cent in the past year, which is the second-biggest\u00a0single contributor to the higher inflation rate in the past year, behind mortgage costs.\nCalgarian\u00a0Stephanie Haynes\u00a0has had to deal with an increase more than five times that amount, with her landlord telling her recently that the rent on her two-bedroom apartment would increase by more than $400 a month from the $1,550 she was paying previously.\nCalgarian Stephanie Haynes says her rent has gone up by more than 30 per cent this year.\n \n(Anis Heydari/CBC)\n\"I actually didn't believe it when I first got it,\" she told CBC\u00a0News. \"I had to read it three times to make sure ... what I was reading \u2014\u00a0I actually was in shock.\"\nHaynes\u00a0said she spent months trying to find alternatives but was shocked to discover prices were the same everywhere she looked. So she's been left with no alternative but to pay it \u2014 and then try to cut her expenses where she can.\n\"I have enough money to survive, but not enough money to thrive,\" she said. \"I have to look at all of my bills that are coming out and budget accordingly.\"\nThe fresh inflation data comes just days after the Bank of Canada decided to hike its benchmark interest rate, for the 10th time in little more than a year, as part of its campaign to wrestle inflation into submission.\nWATCH\u00a0|\u00a0Why the Bank of Canada is raising lending rates so fast:\n\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s behind all the aggressive interest rate hikes?\n13 days ago\nDuration \n4:54\nThe Bank of Canada raised interest rates again, but several indicators \u2014 like inflation \u2013 show it may not have been needed. CBC\u2019s senior business reporter Peter Armstrong explains why it happened and what comes next.\nThe bank justified its decision by saying more tightening was needed to get inflation back to its two per cent target. The inflation rate peaked last June at 8.1 per cent\u00a0and was 3.4 per cent last month.\nWhile it's an encouraging sign to see the official inflation number dip back into the range of between one\u00a0and three\u00a0per cent that the Bank of Canada targets, there's ample reason to think it may be a lot harder to get inflation to go\u00a0lower from here.\nAnalysis\nHas the Bank of Canada conquered inflation? It's complicated\nMinimum wage couldn't land you a 1-bedroom unit years ago. Now, it's even worse. Here's why\nIf gasoline is stripped out of the data, the headline inflation rate would have been four\u00a0per cent. If food is stripped out, the inflation rate would have been 1.7 per cent. If mortgage costs aren't counted, the rate would have been two per cent.\nThose are great examples of why the central bank pays less attention to the headline number \u2014\u00a0because it is easily skewed by individual items that\u00a0can be volatile \u2014 and pays more attention to so-called core inflation, which smooths out the noise. Of the three core inflation measures the bank tabulates, all declined, but one is still above five per cent, while the other two are barely below four per cent.\nRoyce Mendes, an economist with Desjardins, says it's too early to think that the official rate will simply slide back down to target by itself, since the drop in June was based on one-time items that probably can't be repeated.\nRenewing a mortgage this year? Here's what the latest rate hike means for you\nHow does increasing interest rates actually help curb inflation?\n\"The latest moves have been predicated on sharp declines in cellphone services prices, which doesn't provide any assurance that this deceleration can be maintained,\" he said. Mendes said he\u00a0thinks inflation could heat up again in the coming months once the \"one-off\" price drops for things like gasoline and cellular services are gone.\nAndrew Grantham, senior economist with CIBC, says he wouldn't be surprised to see the official inflation rate inch higher in the coming months, once the year-ago comparisons become less favourable.\n\"Headline inflation will likely creep back further above three\u00a0per cent\u00a0in the coming months, as base effects from lower gasoline prices become less generous,\" he said.",

        "content": "For the first time ever, a Canadian province has charged\u00a0a business for providing false information related to carbon offsets, a spokesperson for Alberta's Environment Ministry said, underscoring the sometimes murky activities of companies in a complicated, rapidly growing industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\u00a0\nCarbon offsets are bought and sold under a trading system with\u00a0governments putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions to compel companies\u00a0to fight climate change.\u00a0\nSince 2007, Alberta has run a mandatory carbon offset system for large emitters, such as oil and gas companies, landfills and food processing firms. If they\u00a0produce more than their allotted levels of carbon dioxide, they must purchase credits to offset those\u00a0emissions.\u00a0The credits are generated by companies that reduce emissions by doing things like building wind farms or installing solar panels. To ensure accuracy, the credits are verified by third-party auditors.\u00a0The Alberta litigation centres on the role of one of these third-party verifiers.\nWith Alberta\u00a0and Canada\u00a0betting big on carbon offsets as a tool to tackle global warming, the case spotlights the difficulties in verifying\u00a0whether emission reductions\u00a0are legitimate.\n\"These are the first charges before the courts related to the Emissions Management and Climate Resilience Act,\" Tom McMillan, director of communications for Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, said of Alberta's carbon trading system, which he said is the longest running in North America.\nIn 2020 alone, large emitters in Alberta made $548 million in compliance payments under Alberta's offset rules, McMillan said.\nHe noted that the federal government and other provinces are basing their systems for carbon trading on Alberta's approach,\u00a0meaning the legal action has ramifications far beyond the oil-rich province.\u00a0\nLISTEN | Carbon offsets:\u00a0climate action or 'dangerous distraction'?\u00a0\nWhat On Earth\n27:01\nCarbon offsets: climate action or 'dangerous distraction'?\nCarbon offsets are billed as a necessary tool for climate action. But decades of projects have failed to reduce emissions. With a new Canadian system in the works, we ask what's the problem with offsets and how can we make them work?\nThere doesn't seem to be a lot of fraud or irregularities in Alberta's carbon offset trading system, said Janetta McKenzie, acting director of the oil and gas team at the Pembina Institute, a non-profit\u00a0research group focused on clean energy.\n\"But it's crucial that those systems are producing good data, that we are tracking those offsets, and that they are additional and verifiable,\" she said.\nWith carbon markets being \"very complex\" and\u00a0\"kind of opaque,\"\u00a0having transparent practices for verifying offsets\u00a0is crucial\u00a0to reduce climate change, said\u00a0McKenzie, who broadly supports the strategy.\u00a0\n25 charges filed\u00a0\nAlberta\u00a0Environment and Protected Areas filed 25 charges against Amberg Corp., an environmental services company, and Olga Kiiker for not following environmental legislation, \naccording to a June 23 statement\n.\nThe charges, filed at the Alberta Court of Justice in Calgary,\u00a0include providing false information, providing functions of a third-party assurance provider without the required qualifications\u00a0and breaching other rules related to auditing and verifying carbon offsets, according to \ncourt records\n.\u00a0\nIn 2020, large emitters in Alberta, including oil and gas companies, made $548 million in compliance payments under Alberta's carbon emissions offset trading rules, a government official said. \n \n(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\nThe next court date\u00a0is set for July 19, according to \na statement\n from Alberta's Environment Ministry. None of the charges have been proven in court.\u00a0\nAmberg didn't respond to phone calls seeking comment. The company's website no longer functions and emails to executives bounced back.\u00a0\nThe company provides verification services similar to an auditing firm reviewing a company's financial statements, but for carbon emissions.\u00a0\nPut simply, if a business\u00a0claims it has created 10 tonnes of carbon offsets, for example by building a wind farm or reducing fertilizer use on farms, someone needs to verify whether those offsets are legitimate and can be sold into the broader market.\u00a0\nAs It Happens\nDelta Air Lines faces class-action lawsuit over carbon neutral claim\nCow burps targeted as researchers look at ways to reduce methane emissions\nThose auditors play a crucial role in the carbon offset regulation system to ensure that \"credit generation is accurate,\"\u00a0McMillan said.\nDebates over offset effectiveness\nIf a verification firm is producing fraudulent or inaccurate data on emissions reductions, as the province alleges Amberg has done, then the whole carbon trading system is undermined.\u00a0\nCurrently, the price of a tonne of carbon dioxide in Alberta is $65. That will more than double by 2030 to $170 per tonne, as part of an agreement between the province and federal government.\nSupporters of carbon offsets\u00a0believe companies are more likely to adopt conservation measures or new technologies to reduce their pollution if a\u00a0price is put on emissions.\nWATCH |\n \nEl Ni\u00f1o and climate change could make 2023 hottest year on record:\u00a0\nEl Ni\u00f1o and climate change could make 2023 hottest year on record\n21 days ago\nDuration \n2:06\nThe World Meteorological Organization says El Ni\u00f1o is upon us. The naturally occurring phenomenon is colliding with an already warming planet and could help make 2023 the hottest year on record, meteorologists say.\nCritics say carbon trading allows\u00a0consumers and companies to feel like they're making a difference, but does little to actually address global warming.\nCanadian jurisdictions run several different carbon trading systems, including the mandatory reductions compliance system in Alberta, voluntary carbon offsets \u2014\u00a0such as when an individual purchases carbon credits after taking a long-distance flight\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and a system of carbon trading involving Quebec and California.\u00a0\nOntario's plan to sell 'clean energy' credits doesn't wash with environmental groups\nA federal offset system was launched last year, a spokesperson for Environment and Climate Change Canada said, and\u00a0its\u00a0first offset credits are likely to become available\u00a0in 2024.\nCalls for market oversight\nGraham Gilchrist works on the front lines\u00a0of the\u00a0carbon offset\u00a0trading industry. Based in Leduc, Alta., he's an agronomist, an expert in the science of soil management and crop production, who advises farmers on\u00a0how to reduce\u00a0emissions in order to generate\u00a0carbon credits\u00a0which they can sell.\nFor instance, he works with ranchers\u00a0to switch up what they feed their cows. Different bovine diets\u00a0can lead to fewer cow burps, Gilchrist said, meaning they release\u00a0less climate-changing methane gas over their lifespan.\u00a0\nWATCH |\n \nAlberta college\u00a0help\u00a0farmers get the dirt on greenhouse gases:\n \nAn Alberta college is helping farmers get the dirt on greenhouse gases\n29 days ago\nDuration \n4:55\nAn intensive data project at Olds College is using a unique set up to measure soil gases in fields with different levels of fertilizer with the hopes that farmers can reduce their carbon footprint without reducing crops.\nHis non-profit group, Biological Carbon Canada, has another project that involves adjusting how fertilizer is applied, ensuring more of the nitrogen farmers use on fields ends up directly in the soil, rather than in the atmosphere contributing to climate change.\u00a0\nFarmers who implement these projects\u00a0and have them verified as scientifically sound by an independent third party auditor\u00a0can generate carbon offsets which are then sold to large polluters. Ideally, this puts money back in the pockets of rural residents and reduces\u00a0overall pollution in the process.\u00a0\nSince 2007, Gilchrist estimates farmers in Alberta have received about $180 million for selling emissions credits to middle men, known as aggregators, who then\u00a0sell them to industrial polluters.\nFarmers and ranchers in Alberta can make money by reducing their greenhouse emissions and then collecting carbon offsets to sell through strategies such as changing how they use fertilizer and feeding their cattle differently to reduce how much they burp, says an agronomist who advises the industry. \n \n(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\nThe charges against Amberg, a company responsible for verifying the legitimacy of carbon credits, spotlight a broader problem in Canadian carbon trading systems, Gilchrist said.\u00a0\nThough he doesn't like the idea of more \"red tape\" for farmers, the agronomist does want to see a federal regulator\u00a0responsible for guaranteeing the quality of offsets\u00a0rather than leaving it\u00a0to\u00a0third-party auditors.\nVideo\nHow an Alberta project is helping farmers reduce greenhouse gases and maintain crop yield\nAlberta lays out 'aspiration' to be net-zero by 2050, leaning on still-developing technology\nIdeally, this would mean\u00a0national standardization, so buying a credit for one tonne of carbon anywhere in the country\u00a0would come with a \"made in Canada\" stamp, showing that the emission\u00a0reductions have been properly vetted.\u00a0\nAuthorities in Alberta, normally skittish about federal regulation of the energy sector, seem to back that perspective.\u00a0\n\"As the federal government and other jurisdictions implement regulations and programs that require third party assurance, they will also have to provide [oversight]\u00a0to ensure that those assurances can be relied upon,\" said\u00a0Alberta Environment's\u00a0McMillan.",

        "content": "Canadian households are reeling after what the Bank of Canada calls the fastest series of interest rate hikes in this country's history. The central bank says those hikes will cause pain but are necessary to rein in inflation.\nNot everyone agrees.\n\"I don't think these latest increases were helpful,\" Jim Stanford, economist and director of the non-partisan research institute Centre for Future Work, told CBC News. \"And I don't think they will work.\"\nThe Bank of Canada started boosting\u00a0rates in March\u00a02022. Back then, its key overnight lending rate was at 0.25 per cent. By June of that year, the year-over-year rate of inflation peaked at 8.1 per cent.\nSince then, the consumer price index (CPI) has decelerated sharply and rates have gone up 10 times. The bank's key interest rate now stands at five\u00a0per cent. The last CPI came in at a yearly rate of 3.4 per cent.\nRenewing a mortgage this year? Here's what the latest rate hike means for you\nThe next batch of inflation data will come in next week, and early forecasts show it may fall as low as 3.1 per cent.\nAnd yet the central bank\u00a0says rates must go higher.\n\"We are trying to balance the risks of under- and over-tightening monetary policy,\" Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem\u00a0told a news conference on Wednesday.\n\"If we don't do enough now, we will likely have to do even more later. If we do too much, we risk making economic conditions unnecessarily painful for everybody.\"\n'Broader toolkit' needed to fight inflation\nMany economists have said the bank has already done too much.\nCIBC senior economist\u00a0Andrew Grantham \nsaid in a note on July 3\n that another hike would be \"at best unnecessary, and at worst a mistake.\"\nIf the bank's decision to increase\u00a0rates isn't the best option, what is?\nStanford says the fact is that central banks have a limited range of tools they can use.\nJim Stanford, economist and director of the Centre for Future Work, says instead of leaving the inflation crisis to the Bank of Canada to tackle, the federal government should be doing more.\n \n(Submitted by Jim Stanford)\n\"I think part of our problem is that we said inflation is the Bank of Canada's job and that's it,\" he said. \"Whereas we should be bringing a broader toolkit ... to the problem, including measures the federal government itself should take, rather than saying it's just up to the Bank of Canada.\"\nMonetary policy (interest rate hikes and bond purchases by the Bank of Canada) and fiscal policy (spending and taxation by various levels of government) are supposed to work hand in hand.\nSign up for Peter Armstrong's weekly newsletter here\nAnalysis\nBank of Canada wary of signs of a turning point in economy, as it hikes key interest rate again\nStanford says this\u00a0inflation crisis is different from those\u00a0in the 1970s, '80s and '90s. The current episode was sparked by supply chain disruptions during COVID-19 lockdowns, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and climate issues impacting global agriculture.\nSo policy-makers need to think differently, he says, noting the federal government should do something about the \nsurge in corporate profits\n.\nPeople walk through Toronto\u2019s financial district, home to the country's major banks, corporations and investment firms, in June 2022. Canada has seen a surge in corporate profits.\n \n(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\"We've seen Canadian corporate profits reach their highest level as a share of GDP ever, because in some sectors \u2014 not all, but some sectors \u2014 companies have taken advantage of this inflation to widen the profit margin,\" he said.\nStanford says Australia and some European countries have capped energy prices that soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Many Canadians may bristle at the notion of something like price caps. But he says this country\u00a0already has some price controls on milk and dairy supplies. Why not on other products?\n\"The concept is not as far-fetched as you think \u2014 and international experience is suggesting that might have been a better way to approach the problem, rather than trying to slow down the whole economy with an interest rate hammer,\" he said.\nHigh food and housing costs\nArmine Yalnizyan, an economist and Atkinson Fellow on the Future of Workers, says there are loads of small things that governments in Canada can do to help alleviate the pressures of the cost-of-living crisis without adding to inflation.\nShe says many households have struggled to keep up with the cost of food.\n\"In Canada, we are the only country in the advanced economic world to not have a school food program that is national,\" she told the CBC podcast \nFront Burner\n.\nLISTEN | Bank of Canada continues to increase interest rates to fight inflation: \n23:46\nHas the Bank of Canada gone too far?\nYalnizyan says there are different food programs from province to province, but there is no single national program to help ensure that\u00a0no child\u00a0goes hungry.\n\"We've been expecting to see something happen since food prices took off, and so far, crickets. So that's definitely something that could be done immediately,\" she said.\nHousing is also\u00a0key.\nMike Moffatt, an economist and senior director at the University of Ottawa's Smart Prosperity Institute, says there are a series of actions governments could take to help address housing affordability, including\u00a0some immediate and simple ways to incentivize developers to build the right stock.\nReal estate signs are shown in Mississauga, Ont., in May. Governments could take a number of actions to help address housing affordability in Canada, one economist says, including waiving the HST on purpose-built rentals and relaxing stringent zoning laws.\n \n(Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press)\nGovernments could waive the HST on purpose-built rentals, and cities could relax stringent zoning laws, Moffatt says.\nAnother solution to the housing crisis comes via immigration, he says: \"How many electricians and plumbers are we going to bring in versus how many university professors?\"\nMoffatt, who is an assistant professor in business, economics and public policy\u00a0at Western University's Ivey Business School in London, Ont., says his father was a sheet metal worker.\n\"For the last 40 years, our immigration system is biased towards bringing in guys like me, and biased against bringing in guys like my dad. And we absolutely need to flip that,\" he said.\nPoilievre blames Trudeau after Bank of Canada hikes interest rate again\nAnalysis\nHas the Bank of Canada conquered inflation? It's complicated\nIf Canada wants to build enough housing stock, it needs to make sure it has the skilled labour to do that.\nMoffatt says small changes on the margin can add up quickly to help in the fight against inflation. While he agrees that monetary and fiscal policy should work together, he says that's not always as easy as it sounds.\n\"It's always easier at the bottom of the business cycle,\" he said.\nMost people are familiar with that playbook. When the economy is in the ditch, central banks cut rates and governments boost spending. That creates demand and gets money flowing.\nWATCH | Explaining ongoing interest rate hikes:\n \n\"The challenge is doing that in reverse,\" Moffatt said, \"where you're basically asking the federal government to take money out of the economy.\"\nAsk any economist and they can rhyme off a laundry list of actions that federal, provincial and municipal governments could take to relieve some of the pressure.\n\"But we're doing nothing,\" Yalnizyan said. \"It's like that \nSimpsons\n episode, where the character says, 'We've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas.'\"",

Using\u00a0provincial and federal data from 2022, they found the\u00a0rental wage for a one-bedroom unit\u00a0is higher than the minimum wage in most\u00a0major cities across the country.\u00a0\nUsing the\u00a0rental calculation, the report also found that\u00a0minimum wage workers could only afford one-bedroom units in three cities, all in Quebec.\u00a0And even there, where rents are comparatively more affordable than in other parts of the country, researchers say the trend is\u00a0\"worrisome\" as workers still need to earn more than minimum wage to be able to rent\u00a0an affordable unit.\nPoliticians point fingers on housing crisis, but calls growing for more co-operation\nAs rents soar, tenants organize local protests. But what's needed for a national housing movement?\nMeanwhile, in Toronto and Vancouver, the report\u00a0suggests that\u00a0even two full-time minimum wage workers can't afford a one-bedroom unit without spending more than 30 per cent of their income, let alone a two-bedroom unit.\u00a0In B.C., the rental wage for a two-bedroom unit is more than\u00a0twice as much as the minimum wage, with Ontario's\u00a0just under double the minimum wage.\u00a0\nThe report did not\u00a0look\u00a0extensively at\u00a0those on social assistance and disability supports, but\u00a0those subsidies were found\u00a0to be even less than provincial\u00a0minimum wages. Tranjan says if they had taken a closer look, the results would have been even more bleak.\u00a0\n\"We don't have enough social housing in the country for all the folks who are presently receiving social assistance, and a large and increasing share of social assistance recipients rely on the private rental market for housing,\" he said.\n\"They're competing with minimum wage workers and with everyone else.\"\nWATCH | Average price in Canada up by 10 per cent since last year:\n\u00a0\nAverage rent has risen by 10 per cent in a year\n2 months ago\nDuration \n2:04\nThe average price for a rental home in Canada is up by 10 per cent since last year, and even cities known for lower rents, such as Montreal, are feeling the pinch.\nRaising\u00a0wages\u00a0\nHistorically, minimum wages were set by governments to\u00a0protect\u00a0non-unionized workers, reduce\u00a0the number of low-paying jobs and\u00a0alleviate poverty, among a host of other potential benefits, \naccording to the federal government\n.\u00a0\nBut today, an important part of what determines wages is the market, said Roslyn\u00a0Kunin, the president of an economic consulting firm in Vancouver, B.C.

Depends where they live\n\"There has to be someone willing to work at that\u00a0wage\u00a0and there has to be someone who can afford to pay that wage for that kind of work,\" said Kunin.\nTranjan and Macdonald, cross-referencing federal and provincial data from 2021, estimate about 828,000 people across the country were earning a\u00a0minimum wage salary or less. Meanwhile, about\u00a01.1 million Canadians belonged to households where two or more\u00a0people earned\u00a0the equivalent of two full-time minimum wage jobs or less.\nAccording to Kunin, raising wages to match rental rates\u00a0would not only cause the cost of common goods to increase, but it would likely lead to the disappearance of many jobs and businesses altogether.\n\"All of us would suffer from the loss of available goods and services.\"\u00a0\nShort and long-term solutions\n\"For individuals, the best thing to do is to get as much education, experience, training as possible so you can work for a wage that's higher,\" said Kunin, adding that\u00a0obtaining additional education is \"easier than it has been\" due to the rise of online learning.\nBut\u00a0Brenda Spotton Visano, a public policy and economics professor at York University in Toronto, says these workers are often stuck in a \"catch-22\" situation, since many don't have the time or money\u00a0to upgrade their skills that might be required\u00a0for higher-paying jobs.\nMore B.C. renters are spending 'crisis-level' amounts on housing, rental housing index finds\nThis single dad makes $75K a year.

Many say it's the busiest the island has been since the late 1990s. The CBC's Matthew Moore reports.\nSaillant said that labour was \"a major constraint on New Brunswick's ability to expand housing supply.\"\nLast year, the\u00a0Construction Association of Prince Edward Island\u00a0said it believed\u00a0\nat least 1,000 more workers were needed\n.

Anderson denied involvement in Shakur's killing, and died two years later in a shooting in Compton, Calif.\nPolice reported collecting multiple computers, a cellphone and hard drive, \"documentary documents,\" a Vibe magazine that featured Shakur, \"purported marijuana,\" several .40-calibre bullets, two \"tubs containing photographs\" and a copy of Davis' 2019 tell-all memoir, \nCompton Street Legend\n.\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed it served a search warrant Monday in the neighbouring city of Henderson.\nThe department hasn't said whether investigators expect to make a first-ever arrest in the 1996 slaying of Shakur.\nNeighbourhood residents\u00a0said they saw officers detain two people outside the home Monday night while investigators searched the one-storey property.\nShakur is seen at the MTV Music Video Awards in New York in this Sept. 4, 1996 file photo.\n \n(Reuters)\nCase before grand jury\nThe case is being presented to a grand jury in Las Vegas, according to a person with direct knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to speak publicly. The timing and results of those proceedings was unclear, and the person did not identify the two people whom police encountered at the house.\nIt was not immediately known if Davis has a lawyer who can comment on his behalf. Messages left for Davis and his wife, Paula Clemons, weren't returned.\u00a0\nNews of the search breathed new life into Shakur's long-unsolved killing, which has been surrounded by conspiracy theories. Attention on the case has endured for decades.\n\"I'm one of the only living eyewitnesses to Tupac's killing, who also knows the much larger story around the reasons why both Tupac and Biggie were killed,\" Davis wrote in the memoir, referring also to the 1997 killing of rapper \"Biggie Smalls,\" also known as \"Notorious B.I.G.\"\nDeadly ambush\nOn the night of Sept. 7, 1996, Shakur was riding in a black BMW driven by Death Row Records founder Marion \"Suge\" Knight in a convoy of about 10 cars. They were waiting at a red light a block from the Las Vegas Strip when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted. Shakur was shot multiple times and died days later.\nKnight was wounded but recovered. He was \nsentenced in October 2018 to 28 years in prison\n for running over a man with his pickup truck several years earlier.\nNo longer a cold case? Police confirm search warrant in Tupac Shakur's 1996 killing\nDead celebrities are being digitally resurrected \u2014 and the ethics are murky\nThe Shakur shooting unfolded shortly after a casino brawl earlier in the evening involving Anderson, Shakur and their associates.\nThere were many witnesses, but the investigation stalled because people refused to cooperate, Las Vegas police said previously.\nThat silence broke, to a point, in 2018, when Davis\u00a0admitted to being in the front seat of the Cadillac. In an interview for a BET show, he implicated his nephew in the shooting, saying Anderson was one of two people in the backseat.\nDavis said the shots were fired from the back of the car, though he stopped short of naming the shooter.\nBut in his memoir, Davis said he shared what he knew nearly a decade earlier in a closed-door meeting with federal and local authorities who were investigating the possibility that Shakur's slaying was linked to B.I.G.'s death.",

        "summary": "Advocates say rent contol helps offer tenants predictability and prevents excessive price hikes from year to year. But others say it can restrain new housing development in a market that\u2019s already desperately short on units.",
        "content": "With the cost of rental housing hitting all-time highs, many current and would-be tenants alike have something on their mind: rent control.\nThe average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in a purpose-built building was $1,258 per month in 2022 \u2014 much more in Toronto and Vancouver \u2014\u00a0according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).\u00a0\nThose rates are an increase of\u00a05.6 per cent over the previous year, says CMHC \u2014\u00a0well above the 2021 average of just three per cent.\u00a0\nA lot of tenants who are \"truly struggling with rising rents\" are pushing for more regulation,\u00a0said Bahar Shadpour, director of policy and communications at the Canadian Centre for Housing Rights (CCHR), a tenants advocacy organization.\nBut rent control works differently in various parts of the country, and there are\u00a0mixed opinions about whether it's the answer.\u00a0\nLISTEN | The pros and cons of rent control:\nCost of Living\n7:03\nWhy aren't there rent control rules across Canada?\nWhat regions have rent control?\nFive provinces and one territory offer some form of rental regulation: British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island and, \nrecently, Yukon\n.\nNova Scotia has a temporary rent control policy, brought in during the pandemic, which \nexpires at the end of 2025\n.\nHow does it work?\nIn all provinces and territories, rents can typically only be raised on a leased unit once every 12 months, and landlords must give between one and three months' notice, depending on the length of the lease.\u00a0\nBut with rent control, governments set a maximum increase each year. In Ontario, \nfor 2024, it's\u00a02.5 per cent\n.\nBut in most places, those maximums only apply to tenants currently renting a unit. Generally, landlords can increase rents between leases as high as the market can bear.\nThat's where vacancy control comes into play. P.E.I., for example, regulates\u00a0rental rates between tenants. The rents are attached to the unit, not the renter, according to the CCHR.\nA 'For Rent' sign in Toronto in July 2022. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in a purpose-built building was $1,258 per month in 2022 \u2014 much more in the Ontario capital and in Vancouver \u2014 according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  \n \n(Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)\nManitoba also offers vacancy control, but only in buildings with four or more units.\nIn Quebec, landlords must notify new tenants of the lowest rent in the preceding 12 months when signing a new lease.\nFor ongoing tenants in Quebec, rent control applies if the\u00a0tenant refuses an increase within one month of receiving notice\n\u00a0\nand requests a review by the housing tribunal.\n\u00a0\nThe tribunal can then determine the increase, according to an annual calculation\u00a0that the tenant and landlord must agree to.\u00a0\nAre there exceptions?\nYes.\u00a0Landlords can apply for increases beyond the mandated limits\u00a0to cover changes such as repairs or upgrades to a unit.\u00a0\nThey can also evict tenants\u00a0if the property requires significant repairs or refurbishment \u2014 known as a \"renoviction\" \u2014 or if a family member needs to move in.\u00a0\nThere are good reasons exemptions like these exist, but they\u00a0can be abused to sneak in a rent increase, says\u00a0Mike Moffatt, an economist and assistant professor at Ivey Business School in London, Ont.\nExperts agree that constructing new purpose-built rental buildings will help alleviate pressure on the market. But some say rent controls discourage developers from building new projects.\n \n(Stephen MacGillivray/The Canadian Press)\n\"What [the landlord] might be able to do is say, 'Oh well, my son's going to go to school, and he needs that unit for a year.' So you sort of give it to a family member for a year, then the son leaves and then you can charge market rent again,\"\u00a0he told CBC Radio's \nCost of Living\n.\nThere can also be other exemptions. For example, buildings in Manitoba first occupied after March 7, 2005, are \nexempt from rent control for 20 years\n, as are units over $1,570 per month.\nDoes rent control help tenants?\nOpinions differ.\u00a0\nMoffatt says while regulation can prevent landlords from \"taking advantage of market conditions,\" rent control typically only benefits existing tenants. It can lead to higher rents for new tenants.\n\"Oftentimes, those rents go up [when] the existing tenants leave,\" he said. \"So it tends to advantage one group over another.\"\nShadpour says one solution is to expand\u00a0vacancy control \u2014 to \"disincentivize that form of rent gouging.\"\nWATCH | How high rents are impacting students:\nRent for student housing is out of control. Is there a fix?\n1 month ago\nDuration \n5:59\nStudents are being faced with higher rents and a shortage of supply and some experts say post-secondary institutions need to co-ordinate enrolment levels with the availability of housing.\nDoes it affect construction?\u00a0\nOthers say rent control discourages developers from constructing purpose-built rental buildings.\n\"In Ontario in the 1950s and 1960s and early 1970s, there was a huge boom in construction of purpose-built rental apartment buildings,\" said Tony Irwin, president and CEO of the Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario (FRPO).\n\"When rent control was introduced \u2014 coupled with some other tax incentives, federal tax incentives, that I believe were removed \u2014 you then saw purpose-built rental construction go off a cliff.\"\nA February 2023 report put out by four groups, including the FRPO,\u00a0\nbacks that up\n. It shows between 1960 and 1979, nearly 224,000 rental units were constructed in Ontario. That compares to fewer than 24,000 between 2000 and 2023.\u00a0\n\"Most developers and builders have a choice \u2014 that they can build something as a purpose-built rental or they could build something as a condo,\" Moffatt said.\u00a0\nIf there are too many restrictions on the former, \"developers and builders will say, 'Oh, to heck with it. I would rather just sell these as condo units,'\" he said.\u00a0\nBahar Shadpour, director of communications at the Canadian Centre for Housing Rights, says that a wider range of housing types are needed \u2014 not just 'luxury' rentals.\n \n(Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press)\nThough rent control alone doesn't influence development, Shadpour\u00a0pushed back against the argument\u00a0it limits development given historical trends. Ontario removed\u00a0rent control on buildings built after Nov. 1, 1991, an exception\u00a0that stayed in place until\u00a02017,\u00a0hoping that would encourage developers to build rental housing, she says.\u00a0\n\"And what we see across the board is that that didn't happen \u2014 developers still created condominiums and single-family homes.\"\nWhat else can help?\nThe experts CBC\u00a0News spoke with all agree that increasing the rental housing stock is critical.\u00a0\n\"We've been under-building for decades,\" said Irwin. \"There's such a huge shortage of housing generally, and rental housing specifically, that is putting a huge pressure on rents.\n\"It is a supply and demand conversation.\"\nProviding incentives, such as tax breaks, to developers will help spur new construction, Moffatt and Shadpour say.\u00a0\nAs rents soar, tenants organize local protests. But what's needed for a national housing movement?\nMinimum wage couldn't land you a 1-bedroom unit years ago. Now, it's even worse. Here's why\nCBC Explains\nWhat are rent strikes \u2014 and do they work?\nMeanwhile, municipalities need to streamline approvals so builders can get construction done in a timely fashion, Irwin says.\nAnd, as housing prices show no sign of slowing down, Shadpour says developers need to prioritize more accessible options.\n\"We can't have any more luxury purpose-built rentals. People can't afford it.\"\u00a0",

CBC\u2019s Jamie Strashin explores how single-game betting has changed the game for some fans and why addiction experts are worried.\nYet Czegledy said the gap between the activity in casino games and sports-related products in Ontario has been in line with what the industry expected, despite the media focus on the\u00a0betting side.\n\"The differences in segment performance have followed expected form,\" Czegledy\u00a0said.\nThe newly released\u00a0iGO data also provides a breakdown of the gaming segments over the first year of the regulated market.\nAt nearly 9 minutes of sports betting ads per Toronto Maple Leafs game, a new group wants them banned\nFrom April 4, 2022, through\u00a0the end of March 2023, iGO\u00a0said the regulated market saw $35.6 billion in total wagers.\nNearly $28 billion of that was spent on casino games and peer-to-peer bingo.\u00a0That was roughly four times higher than the $7 billion spent on betting, which included sports and esports wagers. Peer-to-peer poker wagers totalled $992 million for the year.\nThese combined gambling activities generated $1.4 billion in gaming revenues, the iGO reported, with $940 million of that coming from the casino segment and $433 million from betting.

        "summary": "Unlike mainstream social media, the fediverse is a federated social network that is made up of thousands of servers that connect and can talk to each other. Now Threads wants to join.",
        "content": "If you recently downloaded Meta's new Threads app \u2014 a social media platform some say rivals Twitter \u2014 you may have noticed it plans to join the fediverse.\nBefore you can join Threads, a disclaimer pops up: \"Future versions of Threads will work within the fediverse, a new type of social media network that allows people to follow and interact with each other on different platforms.\"\nWhat exactly does that mean?\nImagine posting a tweet on Facebook or liking an Instagram reel on TikTok.\nThe fediverse \u2014 a combination of the words federation and universe \u2014 is a loose collective of decentralized servers that operate using open source standards. Unlike traditional social networks, the fediverse allows users to connect and communicate with others seamlessly across multiple platforms.\nThreads, a new social platform by Meta, signed up more than 100 million users in its first five days.\n \n(Ashley Fraser/CBC)\nProponents\u00a0say it's similar to the early days of the internet, when Big Tech hadn't yet created social media sites that rely on advertising and use algorithms to keep you scrolling on their platforms.\n\"You can have an account on one service and you can post on other services,\" said Evan Prodromou, an entrepreneur and technologist based in Montreal. \"Other people can read your stuff; they can connect to you. You can have relationships and friendships \u2014 family relationships that don't depend on which actual service you're using. So, that's the fediverse promise.\"\nThink of it like email. There are many different email domains available, from Gmail to Outlook. Even if you use a different service than your friend, you can still communicate with one another.\n\"We're using social networking for what it was originally meant for, which is giving us better social relationships,\" said Prodromou. \"So, it's not about the platforms, it's about the people.\"\nHow did the fediverse start?\u00a0\nProdromou is often credited as a pioneer of the fediverse, although he points out it's based on patterns and structures that go back to the very beginning of the internet.\nIn 2008, he created a website called identi.ca, which was a distributed social network similar to Twitter.\u00a0At the time, blogs were popular and people would use software\u00a0such as feed aggregators to bring them together in one place.\n\"My kind of incentive in building identi.ca and the original federated social networks was to take that experience and bring it into that social network interface,\" said Prodromou.\nWhat made identi.ca different was the development of a standard that let people download the software, install it on their own servers and then communicate directly with their users, as if they were on the same server.\u00a0\nAnother breakthrough was the release of\u00a0Mastodon in 2017 by German developer Eugen Rochko.\nEvan Prodromou, who lives in Montreal, helped create ActivityPub, a decentralized social networking protocol that much of the fediverse is developed on. \n \n(Amita June Prodromou)\nSimilar to Twitter, Mastodon is a micro-blogging platform and one of the larger self-hosted social networking spaces on the fediverse. Small groups or individuals run independent communities or \"instances\" on their own servers, and they have their own terms of service and moderation rules.\u00a0\nIn 2018, the organization that set standards for the World Wide Web, known as the W3C, wanted to have a modern standard for distributed social networks such as Mastodon.\nThey started a group \u2014 co-chaired by Prodromou \u2014 called the Social Web Working Group.\u00a0\nProdromou worked with four others, including Christine Lemmer-Webber, Jessica Tallon, Erin Shepherd, and Amy Guy, to develop the standards that make up the ActivityPub protocol.\nIt's an open, decentralized social networking protocol that much of the fediverse is now developed on, including Mastodon and other services, such as Pixelfed, a photo-sharing platform similar to Instagram.\nWhy are people moving to the fediverse?\nWhen scrolling on Facebook, TikTok or other mainstream social platforms, you might notice content from accounts you don't follow. Those platforms\u00a0use an algorithm to show you content based on data they've gathered on you, including what you've previously engaged with.\nThe fediverse doesn't rely on algorithms or data scraping in the same way. Mastodon, for example, will show you the content of people and instances you follow in chronological order.\nThis creates a less stressful environment, Prodromou says, because your feed isn't designed to keep you on\u00a0the platform.\nThe servers that make up the fediverse cost money to run, but revenue from advertisements aren't the primary way of\u00a0maintaining them. Individuals and groups have their own methods, including subscription fees or donations.\nAre you on Threads yet? Here's what you're giving away\nMeta's Threads now fastest-growing platform after 100 million users sign up in first five days\n\"There's no one entity who can say: 'Everybody has to read our ads, and everyone has to give us their data,' because we've got that distributed set of control. So it gives us more control over what we do,\" said Prodromou.\nThe fediverse is customizable, and users can follow or create their own instances that appeal to their interests and values, explained Brian Keegan, a computational social scientist with the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\"By joining different kinds of instances or moving your account between different kinds of instances, you're able to really vote or elect if this is the model of content, moderation and governance that I want to have around my social media.\"\u00a0\nThis creates an environment where users have more control of what they want to see and are less likely to be exposed to content like misinformation and hate speech seen on other platforms, Keegan said.\nMastodon, also seen as a competitor to Twitter, allows users to post updates and see what others are posting in their feed, much like other micro-blogging social platforms.\n \n(CBC )\nWith that control, however, the federated model can allow for people to fall into echo chambers, he said. \"There are probably some necessary social changes that we'll need to make on the fediverse in order to improve that.\"\nKeegan points out that if you do have a problem with something you're seeing, content moderation decisions are made by whoever is running the server that you're on. So you may have more success flagging a concern there compared to trying to appeal to an administrator working under the umbrella of a big tech company.\u00a0\nIs Meta welcome?\nBoth Prodromou and Keegan see Meta's potential move to the fediverse as an opportunity to grow and expand the space.\nIn addition to potentially making the interface less clunky and more user friendly, Keegan said a larger platform would bring more users to interact with.\n\"By having an organization like Meta express an interest, and building and scaling infrastructure and experiences and apps, that might allow for more people to join the fediverse,\" said Keegan.\u00a0\nCurrently, the fediverse has around 12 million users. By comparison, more than 100 million users signed up for Meta's Threads \nin the first five days of its launch\n.\nUnlike Meta and Twitter, led by Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk respectively, networks on the fediverse aren't typically run by a company or led by a CEO.\n \n(Manu Fernandez/The Associated Press)\nBut some fediverse users are set against a major tech company joining.\nKeegan said there's a movement of Mastodon users who have started an \"anti-Meta Fedi pact,\" pledging to block any instances owned by Meta.\n\"I think people see Meta coming in\u00a0and potentially this risk of them bringing this really poor track record, and destroying or deteriorating this really interesting and exciting space that's really been built from the bottom up by a lot of diverse, different kinds of communities,\" said Keegan.\nMeta hasn't said when Threads will join the fediverse and hasn't released details about what its presence will look like, beyond using the ActivityPub protocol so it can talk to other servers.",

Founded by Marc Soberano in 2014, the contracting non-profit is primarily driven by social causes, and uses the homes it's tasked to retrofit as a training ground for its apprentices \u2014 with a focus on green building.\n\"Where most people train and employ people to run their business, we run our business to train and employ people,\" Soberano said.\nIt's one example of some of the work social contractors are doing all across Canada \u2014\u00a0 \"multi-solving\" in the face of an affordable housing crisis, a labour shortage in the construction industry and climate change.\nBuilding clean jobs in a labour shortage\nTargeted to those who often face barriers to employment, such as racialized people, women, those coming out of incarceration, or newcomers, like Khainza, Building Up's 16-week paid training program offers participants an opportunity to become skilled in green retrofitting to eventually gain long-term employment.\nThat includes a focus on trades like carpentry and drywalling, water retrofits, enhancing a building's insulation and more.\n\"There's a labour shortage all around the construction sector today,\" Soberano said. \"But\u00a0as the construction sector continues to evolve, that shortage is going to be more extreme when it comes to green building and energy efficiency. So this home is a great way to help kind of train the next generation of tradespeople with those skills.\"\nBy training apprentices in the green practices of trades, like carpentry, water retrofits, enhancing a building's insulation and more, Building Up participants walk away with a knowledge base aimed at helping to meet a massive need for skilled construction workers.\n \n(Alex Lupul/CBC)\nOver the next decade, Ontario's government wants to build 1.5 million homes \nbut said it will need 100,000 more workers to do so\n. The construction industry employs around \n600,000 workers\n in the province, but with the\u00a0sector's\u00a0\njob vacancy rate\n at 4.6 per cent, there are still hundreds of skilled construction jobs, with no one to fill them.\nThat's just looking at construction as a whole. A 2022 report by Canada Green Building Council and the Delphi Group forecasts that \nthe country will see a shortage of workers\n skilled in green construction over the next few decades, as the demand for clean jobs increases.\u00a0\n\"The challenges that we face as a society are also opportunities,\" Soberano said.\nDemand for biofuels sparks Canadian boom. But will U.S. subsidies pull investment south?\nOften, Building Up will take trainees from the very neighbourhoods it's working in, so locals are improving their own communities.\nThe home Khainza is working on is Building Up's 12th project with the Parkdale Neighbourhood Land Trust, a not-for-profit which owns and preserves affordable units to be rented out to low-income households from within the community.\u00a0\nAn old, leaky, inefficient house presents the opportunity to offer hands-on experiential learning for apprentices new to construction, Soberano said. And that house, once retrofitted, will be a more sustainable addition to Toronto's affordable housing market.\nMarc Soberano is the founder and executive director of Building Up.\n \n(Alex Lupul/CBC)\nOver the past five years, Building Up has made energy-efficiency improvements to more than 30,000 Toronto Community Housing units, on top of other renovations in residential buildings across the city.\nThe average wait for an affordable, subsidized one-bedroom\n \nunit in Toronto is 14 years\n, as of 2022. By partnering with other social organizations like the Parkdale Neighbourhood Land Trust and the YWCA, Building Up says it can restore units that might otherwise be unlivable or made unaffordable due to energy inefficiency.\nMany of Canada's greenest apartments are ultra-affordable. Here's why\nThis home will soon house a tenant from the city's centralized wait-list \u2014 someone with low to moderate income, and likely a single woman or gender-diverse individual and their household.\nAs for the potential savings, Susan Aharan, facility manager for the YWCA, said she's seen energy consumption lowered approximately 30 per cent in other YWCA units previously retrofitted by Building Up.\u00a0\nSome customers have cut utility expenses by an average of more than $150 per year following water\u00a0retrofits that involve swapping toilets, shower heads and aerators to maximize efficiency, according to Building Up.\u00a0\nEco-retrofitting to net-zero\u00a0\nIn 2021, buildings in Canada \nrepresented nearly one-fifth\n \nof the country's total greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 \nhigher than emissions\n from agriculture or heavy industry. Those emissions come from burning gas for heating or generating electricity for use within buildings. In Toronto, buildings account for approximately \n55 per cent of the city's total GHGs\n.\n\"It's really useful to keep in mind that [approximately] two-thirds of the buildings standing today \u2026 will still be standing in 2050,\" said Maya Papineau, an associate professor at Carleton University who studies environmental and energy economics.\nThe exterior of a home being retrofitted by Building Up in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood.\n \n(Alex Lupul/CBC)\n\"To meet our 2050 targets, that means that we're going to have to massively reduce the average CO2 that each dwelling and building produces. And that basically entails a very large retrofit project on a national scale,\" she said. \"It has implications for needing an adequately trained workforce.\"\nPapineau's \nresearch suggests\n the government of Canada's predictions for how much retrofitting is going to save are actually overestimated. One driver of that disparity between modelled predictions and actual savings, she said, is poor quality of installation.\n\"So if you have somebody who hasn't been trained adequately in these new types of retrofits \u2026 that's going to cause a shortfall,\" Papineau said. \"I think the goal to retrofit homes and to make homes green and shift to electrification has to go hand-in-hand with having a workforce that is trained to be able to conduct these retrofits in a quality way.\"\nWhat on Earth?\nSmall backyard homes could offer both housing and climate relief\nBuilding up on a national scale\nScaling up a program like Building Up isn't without challenges.\u00a0\nFor one, because the program is rooted in local communities, it may require federal funding to bolster it and other similar initiatives, said Laura Tozer, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto who studies the transition to renewable energy.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act might provide a model, said Tozer, because it has clean jobs built directly into its plan for reducing carbon emissions. Connecting apprenticeship programs to energy incentives, the Act has already created \nmore than 142,000 clean jobs\n across the U.S. since it was signed into law in August 2022.\u00a0\nBut Canada currently doesn't have comparable legislation.\nOver the next decade, Ontario's government wants to build 1.5 million homes but said it will need 100,000 more workers to do so.\n \n(Patrick Morrell/CBC)\nThough there are other organizations like Building Up across Canada \u2014 Purpose Construction and Build Inc. in Manitoba, Newo in Alberta, and Impact Construction in Newfoundland, to name a few \u2014 the social contractor approach isn't nearly as widespread as general contractors.\u00a0\nAnd though many construction firms have started to move\u00a0toward green construction, Tozer and Papineau both said there's still a large need for green retrofitting and skilled workers to help meet Canada's net-zero targets.\n\"There are massive opportunities for [apprentices] coming out of the program to have not just a job, but a real career,\" Soberano said.\nLaura Tozer is an assistant professor at the University of Toronto who studies the transition to renewable energy. \n \n(Lauren Pelley/CBC)\nBack at the demolished Toronto home, with about three weeks left of her training, Khainza said she already intends to take her newly acquired skills and pay them forward. In a few years, she hopes to run her own construction firm and employ other new immigrants to perform green retrofits.\n\"When I was back in Uganda, you could see the dry seasons were [getting] hotter than the ones before,\" Khainza said. \"I'm scared of what is going to happen if we don't do anything about this planet.\"\n\"I know that in time [green construction skills are] going to be the new norm, and I would like my team to have that kind of knowledge. And if they don't have it, because I have it, I will definitely teach them.\"",

He excites me when I watch him. He moves me. He's the singer who gets across what the composer has in mind, and probably a little more.\"\nHe not only survived the rise of rock music but endured so long and so well that he gained new fans and collaborators, some young enough to be his grandchildren.\nWATCH l 'You have to believe in the song,' Bennett tells\u00a0CBC: \nHow singer Tony Bennett became Tony Bennett\n45 years ago\nDuration \n17:42\nThe man Frank Sinatra called \"the best singer in the business\" talks about his career with the CBC's Peter Gzowski in 1977.\nIn 2014, at age 88, Bennett broke his own record as the oldest living performer with a No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart for \nCheek to Cheek\n, his duets project with Lady Gaga. Three years earlier, he topped the charts with \nDuets II\n, featuring such contemporary stars as Gaga, Carrie Underwood and Winehouse, in her last studio recording.\nFor Bennett, one of the few performers to move easily between pop and jazz, such collaborations were part of his crusade to expose new audiences to what he called the Great American Songbook.\n\"No country has given the world such great music,\" Bennett said in a 2015 interview with Downbeat Magazine. \"Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern. Those songs will never die.\"\nCanadian collaborators\nIn 2018, he embarked on the \nLove Is Here To Stay\n album with Krall of Nanaimo, B.C.\nYears earlier, Bennett and lang played a series of tour dates in support of their 2002 album, \nA Wonderful World\n.\nBennett and Diana Krall are shown at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on Feb. 10, 2019.\n \n(Rich Fury/Getty Images for The Recording Academy)\nWhile a quintessential American performer, he spoke glowingly of his long relationship with Canadian audiences while speaking to CBC's \nThe Hour\n in 2012.\n\"Since 1960, I've played from Vancouver to Montreal, every city in Canada, through the years. You get to love the people who treat you well and you love them right back.\"\nBennett had periods of struggle, suffering a near-fatal cocaine overdose in the late 1970s. He lamented not being able to help Winehouse, whose\u00a0drug-related death occurred just a few weeks before they were slated to play a London concert in 2011.\n\"I was gonna tell her to slow down because I had a drug problem when I was younger and I stopped doing it and it changed my life for the better,\" he told\n The Hour\n.\nClaimed by New York City, San Francisco\nLong associated with San Francisco, Bennett would note that his true home was Astoria, the working-class community in the New York City borough of Queens, where he grew up during the Great Depression. The singer chose his old neighbourhood as the site for the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, that he and his third wife, Susan Crow Benedetto, a former teacher, helped found in 2001.\nThe school is not far from the birthplace of the man who was once Anthony Dominick Benedetto. His father was an Italian immigrant who inspired his love of singing, but he died when Anthony was 10. Bennett credited his mother, Anna, with teaching him a valuable lesson as he watched her working at home, supporting her three children as a seamstress doing piecework after his father died.\nBennett celebrates with the crowd after his statue was unveiled outside the Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill in San Francisco on Aug. 19, 2016.\n \n(Eric Risberg/The Associated Press)\n\"We were very impoverished,\" Bennett said in a 2016 AP interview. \"I saw her working and every once in a while she'd take a dress and throw it over her shoulder and she'd say, 'Don't have me work on a bad dress. I'll only work on good dresses.\"'\nHe studied commercial art in high school, but had to drop out to help support his family. The teenager got a job as a copy boy for the Associated Press, performed as a singing waiter and competed in amateur shows.\nA combat infantryman during the Second World War, he served as a librarian for the Armed Forces Network after the war and sang with an army big band in occupied Germany. His earliest recording is a 1946 air check from Armed Forces Radio of the blues song\u00a0\nSt. James Infirmary\n.\nChampioned civil rights\nIn 1950, Mitch Miller, the head of Columbia Records' pop singles division, signed Bennett and released the single, \nThe Boulevard of Broken Dreams\n, a semi-hit. Bennett was on the verge of being dropped from the label in 1951 when he had his first No. 1 on the pop charts with\n Because of You\n. More hits followed, including \nRags to Riches\n and \nBlue Velvet\n.\nReleased in 1962 as the B-side of of another song,\n I Left My Heart in San Francisco\n, the reflective ballad became a grassroots phenomenon staying on the charts for more than two years and earning Bennett his first two Grammys, including record of the year.\nBennett holds up his portrait of Louis Armstrong beside the legendary jazz artist, in London on Oct. 29, 1970. Bennett took up painting at a young age and continued the pursuit when not singing.\n \n(Jack Kay/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\nBennett's friendship with Black musicians and his disgust at the racial prejudice he encountered in the Army led him to become an active supporter of the civil rights movement. He answered Harry Belafonte's call to join Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march and perform for the protesters.\nHarry Belafonte, legendary performer and activist, dead at 96\nBy his early 40s, he was seemingly out of fashion musically, though he continued releasing albums into the 1970s.

        "summary": "In Greta Gerwig's newly released Barbie movie, the beloved doll carries more weight in the cultural consciousness than she can bear on her famously disproportionate frame.",
        "content": "The Barbie doll carries more weight\u00a0in the cultural consciousness than she can bear on her famously disproportionate frame.\nShe's at once a symbol of feminine aspiration, the careerist everywoman who in 1962 owned a home before most real women could have credit cards \u2014 and she is also, as a teenage character in the newly released \nBarbie \nmovie puts it, \"a professional bimbo,\" \"a symbol of sexualized capitalism,\" \"a glorification of rampant consumerism,\" and \"a fascist.\" Welp!\nAs narrator Helen Mirren tells us during the film's opening scene, which playfully mirrors that of \n2001: A Space Odyssey\n, girls have always had dolls. But when they spot a towering Barbie (here subbing the iconic monolith from the classic Kubrick film), the primitive toddlers around her smash their boring, parenthood-simulating baby dolls. Barbie is invented; a new dawn has arrived.\nThat duality-of-woman premise was perfect fodder for \nBarbie \ndirector and co-writer Greta Gerwig, who typically explores the liminal space that women occupy between adolescence and adulthood (\nLady Bird\n, \nLittle Women\n) or young adulthood and the real thing (\nFrances Ha\n and \nMistress America\n, in which she starred and co-wrote with her partner, the filmmaker Noah Baumbach).\u00a0\nIn Gerwig's hands, Barbie (Margot Robbie) is a vision of feminine ideals \u2014 with effortless beauty and brains \u2014 until her flawless lifestyle in Barbieland is disrupted by physical imperfections and intrusive thoughts.\n\"Do you ever think about dying?\" she blurts out during a disco party, still grinning, her brain still processing a new feeling of existential dread.\nWATCH | How Barbenheimer became a cultural phenomenon:\nWhat is \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019? The cultural phenomenon, explained\n7 days ago\nDuration \n1:47\nWith Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer set to hit theatres on July 21, CBC's Ashley Fraser unpacks why the two films have become a cultural phenomenon spawning memes, T-shirts and double-feature plans.\nHer toast is burnt, her milk is sour, her shower runs cold. Why is this happening? We discover that her real-world owner Gloria (America Ferrera) has been ascribing the true pain of womanhood to a doll that her daughter Sasha loved but has now abandoned. What if there were an Anxiety Barbie\u2122 \u2014 the movie suggests \u2014\u00a0or a Barbie with flat feet and cellulite? Now that would be representation.\nBarbie jumps in her hot pink convertible, where she's surprised and dismayed to find that her boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) \u2014 needy, adoring, submissive \u2014 will be joining her on a mission to the real world. Oblivious to what goes on outside Barbieland, a harmonious matriarchy where every day is perfect and every night is girl's night, they quickly discover that the real world isn't what they thought. Barbie is appalled by our misogynistic mess; Ken is enamoured with our patriarchal ways.\nMany will be pleased to know that Gosling is, without a doubt, the movie's most valuable player. His Ken is sweet and silly \u2014 until he goes delightfully berserk as a patriarchy-empowered strongman who is both menacing and ridiculous, staging a coup d'\u00e9tat on Barbieland after getting a taste of a male-centred world order.\nWhen Barbie returns, he's imposed a new society where Barbies serve\u00a0brewskies to the Kens, who now fix cars, play sports\u00a0and do reps. Just don't expect any grand insights about the nature of violent masculinity; \nBarbie \nis more concerned with the impossible question of modern womanhood.\nYet\u00a0there isn't an answer, hence the 50-year hubbub about the doll's societal worth. \nBarbie \noffers that the tired, excitement-seeking Glorias of the world \u2014 the people who love Barbie so much they want a doll who can reflect their identity and experience back at them \u2014 and the young, cynical Sashas \u2014 who hate Barbie for her unattainability, for being designed for the male gaze \u2014 can live with and be comfortable with a contradictory existence.\nIf you're a Barbie agnostic who doesn't give a damn about how we project our complexities onto something as simple as a doll and just wanted to see a good movie, we're full-throttle into meta-comedy territory here. The bright technicolor, ambitious set design (there are hints of \nThe Truman Show\n in its intentional artifice) and a few dazzling, high-concept dance sequences lend an escape that we could probably all use.\u00a0\nBarbie is a vision of feminine ideals \u2014 with effortless beauty and brains \u2014 until her flawless lifestyle in Barbieland is disrupted by physical imperfections and intrusive thoughts.\n \n(Warner Bros.)\nBut something itched at me as the movie wore on. Gerwig, whose roots are in independent film, had the tall task of overseeing a Barbie movie that depicts its producer Mattel without bending knee to corporate micromanaging. While the script doesn't handle the company with kid gloves (a CEO character played by Will Ferrell defends his feminist credentials by calling himself \"the nephew of a female aunt,\" before ordering his all-male board to seize the escaped \"jezebel\" Barbie and put her into a box), it lacked the sharp teeth that we've come to expect from a Gerwig-Baumbach venture.\nREVIEW\nBleak, beautiful Oppenheimer tells us about our apocalyptic future\nBlockbusters are failing spectacularly, but how that changes Hollywood is anyone's guess\nVietnam bans Barbie movie over South China Sea map\nThe earnestness with which this movie approaches its primary subject is sweet and necessary \u2014 it almost works the whole way through, and as Gerwig said in a \nrecent interview with The New York Times\n, it wouldn't have worked any other way. But it requires a delicate balance that is hard to pull off, particularly when you're trying to convince an audience to care about a plastic commodity produced by a multibillion dollar company.\nI felt an uneasiness bubble up inside me during a borderline saccharine scene when Barbie interacts with the real-life woman who invented her, Ruth Handler (portrayed by Rhea Perlman). Handler's role during this scene is to remind Barbie of her purpose, and she returns during the film's rushed conclusion to do so again.\nLISTEN | Why are movies about products everywhere?\nFront Burner\n22:52\nWhy movies about products are everywhere\nPerhaps these scenes jarred me because they felt designed to tug at the heartstrings, introducing a human element to give Mattel a face that was easier to swallow or reconcile. It seemed to dilute the work the filmmakers had done up to that point to establish the corporation as Barbie's adversary, even if a soft and bumbling one. \"Things can be both/and,\" Gerwig said during the aforementioned interview. \"I'm doing the thing and subverting the thing.\"\u00a0\nSomewhere along the way, the balance teetered toward\u00a0doing the thing. So when Handler appears to tell Barbie that she was created so that she \"wouldn't have an ending,\" I felt my own existential dread bubble to the surface. There are things to love and hate about Barbie; there are things to love and hate about the \nBarbie \nmovie, too.\u00a0\nHow the Barbie movie marketing machine tapped into a cultural zeitgeist",

One thing I saw this week was a bunch of country music fans that could see through a lot of the bullshit, all right?\"\nFor those wondering if he would play the song live, he said:\u00a0\"The answer is simple.

        "content": "A Montreal woman is gaining exposure \u2013 and making money \u2013 by performing unusual actions requested by fans live on TikTok. She'll say, \"Yes, yes, yes!\" And then, in quick succession, she slurps, then shouts, \"Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!\"\nThis seemingly erratic behaviour can go on for 90 minutes at a time.\u00a0Here's a sampling:\nIt all relates back to a virtual trend called NPC streaming, in which real people try to act like video game characters called NPCs\n \n(non-player\u00a0characters)\n \u2014\u00a0\nbackground characters that perform the same actions over and over while the game is going on. Pinkydoll says she's making good money acting out these strange scenes.\nConfused? You're not alone.\u00a0\nHere's your primer on who Pinkydoll is, how she earns money acting like a video game character, and what the trend says about internet culture.\u00a0\nWho is Pinkydoll?\nPinkydoll's real name is Fedha Sinon. She is 27 years old and lives in Montreal. On TikTok, her account is called \nPinkydollreal\n; she has more than 750,000 followers. She's also an adult content creator.\nSinon\u00a0broadcasts her live videos for TikTok in an apartment, often with the kitchen in the background.\n\"I'm getting a lot of attention right now. You could say it's not always the best attention, but whatever, it's good for my pockets,\" she\u00a0said in a recent interview with Radio-Canada's \nD\u00e9crypteurs\n.\u00a0\nSome teachers are using TikTok to reach teens, but concern over app's effects persists\nToronto dancer Julia Slater has 1.2 million fans on TikTok (but she dances even when no one is watching)\nWhat does she do on TikTok, exactly?\nSinon is one of many TikTokers who have hopped onto\u00a0the NPC streaming trend.\u00a0During the livestreams, fans send her virtual gifts \u2014\u00a0little stickers like hearts that she responds to with a particular action that an NPC might do on a loop within a game. The stickers are cues for her to perform certain actions. The audience is, in effect, controlling the show.\nBut it's live, and can be unpredictable. Sinon at times breaks character to\u00a0chastise\u00a0a child who's off-screen for spitting on the dog.\n\ud83d\ude15 i\u2019ve never been more confused in my entire life dawg\u2026\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/Y43gcySN1k\">pic.twitter.com/Y43gcySN1k</a>\n&mdash;\n@marlolifts\nWhy is Pinkydoll getting attention?\nSinon's account gained a lot of attention after someone posted recordings of her live performances out of context on Twitter. She's since been featured in the \nNew York Times\n and \nRolling Stone\n, among other major media outlets.\nShe's also quickly assumed a role in popular culture. One of her signature phrases \u2014 \"Ice cream so good. Mmm, ice cream so good\" \u2014\u00a0 is featured in a popular meme of Joe Biden holding an ice cream cone and posing with a woman.\nMusic producer Timbaland\u00a0has also featured Sinon in some of his own \nTikTok videos\n, giving her a boost. Elon Musk also got in on the act.\nYes yes yes ice cream so goood \ud83e\udd0d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/pinkydoll?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#pinkydoll</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/yCj8wHHkLB\">pic.twitter.com/yCj8wHHkLB</a>\n&mdash;\n@pinkydollrealb\nBut Sinon is by no means the only TikToker leveraging\u00a0the trend. Other content creators on TikTok, many of whom are also present on the adult site OnlyFans, are also performing nonsensical streams in response to fan prompts. There's a sexual undertone to some of it.\n\"I would say it just further plays into this idea of oversexualized women engaging peripherally in gaming cultures,\" Rachel Kowert, a research psychologist who specializes in gaming communities, \ntold The Daily Beast\n. \"They're NPCs, not main characters, and it is definitely playing into that.\"\nHow do NPC streamers like Pinkydoll make money?\nPopular culture is moving so fast online that it's hard to keep up with the many memes and trends on each platform. But in this case, some serious commerce seems to be happening.\nEvery time a viewer buys one of the stickers as a gift for a livestreamer like Sinon, the performer makes some money. Some gifts cost viewers a few cents, while others are worth hundreds of dollars. Prompting her to say her signature ice cream phrase\u00a0costs less than two cents.\u00a0\nIn these screen shots, Pinkydoll performs live on TikTok as she receives gifts from fans.\n \n(Pinkydollreal/TikTok)\nShe says she started the whole thing on a whim.\n\"I was just being cute,\" Sinon told the New York Times. \"I remember someone saying, 'Oh my God, you look like an NPC.' And then they start sending me, like, crazy money.\"\nHow much is that? She told the New York Times she makes up to $3,000 US per stream. She also appears on other platforms and suggested she makes $7,000 a day.\u00a0\nQ&A\nHBO's The Last Of Us satisfies cravings of new fans and video game die-hards: critic\nAnd that might just be the start. In \na recent TikTok\n, she announced she's on her way to Hollywood.\n\"Where you at? If you're here, manifest yourself,\" she tells the camera. \"Wooo! We about to get it, baby.\"",

        "summary": "One of fast fashion's largest players, Zara, has laid out ambitious new sustainability targets as the European Commission looks to regulate the industry. Advocates say Canada still has a long way to go.",
        "content": "One of fast fashion's biggest players\u00a0says it's taking major steps toward a more sustainable business model. But in an industry predicated on low cost, low quality and high production volume, experts say it won't be simple.\n\"It's hard to see how they actually deliver on their emissions reductions targets,\" said Ken Pucker, a lecturer at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., who focuses on sustainability.\n\"Because volumes are going to continue to go up.\"\nIn an ambitious new plan, Inditex, Zara's parent company, announced earlier this month\u00a0that it will seek to cut its emissions in half\u00a0by 2030, and become net zero by 2040. It also says it will transition to using materials that last longer and are easier to recycle.\nUsed clothes are shown discarded in the Atacama Desert, in Alto Hospicio, Chile. In 2021, the World Economic Forum identified the fashion industry as the world\u2019s third-largest polluter.\n \n(Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty )\nExperts say the move signals a shift toward\u00a0a circular business model \u2014 meaning materials get reused and regenerated instead of thrown away \u2014 as the fashion industry faces more and more criticism over its outsized environmental footprint.\nIn 2021, the \nWorld Economic Forum\n identified the fashion industry as the world's third-largest polluter. And as the trend cycle accelerates, most of the clothing purchased is only worn seven times before it's thrown out, according to a \n2015 British study\n.\nUltra-fast fashion site Shein has captured the wallets of young shoppers. But at what cost?\nIn its new plan, Zara says 40 per cent of the Spanish-based international clothing chain's\u00a0fibres will come from recycled material, 25 per cent from sustainably farmed crops, and another 25 per cent from \"next-generation materials\" that Inditex is investing in.\nThe big problem, say experts, is that the company shows no signs of slowing production, raising questions around how realistic these targets are.\n\"To get to their targets, these things all have to happen yesterday. And I worry that there is insufficient financial incentive and time that will compromise their ability to deliver on their goals,\" said Pucker.\nInditex, the parent company of fast-fashion retailer Zara, announced on July 11 that it will aim to cut its emissions in half by 2030, and become net zero by 2040.\n \n(Andrea Comas/Reuters)\nThe fast fashion industry is expanding.\u00a0Companies such as\u00a0Shein and Fashion Nova, for instance, have gained huge popularity through social media, where Shein has 29.6 million followers on Instagram and people regularly post their fashion hauls on TikTok.\nFor fast fashion, the need to continually produce and grow presents a paradox, said Shivika Sinha, founder of the U.S.-based sustainable styling service Veneka.\n\"The paradox is that Zara is one of the originators of the fast-fashion model,\" Sinha said. \"It's going to be tough for them to implement.\"\nStill, Sinha said she believes Zara's targets are achievable.\n\"There is enough innovation on recycling for Zara to achieve these goals,\" she said. \"I think it's a matter of Zara's culture and where they prioritize their funding toward these sorts of projects, and how the EU is holding them accountable.\"\nMotivating companies to make less\nZara's accelerated new goals come as the European Commission is drawing up a slew of new regulations that will require fashion companies to produce clothes in a more sustainable way and take accountability for their environmental impacts.\nThe Commission is proposing to\u00a0introduce \nExtended Producer Responsibility (EPR)\n\u00a0schemes for textiles in all EU member states, making\u00a0producers responsible for the full life cycle of their products.\u00a0Once implemented, producers would become responsible for the cost of managing their textile waste.\nWhat on Earth?\nWhat's the ideal amount of clothing in a sustainable wardrobe?\nAccording to the\u00a0\nEuropean Environment Agency\n, in 2019, 46 per cent of Europe's used textiles ended up in African countries. The agency says what isn't fit for reuse often ends up in open landfills and informal waste streams.\nThe idea behind EPR schemes is to motivate companies to make fewer garments, said\u00a0Kelly Drennan, executive director of Fashion Takes Action, a non-profit in Toronto.\n\"The more garments they make, the higher the cost is going to be to manage the end of life. So if they can actually slow down the production, produce less, then that is actually going to save them money in the end,\" she said.\nKen Pucker is a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., who focuses on sustainability.  \n \n(Submitted by Ken Pucker)\nDrennan says she is hopeful of the impact Europe's EPR rules could have on Canada.\n\"We'll benefit, ultimately, from seeing clothing that is made from more sustainably sourced materials, that is more durable, that has the end of life considered at the time that it is being designed.\u00a0And hopefully we'll see less waste as a result.\"\nIs Canada falling behind?\nIn Canada, there are no EPR programs in place specifically for textiles, Drennan said. That's because much of our waste is managed at a provincial or municipal level, with little harmonization across provinces.\nDrennan estimates it will take approximately 10 years before Canada builds up to a textile EPR scheme for its own textile companies. Canadians toss nearly 500 million kilograms of fabric items every year, according to \nresearchers at the University of Waterloo\n.\nWhat you need to know about Temu, the online shopping app dominating download charts\nMarketplace\nExperts warn of high levels of chemicals in clothes by some fast-fashion retailers\nWithout proper legislation,\u00a0it's up to companies to take the lead, Drennan said, noting\u00a0policies like those in Europe are the only way the industry will make significant changes.\n\"While there are some leaders investing time, money and research into sustainability, circularity and human rights initiatives, most brands are not.\u00a0And it's going to take legislation for them to start thinking differently.\"\nKelly Drennan is the executive director of Fashion Takes Action, a Canadian non-profit that works to advance sustainability in the fashion industry.\n \n(Submitted by Kelly Drennan)\nBut even as fast-fashion companies such as Zara attempt to reduce their ecological footprint, Drennan anticipates an even bigger challenge for the industry:\u00a0\nultra-fast fashion\n.\n\"Historically, they (Zara, H&M) are the king and queen of fast fashion,\" she said.\n\"The challenging aspect we're facing right now is a new era of fast fashion, or what we're calling ultra-fast fashion, with brands like Shein\u00a0and Fashion Nova and Boohoo that are pumping out thousands of styles every single day. We're hopeful that EPR legislation will impact those brands down the road.\"\nBales of sorted second-hand clothes are seen being piled up at a facility operated by Zheng-chuan textile recycling factory in New Taipei City, Taiwan, on July 15, 2022. Canadians alone toss nearly 500 million kilograms of fabric items every year, according to researchers at the University of Waterloo.\n \n(Annabelle Chih/Getty)",

It's the first time both unions have been on strike at the same time since 1960.\nThe stoppage has shuttered nearly all film and television production. Actors say the streaming revolution has altered pay in entertainment, stripping them of residuals and remaking working conditions. They are also seeking guardrails against the use of artificial intelligence, along with increases to the union's health care and pension programs.\nFrom left, Oscar-winning actors Brendan Fraser and F. Murray Abraham are shown at the Tuesday rally in Times Square.\n \n(Charles Sykes/The Associated Press)\n\"Our industry has changed exponentially,\" said Cranston. \"We are not in the same business model that we were in even 10 years ago. And yet, even though they admit that that's the truth in today's economy, they are fighting us tooth and nail to stick to the same economic system that is outmoded, outdated. They want us to step back in time.\"\nThe AMPTP has said it presented actors with a generous deal that included the biggest bump in minimum pay in 35 years among other benefits. Since talks broke off and SAG-AFTRA commenced the strike, the sides have not negotiated and no talks are scheduled.\n\"We may be on strike but I said to them on July 12 we are ready to continue talking tomorrow and every day after until we reach a deal,\" said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA. \"And I've said that every day since to the media, to them, to anyone who would listen. SAG-AFTRA is ready, willing and able to return to the bargaining table.\n\"The only reason we aren't there now is because those companies said that they didn't want to deal with people who were uncivilized and because those companies said they wouldn't be ready to talk for quite some time,\" added Crabtree-Ireland.\nMany actors Tuesday cast the strike in personal terms. Christian Slater said the union's health care helped sustain his father's life. Slater's father, the actor Michael Hawkins, died last November.

But the utterance of the name in relation to the site of Canada's largest disaster instantly conjures up images of destruction on an epic scale.\nOn Dec. 6, 1917,\u00a0a\u00a0French munitions ship\u00a0and a Norwegian steamship carrying relief supplies collided in \nHalifax\n\u00a0harbour, resulting in one of the largest human-made explosions.

Robert Oppenheimer,\u00a0known\u00a0as the\u00a0\"father of the atomic bomb,\" would go on to study \nthe Halifax explosion\n to predict the effects of the atomic bomb.\nIt's one of Canada's many recognized ties with the making of the world's first nuclear weapon\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0including the supply of uranium, the discovery of\u00a0nuclear fission\u00a0and the Trinity test.\u00a0\nHere's a look at several ways Canada\u00a0factored into the\u00a0development of the atomic bomb.\nThis composite photo shows the mushroom cloud produced during the first atomic explosion test on July 16, 1945.

Every marble signifies the United States' plutonium and uranium resources. Once the\u00a0containers are filled to the brim, Oppenheimer gives the\u00a0go-ahead for the first\u00a0test of the atomic bomb.\u00a0\nMost of the uranium for the bomb's critical mass came from somewhere near Port Radium in the Northwest Territories.\u00a0\nWATCH | What is 'Barbenheimer'? The cultural phenomenon, explained:\u00a0\nWhat is \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019? The cultural phenomenon, explained\n7 days ago\nDuration \n1:47\nWith Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer set to hit theatres on July 21, CBC's Ashley Fraser unpacks why the two films have become a cultural phenomenon spawning memes, T-shirts and double-feature plans.\n\u00a0\nAccording to Ron Verzuh, a B.C.-based historian and writer,\u00a0the U.S. had \"a lot of control of all the uranium that was coming out of Canada.\"\nIn May 1930, Canadian prospector Gilbert Labine discovered radium and uranium deposits at Port Radium in Canada's Northwest Territories while exploring a nearby island on Great Bear Lake, according to The National Museum of Nuclear Science and History.\u00a0\nThe beach at Port Radium, N.W.T., where uranium ore used for the atomic bomb was once loaded onto barges for shipment to the U.S. \n \n(Bob Weber/The Canadian Press)\nLabine immediately staked his claim and established the Eldorado Mining Company to extract and refine the rich radium deposits. But for much of the 1930s, uranium was simply a byproduct of the refining process, and the company had little use for it.\nWhen radium prices dropped due to foreign competition, operations at the mine slowed\u00a0and by June 1940 it\u00a0had closed.\nBut the slowdown was only temporary.\u00a0\nHalifax Explosion at 100: A devastating disaster that left a lasting mark\nSpectre of atomic bomb still looms over N.W.T. community 75 years after Hiroshima\nThe discovery of nuclear fission in December 1938 led to a worldwide rush for uranium. In 1942, the Eldorado mine was reopened to supply the U.S. government with the uranium needed for the atomic bomb.\u00a0\nVerzuh says it's difficult to pinpoint the amount\u00a0of Canadian uranium used in the bomb,\u00a0but he says it was significant.\n\"There were other sources, including some sources in Africa as well, but the uranium coming out of the Eldorado mine was of top quality for the purposes they wanted it for,\" he said.\u00a0\nA miner hauls a car of uranium ore at Eldorado Mine near Great Bear Lake, N.W.T., in the 1930s. Radium mining ended at the mine in 1939, but it was soon reopened to supply the U.S. with the uranium needed to develop the nuclear bomb. \n \n(Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission)\nFrom 1942 until 1945, workers mined hundreds of tons of uranium ore and shipped it\u00a0across the country to Port Hope, Ont., where it\u00a0was refined and later delivered to Los Alamos to be used in Oppenheimer's atomic bomb, according to The Atomic Heritage Foundation, a U.S. group devoted to researching the Manhattan Project, the program that developed the world's first nuclear weapons.\nManhattan Project's\u00a0Quebec beginnings\nAt 1943's\u00a0\nQuebec Conference\n, part of a series of\u00a0strategic meetings\u00a0by Allied leaders during the Second World War, Britain and\u00a0the United States merged their nuclear weapons research into a single effort. Britain had been leading in nuclear research in the late 1930s, but fell behind due to dwindling\u00a0resources as a result of the war.\u00a0\nThe joint effort agreed to in \nQuebec\n would later assume the code name of the U.S. effort: the Manhattan Project.\nU.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson presents the Enrico Fermi Award to nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer at the White House in December 1963.\n \n(Washington Bureau/Getty Images)\nAnother Quebec connection\u00a0in \nOppenheimer\n features a group of people rushing into Oppenheimer's office after they read\u00a0a newspaper story that says atoms can be split, not just theoretically, but also practically.\nThis process, called nuclear fission, only became a reality in late 1938 when German chemist Otto Hahn discovered it with physicist\n\u00a0\nLise Meitner,\u00a0said\u00a0Taylor Noakes, a Montreal-based historian.\u00a0\nHahn had previously worked with\u00a0Nobel Prize-winning physicist\u00a0Ernest Rutherford at McGill University in 1905 and 1906.\nB.C.

CBC film critics Eli Glasner and Jackson Weaver share their take.\nAs a result,\u00a0Verzuh says the U.S. began\u00a0stockpiling heavy water\u00a0to supply the Manhattan Project, and the \nCominco\n\u00a0smelting operation in\u00a0\nTrail, B.C.\n, was upgraded to produce heavy water on an industrial scale.\n\"The heavy water would go into the production of the bomb,\" said Verzuh, who is the author of a paper titled \"How a small B.C. city helped create the world's first weapon of mass destruction.\" At the time, he\u00a0said, that was considered the best way to create nuclear fission.\u00a0\nHe\u00a0says that though the heavy water was never used in the nuclear tests or in the weapons used to bomb Japan, it was a \"primary ingredient\"\u00a0in the bomb's development.\u00a0\nA replica of the 'Christy Gadget' that was detonated during the Trinity test in 1945, is displayed at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History in New Mexico.

Trevor Ewan, chief projectionist at the Kramer Imax Theatre, tells As It Happens host Nil K\u00f6ksal about the struggles they've faced \u2014 and why they all might be worth it.\nEssentially, Canadians made three major contributions in support of the Manhattan Project: the establishment of nuclear research facilities in Canada, the delivery of critical raw materials to U.S.\u00a0facilities\u00a0and the direct involvement of several Canadians in the project.\nHistorians\u00a0\nhave said\n\u00a0these wartime efforts helped Canada achieve long-term gains in\u00a0nuclear energy and placed the country\u00a0among global leaders in nuclear research following the war.\nThe front page of the Daily Express reports on the Manhattan Project's discovery that atomic power could be harnessed to meet energy needs.  \n \n(Express Newspapers/Getty Images)",

They just continued to take his premiums. They never addressed it. They didn't put an addendum on his insurance policy.\"\nVal's son Josh Jantzen had two policies, one\u00a0for mortgage insurance and one for a line of credit, to ensure those debts would be paid out in the event of his death.\nVal is also disappointed that judges at Court of King's Bench and the Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal both sided with the insurers when she went to court to try and force the companies to pay.\nThe Court of Appeal decision was written by Justice Robert Leurer and published earlier this month.\nVal\u00a0is not the only one disappointed.\n\"I think it's just another example of how we continue to criminalize substance use disorders in our country and around the world,\" said Kayla DeMong, executive director of Prairie Harm Reduction.\n\"We recognize the underlying issues that often push somebody into substance use disorder, but when it comes down to it we're making moralistic judgments on a person and criminalizing what should be treated as a health issue.\"\n1,200 people have died from overdoses in Saskatchewan in 3 years. Who were they?\nJosh, 37,\u00a0was found dead in his home in Saskatoon on Feb. 1, 2018. The autopsy concluded that he had a fatal amount of alcohol and cocaine in his system.\nJosh\u00a0had struggled with addictions for at least a decade, according to his mother. He worked at a potash mine and had gone through rehab three times, but continued to relapse.\nVal was quick to point out that her son was not completely defined by his addictions. He grew up in a middle-class Saskatoon home with three brothers. He played sports, rode motorcycles, and went hunting and fishing. Josh worked hard, paid his bills and had a serious relationship.\nJosh was self-aware enough to seek help on his own and conscientious enough to not lie about his struggles when he got insurance, according to Val.\nKayla DeMong is executive director of Prairie Harm Reduction in Saskatoon.\n \n(CBC)\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that \"the insurers properly denied coverage because Mr. Jantzen died as a result of committing the crime of possession of the cocaine that he consumed.\"\nTD Life Insurance Company and Canada Life Assurance Company both declined interview requests.\nWATCH\u00a0|\u00a0Sask. high court upholds decision to not pay insurance to estate of man who died of drug overdose:\n\u00a0\nSask. high court upholds decision to not pay insurance to estate of man who died of drug overdose\n8 days ago\nDuration \n2:44\nVal Jantzen is angry that two insurance companies continued to take premiums from her son while knowing that he was addicted to cocaine, and then denied coverage after he died of a cocaine overdose in 2018.\nKevin Dorse, with the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association Inc., said he couldn't speak to the specifics of this case.\n\"What we can say is that it is very common for life insurance policies sold in all parts of Canada to contain provisions that will exclude or limit payment of a claim where death occurs in specific circumstances,\" he said in an email.\nSaskatoon supervised consumption site receives no part of province's addiction funding for 4th year\nLori Sandstrom, who teaches insurance law at the University of Saskatchewan, said insurance companies across the country will be well aware of this decision.\n\"I think this decision is important because it's interpreting an exclusion clause in a policy, and insurers are always looking for how court is going to interpret an exclusion clause,\" Sandstrom said.\n\"They're looking at a sequence of events, so you can tell from both decisions that the court was looking to similar exclusion clauses and other policies in different factual situations and applying it here \u2026 so you could see that interpretations, if persuasive, are relied upon across Canada.\"\nSandstrom is also disappointed with how addictions are criminalized \u2014 and the broader implications of the Court of Appeal ruling.\n\"Because as a society we have chosen not to decriminalize possession for personal use, despite it being an addiction, I think this interpretation may have quite broad implications,\" she said.\n\"We have a lot of people, I think, struggling with addictions, and now because of the interpretation that courts have given, exclusion clauses such as this, they may face forfeiting their insurance as a result of an addiction.\"\nDeMong said that Josh and his family are being punished for something that doesn't warrant punishment.\n\"They're happy to take his money. They're happy to take his premiums. They're happy to work with him as long as they're financially gaining from this situation,\" she said.\n\"And the moment that they have to pay that out and live up to their end of the agreement, it becomes, again, this bad versus good situation, and they've deemed it bad.\"",

        "content": "The World Health Organization said more than two dozen cats have been infected with bird flu across Poland, but no people appeared to have been sickened.\nIn a statement on Monday, the UN\u00a0health agency said it was the first time so many cats had been reported to have bird flu over such a wide geographical area in a single country, amid an unprecedented global outbreak of the latest version of the H5N1 version of the disease.\nWHO said that late last month, Polish authorities informed agency officials of the unusual deaths of more than 45 cats in 13 geographical regions of the country. Testing last week found that 29 had H5N1.\nAs of June, the most recent variant of H5N1 has been reported in birds and other animal species in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Since 2020, WHO said a dozen human cases have been reported.\nScientists worry that rising cases of H5N1, particularly in animals that have frequent contact with humans, might lead to a\u00a0mutated version of the disease that could spread easily between people, triggering another pandemic.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, many experts had suspected that the next global outbreak would be sparked by H5N1.\nBut while bird flu has killed hundreds of millions of birds globally, it has sickened fewer than 900 people since 2003 and has not been able to spread easily among humans.\nSask. scientists developing vaccines to protect birds and humans from avian flu\nNew avian flu virus subtype found in P.E.I. birds and raccoons\nWHO said it was unclear how the domestic cats in Poland became infected with bird flu and said officials were still investigating possible sources of exposure, including contact with wild birds that are known to carry H5N1.\nThe agency said the risk of people in Poland being infected with bird flu was \"low\" and \"low to moderate\" for people exposed to cats, including cat owners and veterinarians.\nLast week, WHO and partners warned that the increasing numbers of mammals infected with H5N1 were unusual. Experts have previously cautioned that pigs, which are susceptible to flu viruses from both humans and birds, might act as a \"mixing vessel,\" leading to the emergence of mutated viruses that could be lethal to people.\nCape St. Mary's birds were decimated by last year's avian flu, and the reserve fears a repeat in 2023\nSince last year, authorities in 10 countries have reported bird flu outbreaks in mammals, including farmed mink in Spain, seals in the U.S., and sea lions in Peru and Chile.",

It affects myelin, which acts as a sort of \"insulator\" around nerve fibres in the brain, as well as the spinal cord.\nCurrently, the only accepted treatment for the disease is a bone marrow (stem cell) transplant \u2014 which is accompanied by aggressive treatment within a specific window.\nCurrently, Bowin is being cared for by doctors from the B.C. Children's Hospital.\n \n(Justine Boulin/CBC)\nWhile Bowin is in the care of doctors at the B.C. Children's\u00a0Hospital, a University of Calgary expert says the doctors with the most experience treating ALD are based in the U.S., in Minnesota.\n\"We don't love the idea of having to leave our entire life to go down somewhere foreign for six months,\" Chantel told CBC News. \"Although, you know, it could be a great opportunity.\"\nBut the family hasn't been told if the province would fund their out-of-state treatment in Minnesota.

And as [someone] who's been through something hard, finding the purpose in it helps sort of see you through.\"\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans show minor brain damage for Bowin, according to his parents.\n \n(Justine Boulin/CBC)\nDisease more often seen in young boys\nDr. Kim McBride, the department head of medical genetics at the University of Calgary, said the disease is extremely uncommon. He estimates it at around one in 15,000 individuals.\n\"[It's] an interesting disease,\" he said. \"Even though you may have a genetic change that says you may develop this disease, you may not always get it.\"\nMcBride says the only other option for\u00a0ALD treatment is gene therapy \u2014 which has been approved in the U.S. and Europe, but not in Canada.\nSaskatoon family stuck with $1 million bill for life-saving treatment for their son in U.S.\nFamily who went to U.S. for son's medical procedure asks Sask. to reconsider funding treatment\nThe doctor also said that the disease, while uncommon, is more often seen in young boys than girls.\nOne of those boys is \nSaskatoon child Conner Finn\n, who was diagnosed with ALD shortly after COVID-19 restrictions came into place in June 2020.\nFinn's family had to \nliquidate their life savings\n\u00a0to move to Minnesota and get Conner treatment there \u2014 something that ended up saving him.\nWhile the province of Saskatchewan initially refused to cover the child's treatment, they eventually \nprovided more than $800,000\n after advocacy from Conner's mother, Kirsten.\nKirsten Finn said her family had to make numerous sacrifices, like moving from Saskatoon to the United States, in order stay afloat and get their son Conner the treatment he needed in 2020.\n \n(Bryan Eneas/CBC)\nIn an interview with CBC News, Kirsten said that all provinces in Canada should consider screening for the disease at birth \u2014 something she says already happens in 37 U.S. states.\n\"When you look at it like the cost of screening versus the cost of the medical care that might come later on and as a result of not screening \u2014 it's really a no-brainer,\" she said.\nMcBride said the cost of an ALD test for a newborn would not be any more expensive than regular mandatory tests.\nSask. reimburses family who went to U.S. for son's medical procedure\nFinn says she is pushing for more people to add themselves to \nthe stem cell donor registry\n.\nShe also says provinces should be more open to covering out-of-province medical costs for ALD, potentially by partnering with U.S. laboratories that are specialized in rarer diseases.\nHope and heartbreak: Expensive drugs for rare diseases are both a gift and a challenge\nA spokesperson for the B.C. Ministry of Health said they could not comment on Funk's individual case, but that generally, a medical specialist should provide a referral so the provincial medical insurer can cover out-of-province costs.\n\"The specialist needs to provide information about what other treatment options have been explored elsewhere in B.C. and/or Canada,\" they said.\u00a0\n\"Treatment that is considered to be experimental or still in the developmental (research) stage is not eligible for coverage.\"",

        "content": "Another experimental Alzheimer's drug can modestly slow patients' inevitable worsening \u2014\u00a0by about four to seven months, researchers reported Monday.\nEli Lilly and Co. is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of donanemab. If cleared, it would be only the second Alzheimer's treatment convincingly shown to delay the mind-robbing disease,\u00a0\nafter the recently approved Leqembi from Japanese drugmaker Eisai\n.\n\"Finally there's some hope, right, that we can talk about,\" Lilly's Dr. John Sims told reporters Monday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Amsterdam.\n\"We don't cure the disease,\" he said. \"Diabetes doesn't have a cure either. It\u00a0doesn't mean you can't have very meaningful treatments for patients.\"\nLilly announced in May that donanemab appeared to work, but on Monday the \nfull results of a study of 1,700 patients\n were\u00a0published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and presented at the Alzheimer's conference.\nThis image provided by Eisai in January shows vials and packaging for its Alzheimer's medication Leqembi. On Monday, Eli Lilly and Co. released data from its study of 1,700 patients showing its Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, also slows progression of the disease.\n \n(Eisai/The Associated Press)\nBoth donanemab and Leqembi are lab-made antibodies, administered by IV, that target one Alzheimer's culprit:\u00a0sticky amyloid buildup in the brain. Both drugs come with a serious safety concern \u2014 brain swelling or bleeding that in the Lilly study was linked to three deaths.\nLeqembi and donanemab are not approved in Canada.\u00a0\nIn an email to CBC News, a Health Canada spokesperson said that Leqembi\u00a0is listed as under review on the agency's new drug submission website. The drug's application was accepted for review in May.\u00a0\nHealth Canada says it doesn't comment on drugs that are under review, and that timing of these submissions depends\u00a0on many factors, including a need for more data, talks with the sponsor and requirements for updates to safety information.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, donanemab\u00a0has not been submitted for review, according to Health Canada's website.\u00a0 \nThe Alzheimer\u00a0Society of Canada's CEO Christopher Barry told CBC News in an email that the society is \"hopeful that new advancements in research will bring more treatment options to Canadians.\"\nBarry added that long-term trial data will be crucial in\u00a0understanding the risks and benefits for people living with dementia.\u00a0\nQuestions remain about which patients will benefit\nScientists say while these drugs may mark a new era in Alzheimer's therapy, huge questions remain about which patients\n should try them and how much benefit they'll really notice.\n\"The modest benefits would likely not be questioned by patients, clinicians or payers if amyloid antibodies were low risk, inexpensive and simple to administer. However, they are none of these,\" Dr. Eric Widera, of the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in a JAMA editorial accompanying Lilly's new data.\nLilly's study enrolled people aged 60 to 85 who were in early stages of Alzheimer's. Half received once-a-month infusions of donanemab and half\u00a0got dummy infusions for 18 months.\nAlzheimer's drug Leqembi has full FDA approval in the U.S. now and that means Medicare will pay for it\n2nd clinical trials for promising Alzheimer's drug to take place at U of Sask.\nThe study had a few twists. Patients were switched to dummy infusions if enough amyloid cleared out \u2014\u00a0something that happened to about half within a year.\nAnd because amyloid alone doesn't cause Alzheimer's, researchers also tracked levels of another culprit in the brain \u2014\u00a0abnormal tau. More tau signals more advanced disease.\nThe results: both groups declined during the 18-month study, but overall, those given donanemab worsened about 22 per cent\u00a0more slowly. Some patients fared better \u2014\u00a0those with low to medium tau levels saw a 35 per cent\u00a0slower decline, reflecting that the drug appears to work better in earlier stages of the disease.\nWATCH |\u00a0New Alzheimer's drug\u00a0Leqembi met with hope and caution:\nHope and anxiety surround new Alzheimer\u2019s drug lecanemab\n8 months ago\nDuration \n3:43\nTwo pharmaceutical companies say a drug they\u2019ve developed has the potential to slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s, something no treatment has been able to do. Now, researchers and those impacted by the disease are anxiously awaiting the full results of a human trial for the medication.\nDrug slows disease progression\u00a0by 4 to 7 months\nHow much difference does that make? It means donanemab slowed patients' worsening by about four to seven months, the JAMA report concluded.\nAnother way of measuring: among the donanemab recipients with lower tau levels, 47 per cent\u00a0were considered stable a year into the study compared with 29 per cent\u00a0of those who got the dummy version.\nThe main safety concern is brain swelling or bleeding, which often causes no symptoms but sometimes can be serious, even fatal. About a quarter of donanemab recipients showed evidence of that swelling, and about 20 per cent\u00a0had microbleeds.\nScientists already know that patients getting any amyloid-targeted therapy need repeat brain scans to check for those\n side effects \u2014\u00a0a costly and time-consuming hurdle.\nWidera noted that the possibility of stopping donanemab treatment at least temporarily in people who respond well would help limit some of those challenges. For comparison, Leqembi is given by IV every two weeks and researchers didn't test a similar stoppage.\nIt's too soon to know if some patients might need to resume donanemab, said Lilly's Dr. Mark Mintun.\nBut the amyloid \"doesn't come back with any sort of vengeance,\" he said, speculating that might take several years.\nCanada's health-care system 'not ready,' expert says\nNeurologist Carmela Tartaglia, with the University Health Network's Krembil Brain Institute in Toronto,\u00a0told CBC News that while the findings are \"very promising,\" it's important people know that it's not a \"miracle\" and \"doesn't stop the disease altogether.\"\nBut the delay it creates, Tartaglia\u00a0said, can give people some extra time with a\u00a0loved one.\u00a0\n\"Keeping people out of nursing homes is very much clinically meaningful for our patients,\" she said. \"Even if it's only six months\u00a0\u2014 and that seems like not that much for us in the bigger scheme of a lifetime\u00a0\u2014\u00a0six months extra with a loved one is actually hugely meaningful for many of our patients and their families.\"\u00a0\nShe\u00a0said\u00a0this drug still comes with its limitations, however, such as whether the plaque will eventually\u00a0return\u00a0after patients stop the medication.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to the future of a drug like this in Canada, Tartaglia suggested\u00a0our health system is \"not ready\" for this type of treatment.\u00a0\nPeople approved for the drug need to be specifically diagnosed and tested, they'll need to get infusions and will then need to be monitored with constant MRIs \u2014 all of this, she said, can't be handled by our current health-care system.\u00a0\n\"I think the drugs have shown their efficacy,\" she said.\u00a0\"The problem is to get the right drug to the right person at the right time; the infrastructure in [the] Canadian health care system has to change.\"\nLack of diversity in study\nAnother concern with the study on donanemab\u00a0is that more than 90 per cent\u00a0of its\u00a0participants were white, leaving little data about how other populations might respond, Alzheimer's specialist Jennifer Manly, of Columbia University, wrote in JAMA.\nScientists have long tried and failed to slow Alzheimer's with\u00a0amyloid-targeting drugs \u2014\u00a0and the FDA's contentious 2021 conditional approval of a drug named Aduhelm soon fizzled amid lack of evidence that it really worked. The approval of Leqembi and promising data for donanemab have reignited interest in attacking amyloid buildup.\nBut Mintun acknowledged additional approaches are needed, saying Lilly expects results of a late-stage study of a tau-fighting drug next year.",

        "summary": "Staying in the ER for hours or even days waiting for a hospital bed should be seen by Canadians as unacceptable, says an emergency physician. But what's the solution for 'waiting-room medicine'?",
        "content": "White Coat Black Art\n26:30\nEmergency rooms in crisis\nStaying in the ER for hours or even days waiting for a hospital bed should be seen by Canadians as unacceptable, says an emergency physician.\nBut Dr. Catherine Varner, who is also deputy editor of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, recently wrote an editorial warning that emergency departments across the country face record-setting \nwait times and closures\n\u00a0this summer.\u00a0\n\"There have been times over the last two years where I'm standing in our waiting room with many patients waiting to be seen, many of whom are uncomfortable and sick, where you want to sort of shout at the rooftops and say, 'This is what a health-care system in collapse looks like,'\" Varner said in an interview with colleague Dr. Brian Goldman, host of CBC Radio's \nWhite Coat, Black Art.\nThis week, premiers committed to \nimproving health care\n as a key priority following their meeting in Winnipeg. This comes as ERs across the country still\u00a0face overcrowding, record wait-times, lack of hospital beds, closures and staff burnout. The situation is critical for some patients, with \nreports across the country\n of people dying while waiting in hospitals.\nSome studies suggest that patients admitted to hospital who have to stay\u00a0in the ER because beds on units aren't available may face a higher risk of dying the \nlonger they stay\n in the emergency department.\nWATCH | Premiers push for more international health-care workers:\u00a0\nPremiers want federal funding, foreign workers to fill health-care gaps\n14 days ago\nDuration \n2:19\nCanada's premiers focused on health-care funding and met with nurses today during their conference in Winnipeg. They are calling on the federal government to keep funding up with demand and help bring more foreign health-care workers to Canada.\nVarner, who works at a Toronto ER,\u00a0said patients start out frustrated. But when people with a fractured hip, for instance, wait hours for hospital admission, they tell her fear sets in, which turns to \"profound disappointment.\"\nTrying to maintain a patient's privacy in a waiting room is challenging, she said.\u00a0This has led to what she says is a new field\u00a0\u2014 waiting-room medicine \u2014 where providers adapt to\u00a0seeing patients sitting on a chair in the waiting room instead of lying on a stretcher or by using unconventional spaces, such as in an ambulance parked on the hospital driveway.\nER doors should never be locked, daughter says\nBut wait-times aren't the only issue facing Canada's\u00a0ERs. Shelley Gosselin's father, Charles Marsh, died before he was even able to get into an open emergency department.\nGosselin said Marsh, 78, was otherwise healthy when he had an asthma attack in February. He drove to the local ER in Bonavista, N.L., for oxygen, but it was unexpectedly closed due to staffing shortages. Marsh called an ambulance the next day and \ndied en route\n to another ER.\nShelley Gosselin, right, said her father, Charles Marsh, might have survived if nurses in the hospital opened the doors to give him oxygen.\n \n(Submitted by Shelley Gosselin)\nGosselin, who spent 25 years working as a nurse in the military, said it is hard to look at the degrading health-care system from both sides, knowing people are dying because their medical needs go unmet.\nFamily blames Bonavista ER closure for man's death in ambulance\nSecond Opinion\nWhy ERs are under intense pressure across Canada \u2014 and how to help fix them\n\"There were nurses in the hospital that could have opened the doors and let him in and given him the oxygen,\" the Ottawa resident claimed on \nThe Current\n last week.\n\"Never, ever should ER doors be locked and turn people who need the basic essentials in life away.\"\nAt the time, Eastern Health said in a statement to CBC News it is unable to publicly discuss any specifics regarding an individual patient case due to the Personal Health Information Act.\nIn March, the province's health minister offered doctors a $200,000 \nsigning bonus\n to work in Bonavista.\n'The safety net'\nDr. Paul Atkinson, deputy editor of the \nCanadian Journal of Emergency Medicine\n, said the\u00a0ER closures in rural areas across the country should not be happening.\u00a0\nBut Atkinson,\u00a0who heads the emergency medicine department for Horizon Health Network in Saint John,\u00a0N.B.,\u00a0notes there's another issue contributing to ER crowding: people who look to ERs for 24/7 access to unscheduled\u00a0care.\nHealth officials won't publicly admit scale of 'crisis' at Surrey Memorial Hospital ER, doctors' letter says\nERs weren't designed for that, he said; they were designed to deal with emergencies such as cardiac arrests, strokes, and limb-threatening injuries.\n\"But how do you do that when you are also the safety net, when you're also the admitting area, the holding area, when you're also the primary care area or the area where people come when they've nowhere to sleep on a cold, Canadian evening?\" he said.\nWATCH |\n\u00a0\nRural and small-town residents worry about summer ER crisis:\n\u00a0\nWhat happens when a town loses its emergency room?\n29 days ago\nDuration \n8:46\nSmaller communities are bearing the brunt of Canada\u2019s health-care crisis with clinics, hospitals and emergency rooms being forced to close or limit access. CBC\u2019s Nick Purdon went to some of those communities to meet the worried patients and the people looking for solutions.\nBoth physicians said there is no easy answer to the ER crisis, calling for more resources. These include increasing\u00a0hospital beds, retaining experienced triage nurses and adding specialists, diagnostic imaging and operating rooms.\nFor instance, Canada has one of the lowest rates of acute care hospital beds per capita of the \nOECD nations\n, at just 2.6\u00a0beds per 1,000 people.\u00a0\nVarner suggested expanding the role of\u00a0nurse practitioners, dietitians and counselors so patients can access \ncomprehensive primary care\n in a \ntimely manner\n. That's important given so many \nfamily physicians are retiring\n as the country's \npopulation also grows\n and \nages\n, she said.\u00a0\nAtkinson hopes innovation, such receiving specialist advice virtually for critically ill patients, will also help staff at smaller ERs to cope better.\nHow paramedics can help\nAs a paramedic in Nova Scotia for more than 40 years, Kevin McMullin sees how his profession also adjusts to new challenges. McMullin figures he's been called to help resuscitate patients experiencing a cardiac arrest in a hospital \"probably at least a half a dozen times in recent years.\"\nMiddleton mayor calls for change after patient death at Soldiers Memorial Hospital\nRural ER docs are struggling to do it all. Peer support programs try to lessen the load\nIn June, a cardiac arrest at Soldiers Memorial Hospital in Middleton, N.S., \nmade headlines\n when nurses had to summon members of the volunteer Middleton Fire Department to resuscitate a patient who was admitted on one of the floors.\nHiring transport operators for routine calls frees up paramedics to handle emergencies. \n \n(Submitted by Emergency Health Services)\nMcMullin, the business manager for the union that represents paramedics and patient transport operators in Nova Scotia, said it is now normal for the province's emergency medical centre to dispatch medical first responders from local fire departments, as well as paramedics, to Code Blues for hospitalized patients.\n\"They mutter and sigh at the system,\" McMullin said of paramedics responding to patients in cardiac arrest in hospital. \"If you're in a rural area, you used to be able to transport to the nearest hospital [that] might only be 15 minutes away. Now your transport may be up to an hour. So, as a result it means that you have patient-care issues for a longer period.\"\nMcMullin's proposed solutions to the ER crunch include:\nHire \ntransport operators\n for routine calls.\nHave clinical paramedics staff the \nemergency call centre\n together with doctors and nurses.\nAllow \ncommunity paramedics\n to follow up on patients discharged from hospital.\nThe Nova Scotia Health Authority said on the night in question, Soldiers Memorial Hospital's inpatient units were fully staffed, including a doctor on-call.\nDespite the ER crunch, Varner stressed anyone who needs emergency care should come. As always, patients who need resuscitation will be seen first.\n\"Please be patient because we will see you, we will provide high quality care, but it may take longer,\" she said.\nDr. Catherine Varner said ER providers strive to provide high-quality care to all patients, despite the waits. \n \n(Submitted by Catherine Varner)",

        "content": "Seniors at risk of dementia who were given hearing aids and counselling had less cognitive decline over a three-year period, a randomized trial finds.\nResearch \npublished Monday in The Lancet medical journal\n found that at-risk seniors saw their rate of cognitive decline nearly cut in half over three years if they wore hearing aids,\u00a0compared to seniors who just received education.\u00a0\nWhile past research \nhas shown a link\n between hearing loss and cognitive decline, experts say this study supports the need for seniors to use devices to mitigate the risk.\nIn Canada, audiologists \nestimate\n that around three million people have some degree of hearing loss that could be improved with hearing aids, yet 80 per cent don't wear them.\n\"It's a testament that hearing intervention, it's not just improving your hearing;\u00a0there are a lot of cascading effects that we see now,\" said the study's co-principal investigator Dr. Frank Lin.\u00a0\nCBC Explains\nWhat over-the-counter hearing aids in the U.S. could mean for Canada\nLin, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, says the study shows that good hearing \"decreases loneliness, improves your social engagement, you become more active [and] it might take a load off your brain.\"\u00a0\nThe randomized control trial involved 977 participants, who were about 77 years old on average.\u00a0\nDr. Frank Lin is the study's lead author and a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n \n(Submitted by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine)\nSome people were considered healthy, while others had underlying conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, which put them at a greater risk for cognitive decline.\u00a0\nParticipants were randomly divided into two groups: one that got hearing aids with additional counselling and another that only took part in a successful aging health education class.\u00a0\nOver three years, researchers measured the level of cognitive decline between the two groups.\u00a0\nThere was no significant difference in cognition between the two groups overall, nor was there a notable difference for the healthy participants across both groups.\nBut when researchers looked at the\u00a0results\u00a0for just\u00a0the participants who were at higher risk of dementia, those who got hearing aids slowed their cognitive decline by 48 per cent over the study period.\nHow is hearing tied to dementia?\u00a0\nAccording to Lin, researchers suspect that there are three major ways hearing loss can impact the brain.\u00a0\nThe first, he said, is related to cognitive load, which means that there's excessive work being done by the brain to compensate for poor hearing.\u00a0\n\"Your brain is constantly getting a much more garbled signal from the ear,\" he said.\u00a0\"And we understand now that likely takes a toll on the brain.\"\u00a0\nMarilyn Reed is an audiology practice adviser at Baycrest Centre in Toronto.\u00a0She says the research findings weren't surprising, but do provide more robust support for the link between cognitive decline and hearing loss.\n \n(Jennifer La Grassa/CBC)\nThe brain is constantly reallocating resources to handle hearing as a result, and that might \"come at the expense\" of our thinking and memory, Lin said.\u00a0\nA second reason is that if the brain isn't getting enough auditory input, that can cause parts of it to shrink, said Lin.\u00a0\nAnd lastly, hearing loss can cause someone to withdraw and not be as socially engaged. This is also thought to contribute to brain atrophy.\u00a0\n\"The thing with hearing intervention [is that] it likely targets all those pathways:\u00a0it reduces load on the brain, provides more stimulation to the brain,\u00a0[and] at the same time, it helps you be more engaged with your life,\" said Lin.\u00a0\nStudy limits confounding factors\nWhile these study results aren't surprising to those in the industry, the methods used provide more robust support for the idea that hearing loss is tied to cognitive function.\u00a0\nThere's been a lot of research recently that shows hearing loss can be an early warning sign for potential decline, said\u00a0Kathy Pichora-Fuller, a professor emeritus in psychology at the University of Toronto not involved in the study.\nBut what stands out to the gerontologist and audiologist is that there weren't as many confounding factors due to the fact that participants were randomly assigned to either group.\u00a0\nThis would mean that lifestyle factors were relatively the same between the control and intervention groups.\u00a0\nTypically in studies done with hearing aids, Pichora-Fuller said they compare people who have them with those who don't.\u00a0\nReed is shown speaking with a patient who wears a hearing aid. Reed says routine hearing screening should be done for people 50 and older by primary-care doctors in order to better educate people and provide earlier intervention.\n \n(Jennifer La Grassa/CBC)\nBut Pichora-Fuller says people who already own hearing aids are often different: they may be more motivated, socially engaged, wealthier or have a higher education. All of these factors could be what helps preserve their mental state as they age.\u00a0\n\"Now we can compare apples to apples,\" she said about the new study.\u00a0\nShe says it's also important to know that the participants in this study were not only given hearing aids, but also engaged in continuous audio rehabilitation with an expert.\u00a0\nBarriers to getting hearing aids\nEven though the benefits of hearing aids have been clear for some time, those who work in the industry say patients are still reluctant to get them.\u00a0\n\"Hearing aids do have a stigma associated with them and it's very long-standing,\" said Marilyn Reed, an audiology practice advisor at Baycrest Centre in Toronto.\u00a0\n\"The way to overcome stigma is to really talk about the problem.\"\nManitobans call on province to help cover 'astronomical' hearing aid costs for people under 65\nThis starts with family doctors, Reed said.\u00a0Regular screening in people 50 and older in primary care, she said, can reduce shame, educate people and allow for earlier intervention.\u00a0\nAnother barrier is cost, said Reed: The most basic hearing aids available in Canada start at around $2,000 a pair.\nMost recently, the U.S. approved over-the-counter hearing aids, which has dramatically reduced the price. \nMany expect Canada will soon follow suit.\nAs for next steps with this research, Lin says they are going to continue to follow the people who started off healthy to track if they eventually see any benefit from the hearing aids.\u00a0\nHe says they also plan to do more research on whether there are long-term cognitive benefits with hearing aids and their ability to reduce rates of dementia.",

        "content": "A recent \nstudy\n\u00a0found a gender pay gap in Canada's reproductive health-care system.\nDoctors in eight provinces who perform genitourinary (reproductive and urologic) procedures on female patients are paid 28 per cent less on an average than those who do similar surgeries on male patients.\nSaskatchewan has the largest discrepancy of the eight provinces, at 67 per cent, followed by B.C. at 61 per cent and Yukon at 41 per cent.\nJoanne Sivertson, the provincial department head for Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB-GYN) in Saskatchewan, said the numbers are disappointing,\u00a0even though she is desensitized to gender disparities.\u00a0\n\"It is demeaning, It is demeaning to women,\" she said.\nAs part of the study, which was published in the Canadian Journal of Surgery\u00a0on July 4, researchers looked at similar procedures done on both male and female reproductive organs. For example, surgeons get paid more for doing a biopsy of male genitalia versus female genitalia, even though it is essentially\u00a0the same procedure.\nMichael Chaikof, one of the authors of the study and an\u00a0OB-GYN and urogynecologist at Sunnybrook in Toronto,\u00a0called it\u00a0double discrimination.\u00a0\n\"Not only are women surgeons paid less on average, but surgeons who look after women are also paid less,\" Chaikof said. \"If you look at our field of gynecology \u2026 the majority of surgeons in our specialty are women.\"\u00a0\nSivertson said\u00a0this discrimination stems from historical policies. Care for women has been undervalued for decades and pay increases are done by percentage, she said. Policymakers continue to perpetuate that under evaluation and it will take a large correction to get on par with care for men, Siverston said.\nJoanne Sivertson, left, is the provincial head for obstetrics and gynecology in Saskatchewan. Michael Chaikof, right, is the lead researcher on the recent study that found doctors are paid less for reproductive procedures on women. \n \n(Submitted by Joanne Sivertson/Michael Chaikof)\nSivertson said that when she was a medical student, a male OBGYN who was her teacher made a comment that still makes her feel outraged.\n\"He said it was a tragedy that only women were entering obstetrics and gynecology, because the profession would lose all credibility.\"\nShe said that it is unacceptable that such attitudes prevail to this day.\nIn some cases, a similar procedure will be more difficult or dangerous on a woman, but still pay less.\u00a0Sivertson mentioned a procedure where an ovary or a testicle twists on itself and needs to be untwisted.\n\"To untwist an ovary you have to go into the abdominal cavity, so it's a much more risky surgery and more complex surgery, and it is paid at 50 per cent less than what untwisting a testicle will pay.\"\nSivertson said that recognizing these disparities is the first step toward\u00a0fixing them. She wants to see more resources put into women's care.\n\"We continue to struggle to provide basic women's health services in the province,\" she said.\u00a0 \u00a0\nB.C. woman says doctor shortage, anti-Indigenous bias may be why doctors missed her cancer\nChaikof\u00a0said he hopes the study will push provincial medical associations to look at their fee schedules through a gender equity lens, and empower surgeons to go to governments and advocate for gender equality.\u00a0\nSaskatchewan Medical Association (SMA) president Dr. Annette Epp\u00a0said that once the fee for\u00a0a procedure is set at a low rate, it is hard for it to catch up.\n\"\nIt is unfortunate and certainly not acceptable that Saskatchewan is lagging the most in this country. But in terms of how the fee structures happen,\u00a0it is quite a complicated process,\" Epp said.\u00a0\nShe said that the SMA\u00a0plans to\u00a0address the issue and discuss\u00a0the disparity through a lens of gender equality.\u00a0\n\"I would say that it sends a message that perhaps women's health isn't as valued and that needs to change,\" Epp said. \"I think as a society and as a profession, we have to recognize that there are disparities in outcomes between women and men, and that needs to be corrected.\"\nThe Saskatchewan Ministry of Health sent CBC a statement in response to an interview request.\n\"Physicians directly bill the government for each insured service they provide (e.g. physical exam, surgery, immunization) in accordance with the approved payment schedule,\" the ministry statement said.\n\"The ministry and the Saskatchewan Medical Association are working toward\u00a0modernization of the payment schedule to ensure consistent, equitable, and appropriate payments to practitioners for the provision of insured health services.\"\u00a0",

On one day preceding the declaration there were no ambulances available for almost three hours as 26 paramedic teams were delayed at hospitals.\nThere has been some improvement since then, Krauter said. In October there were a total of 629 minutes during which no ambulance was available. In May that total was 173 minutes.

Normally, paramedics are funded 50-50 by the province and municipalities, but Sutcliffe argues offload delays are a provincial responsibility.\nLast year, Ottawa's paramedic service spent 93,686 hours in offload delays. In Toronto, that number was about 300,000 hours, according to a paramedic services report.\nTheir mother died after an ambulance delay, but it's taken 20 years for change\nIn Waterloo Region, the amount of time no ambulances were available increased by 571 per cent from 2021 to 2022.\nOffload delays are a factor, as are an increase in call volumes and paramedic staff shortages, said John Riches, chief of paramedic services.\nThe region has increased ambulance resources and 2023 is so far looking a little better, he said, but it's \"not significant enough to celebrate.\"\nWaterloo Region paramedics and its three area hospitals are hoping to introduce a \"fit to sit\" program this fall, in which paramedics can leave certain stable patients to wait in the ER, he said.\nWaterloo region considers more resources for paramedic services to meet demand\nHospitals in Durham Region have such a program, and that along with additional offload nurse funding has helped dramatically ease offload delays and code zeros, said paramedic services chief Troy Cheseboro.\nOver the past couple of years it wasn't uncommon to have offload delays of four hours, and now most are under 60 or 90 minutes, Cheseboro said.\nCity seeks to triple new paramedic hires as ambulance demand soars\n\"We're seeing huge, huge changes with the work the hospital has done to try to mitigate some of these added pressures,\" he said.\nCheseboro said Durham has also seen great success with the community paramedicine program, which sees them provide in-home care and outreach to frequent callers and those who need help with chronic disease management.

But as those instruments join a pile of medical waste in an industry already heavy with single-use items, one U.K. centre is pivoting to reusing them.\nThe Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton is one of the first emergency departments in the U.K. to pilot using reusable suture instruments to better the service's carbon footprint.\n\"We cannot talk about planetary health without embedding certain principles into everything that we do \u2014 and health care is no exception,\" said Dr. Mahmood Bhutta, the clinical green lead at University Hospitals Sussex who instigated the project.\nThe pilot program, which started in January, removes from rotation single-use suture kits designed for stitching wounds. These kits \u2014 comprised of scissors, needle holds and forceps \u2014 are usually put into a sharps bin immediately after use and incinerated.\nThe instruments in the reusable kits are instead now sterilized on site and stored in specialized boxes to protect their 15-year lifespan.\nThe hospital estimates that switching to reusable suture instruments will save at least 2,240 kits from incineration every year and eliminate one kilogram of carbon per use.\n\"We absolutely have to reuse what we can \u2014 it's part of future health care,\" said Bhutta.\nSurgical scissors are one piece of equipment the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, England, is reusing. These measures support an attempt to reduce the hospital's carbon footprint by 57 per cent by 2025.\n \n(Mahmood Bhutta/University Hospitals Sussex )\nThe health-care industry has been long reliant on plastic and single-use materials, like masks, gloves, gowns, tubing, medication packaging and more. But with growing concerns over the environmental impact and climbing health-care costs, a shift to reusable instruments can address some of these pressing challenges.\u00a0\nAccording to a 2019 \nreport\n by Health Care Without Harm, the sector is responsible for an estimated 4.4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, with an overall climate footprint equivalent to the annual GHGs of 514 coal-fired power plants.\nIf the health sector were a country, the report said, it would be the fifth-largest emitter on the planet.\nNet-zero pledge from the U.K. NHS\nFor the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS), its providers produce approximately 156,000 tonnes of clinical waste \nevery year\n that is either sent for incineration or alternative treatment \u2014 the equivalent to more than 400 jumbo jets loaded with waste.\nIn 2020, \nthe NHS\n laid out a roadmap to become the first net-zero health service in the world by 2045.\nReusing equipment that is safe to do so, such as suture kits or some personal protective equipment (PPE), can significantly lessen the sector's overall impact on climate change, says Bhutta.\nWATCH |\u00a0How\u00a0changes in the operating room could go a long way to help the planet:\n\u00a0\nThe anesthetic gasses hurting the environment from operating rooms\n4 years ago\nDuration \n3:04\nThe health-care industry in North America has a pollution problem. One study showed it generates more than eight per cent of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. But a few changes in the operating room could go a long way in helping the planet.\nOn average, switching from single-use to reusable health-care products can reduce the global warming potential by between 38 to 50 per cent, according to \na 2023 study published\n in the European Journal of Public Health.\nWhile the thought may make some patients uneasy, all instruments reused in the program meet stringent sterilization requirements, said Dr. Chantelle Rizan, a clinical lecturer and researcher in sustainable health care.\u00a0\nThat means there is no increased risk of infection for patients when it comes to recycling the medical equipment.\u00a0\n\"We wouldn't do it if it wasn't safe for our patients,\" she said.\nThere are also some instruments that hospitals will likely never be able to reuse \u2014 needles, for example.\nWhat's the process like?\nAt the Royal Sussex, once a pair of surgical scissors from a kit are used, they are returned to the sterile services department within the hospital, Rizan explained. The scissors are then washed and any physical debris or contaminants removed, typically using water and detergent.\u00a0\nThen they are repackaged in sterile housing material \u2014\u00a0special packaging that is tightly sealed, allowing the rest of the sterilization process to safely take place.\nWhy hospitals are beginning to reuse or recycle oxygen masks, IV bags, surgical tools they used to throw out\nThe next step is steam sterilization, followed by final tests to ensure the assurance standards are met.\u00a0\nAlthough the process is lengthy and requires some more resources, Bhutta says reusing instruments will end up saving money in the long run.\n\"I think what's really going to drive it, if I'm honest, is the financial savings we're seeing,\" he said.\nWax hooks, used to remove foreign objects from the ear, are another piece of equipment that is being reused at the U.K hospital to lessen its environmental impact.\n \n(Mahmood Bhutta/University Hospitals Sussex)\nAfter one department of the Sussex hospital started using reusable tourniquets, the hospital has saved around 80,000 pounds \u2014 about $136,000 Cdn \u2014 every year, he said.\n\"So if nothing else, [with single-use instruments], we throw away money, as well as materials, as well as [create] carbon.\"\nSwap your inhaler, skip the laughing gas: How patients can help curb health-care emissions\nAnother program at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, England, has been reusing other medical equipment in their emergency department, such as gowns, drapes and scrub caps.\u00a0\nSiya Lodhia, a clinical research fellow, organized the nine-month program there in April to see how hospital staff would react to a push to green the department.\u00a0\n\"The whole attitude around it is positive so far,\" she said. \"They had questions about the safety of it; so just all the little things that they were worried about, the timing of having to do everything and the change. But I mean, people are jumping on board.\"\n'Throwaway culture'\nAs the program reaches its halfway point next month, Lodhia said she will check in to see how the staff are continuing to fare with the change. She predicts that some staff might be having a hard time adjusting after having a long-established way of working.\u00a0\nThe potential for a rocky transition from single-use to reusable equipment for staff could be a reason why hospitals might not be eager to make the switch, said Bhutta.\n\"We've become so used to a throwaway culture,\" he said. \"We even found in our department, the mentality is we just throw everything away.\n\"That's completely normal practice, absolute madness.\"\nA trash can loaded with medical waste is seen at the Hospital General de Mexico, in Mexico City, in this 2020 file photo. The health-care industry has long been reliant on plastic and single-use items.\n \n(Hector Vivas/Getty Images)\nAnother obstacle is a lack of infrastructure to support the sterilization process, he said, as it can be considered \"inconvenient\" in often-busy emergency rooms.\nThe regulations for new, reusable instruments to be used in the health-care system can also be hard to meet, noted Bhutta.\n\"If they want to change even one small piece of packaging around a product to make it smaller, they have to go through an entire regulatory process,\" he said. \"I'm afraid it just seems to be paperwork for the sake of paperwork.\"\nA trend around the world\nWhile industrialized countries like Canada and the U.K. are often at the forefront of reusing medical instruments in hospitals, the real front-runners are the countries that are doing so out of necessity, Bhutta said.\n\"We should be looking to lower-resource countries, such as India and Cambodia and parts of Africa, where they reuse all the equipment naturally. They do complex surgical operations safely, with much lower carbon and financial costs, out of necessity,\" he said. \"But also because that's actually the right thing to do.\"\nOrder to clean up 17 sea cans full of medical waste highlights Alberta's biomedical trash troubles\nIn one \nstudy\n looking at more than two million cataract operations performed in India, predominantly using reusable equipment, the rates of infectious endophthalmitis, a common infection after the procedure, were significantly lower than those reported in the U.K., where single-use products are routinely used.\u00a0\nWhile it might take some time for hospitals to adapt to reusable equipment, Bhatta says he's hopeful for change.\n\"I'm still optimistic. I think we need a real investment in both physical and human resources to enable these sorts of changes. But, of course, it can be done.\"\nClimate change has broad effects on health-care systems, medical journal says",

Japan has reopened its doors to \nCanadian imports\n, and Ottawa plans to open a new Indo-Pacific Agriculture and Agri-Food office in \nManila, the capital of the Philippines\n.\n\"The world is looking for Canadian beef, [and] we know that we have a tremendous great story to tell,\" Drouin\u00a0said.\nHow much does sustainability matter?\u00a0\nBack at home, though, it's not clear if consumers'\u00a0perception of beef and sustainability will make much of a difference to the industry's bottom line.\nKevin Grier, a livestock and meat market analyst based in Guelph, Ont., said while consumers may say environmental issues matter to them, taste and price tend to beat out those concerns when it comes to choices at the grocery store.\nBoth grass-fed and grain-fed beef production are more carbon-intensive than pork production, according to a research report prepared in 2021 for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.\n \n(Monica Kidd)\nDespite \nrising rates of vegetarianism\n, Statistics Canada data shows that Canadians' demand for beef has remained \"very, very strong,\" tempered only slightly by high prices, he said.\nThose prices are expected to continue to move higher as western Canadian beef producers deal with drought conditions and some ranchers \ncull their herds\n. Fresh and frozen beef prices \nrose nine\u00a0per cent in the past year\n, outpacing other protein sources.\n\"That's the issue I think that's interesting, is what role beef is going to play in the meat case in the next couple of years,\" Grier\u00a0said.\nThere are fewer cows around and that's partly why your beef is so expensive\nNature Conservancy of Canada touts plan to protect 5,000 square km of Prairie grasslands\nAs for Ryder Lee, the CCA's general manager, he said\u00a0talking about sustainability has become a priority whether it translates to sales or not.\n\"Public opinion builds up over time,\" he said. \"If we just stick to our knitting and raise cattle and don't talk about what we're doing, what we've found is decisions get made for us.\nAbout\u00a017 Alberta schools have so far registered to use the\u00a0\nGuardians\n\u00a0computer game. The organization hopes to offer versions tailored toward\u00a0other provinces so they can be used in classrooms \nacross the country\n this fall.",

        "content": "Astronomers reported Wednesday the discovery of what could be two planets sharing the same orbit around their star.\nThey said it's the strongest evidence yet of this bizarre cosmic pairing, long suspected but never proven.\nUsing a telescope in Chile, the Spanish-led team spotted a cloud of debris in the same orbit as an already confirmed planet circling this star, 370 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus. They suspect it's either a planet in formation or remnants of a planet that once was.\nAsteroids are known to accompany planets around their star \u2014 for example, Jupiter and its so-called Trojan asteroids. But planets in the same orbit \"have so far been like unicorns,\" noted study co-author Jorge Lillo-Box of Madrid's Center for Astrobiology.\n\"They are allowed to exist by theory, but no one has ever detected them,\" he said in a statement.\nThis chart shows the southern constellation of Centaurus and marks most of the stars visible to the unaided eye on a clear dark night. \u00a0The dwarf star PDS 70 is marked with a red circle.\n \n(ESO, IAU and Sky & Telescope)\nThe scientists said they will need to wait until 2026 in order to properly track the two objects around the star known as PDS 70.\nThe confirmed planet with the suspected tagalong takes 119 years to complete a lap.

        "content": "New research using the latest figures for Canada's methane emissions concludes it would be much cheaper for the energy industry to meet reduction targets for the potent greenhouse gas than it would be to pay carbon taxes on it.\n\"The federal government's target for 75 per cent reduction is achievable,\" said Kris Chapman of Dunsky Energy and Climate Advisors, a Montreal-based consultancy hired by the environmental group Environmental Defence.\nChapman said Canada's oil and gas industry could meet Ottawa's goal of a 75 per cent reduction in methane emissions by 2030 for the equivalent of about $11 per tonne of carbon.\nThe current federal carbon tax is $65 a tonne, although methane is shielded from that tax under some provincial climate change regimes.\nAfter leading the world on cutting methane, Canada faces stringent new standards in U.S. and Europe\nCanada will soon end 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies. But what does that mean?\nThose calculations are based on recent studies that suggest official figures for methane release are significant underestimates. A series of published papers has concluded the methane releases inventoried by the federal government from industry reports are far too low.\nThose concerns are echoed in a report this year from the auditor general's office.\n\"Several Canadian scientific studies suggest that total emissions are under-reported in the national inventory and that the distribution of emissions is likely inaccurate,\" it says.\nChapman said the Dunsky paper multiplies methane emissions in Canada's national inventory by 1.7 to achieve a more likely estimate of what's actually being released into the atmosphere.\n\"We're pretty confident that 1.7 is representative of reality.\"\nOilsands emissions 65% higher than tallied by current measuring methods, study suggests\nCarbon rules key to Irving Oil's new clean-energy deal, says gas partner\nDunsky's cost estimate is close to that of the International Energy Agency. Earlier this year, that body estimated that methane equivalent to about 30,000 tonnes of carbon could be eliminated from the Canadian oilpatch \u2014 roughly what it would take to meet the federal goal \u2014 for $13 a tonne or less.\nAs well, the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based clean-energy think tank, released a 2021 report concluding Canada could reduce methane emissions by 80 per cent from 2012 levels for less than $25 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent.\nA call for strict standards\nThe Dunsky paper comes as the federal government prepares a new set of regulations for methane, a greenhouse gas up to 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Its conclusions should encourage Ottawa to set strict standards, said Ari Pottens of Environmental Defence.\n\"We're looking for the regulations to be as ambitious as the proposed framework was,\" he said.\nEnvironmental Defence wants the rules to ban venting and flaring of methane from oil and gas sites. It wants regular and frequent inspections to ensure compliance and bans on certain types of equipment prone to leak.\nThe Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Dunsky report.\nHowever, industry has committed to reducing emissions by 45 per cent by 2025. Alberta's 2021 progress report found methane releases from oil and gas fell about 44 per cent between 2014 and 2021, although that figure is based on official emission estimates.\n \nIf we're able to cut back on methane emissions now, we're actually buying ourselves time later to address some of the tougher climate issues.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n- Ari Pottens\nPottens said it makes sense for government and industry to go hard after methane.\nThe effort is cost-effective, he said, and can result in a more saleable product for natural gas producers. But because methane affects climate so strongly at first and then gradually fades, tackling it presents an opportunity.\n\"If we're able to cut back on methane emissions now, we're actually buying ourselves time later to address some of the tougher climate issues.\"",

Repenomamus\u00a0shows that at least some mammals gave as good as they got.\n\"I think what's key here is that Mesozoic food webs were\u00a0more complex than we had imagined,\" Mallon said.\nThe area in Liaoning Province where the virtually complete\u00a0fossil was found is called the \"Chinese Pompeii,\" owing to\u00a0various fossils of animals buried in volcanic eruptions.\nThis is the hillside where the fossil was collected from the Lujiatun Member of the Yixian Formation of northeastern China in 2012. It's known as 'China's dinosaur Pompeii' because of the volcanic eruption that beautifully preserved the fossils.\n \n(Gang Han)\nExamining the fossil was like a crime scene analysis.\u00a0Repenomamus is perched atop the prone Psittacosaurus, gripping\u00a0the jaw and hind leg while biting into the ribcage. Repenomamus measures 47 centimetres (18 inches)\u00a0long.\u00a0Psittacosaurus is 120 centimetres\u00a0(four feet)\u00a0long. Both are thought to be not quite full adults.\n\"There have been specimens of carnivorous dinosaurs preying\u00a0on plant-eating dinosaurs before, but there has never been an\u00a0example of a mammal preying on a dinosaur,\" said Canadian Museum\u00a0of Nature paleontologist and study co-author Xiao-Chun Wu.\nPreserved\u00a0in battle\nIt is rare to find fossils showing animals interacting.\u00a0Another fossil found in the 1970s in Mongolia shows two\u00a0dinosaurs \u2014\u00a0predator Velociraptor and plant-eater Protoceratops\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fighting about 80 million years ago before being buried alive,\u00a0perhaps in a collapsing sand dune.\nThe researchers discounted the idea that the Repenomamus and\u00a0Psittacosaurus fossil showed a mammal merely scavenging a\u00a0carcass.\nThe fossil preserves the entangled skeletons of Psittacosaurus, a horned dinosaur, and the badger-like mammal Repenomamus. Magnified sections show the mammal biting the dinosaur's ribs and gripping its prey. Scale bar equals 10 centimetres.\n \n(Gang Han)\n\"For one, the mammal is on top of the dinosaur as though it\u00a0was trying to subdue it, which the scavenging hypothesis doesn't\u00a0account for,\" Mallon said.\n\"Second, there are no bite marks on the bones of the\u00a0dinosaur, which we would expect if it had been sitting out for\u00a0long, exposed to scavengers. Lastly, the hind foot of the mammal\u00a0is trapped by the folded hind leg of the dinosaur, which is\u00a0unlikely to have happened if the dinosaur had already been dead\u00a0when the mammal came across it,\" he said.\nRare ancient baby turtle identified inside fossil egg\nOriginal Jurassic Park set local researcher on palaeobiological path\nWhile Psittacosaurus was an early relative of the horned\u00a0dinosaur lineage, it lacked facial horns and a head crest. It\u00a0possessed a parrot-like beak to crop plant material.\nRepenomamus, one of the dinosaur age's largest mammals, had\u00a0short and sprawling limbs, a long tail, a sinuous body, a robust\u00a0skull and shearing teeth. Mallon compared its appearance to the\u00a0living Chinese ferret-badger.\nAn illustration shows the badger-like mammal Repenomamus robustus as it attacks a horned dinosaur, Psittacosaurus lujiatunensis, moments before a volcanic debris flow buries them both, about 125 million years ago.\n \n(Michael Skrepnick)\nThere was previous evidence of the dino-eating habits of\u00a0Repenomamus. One Repenomamus fossil from the same area had baby\u00a0Psittacosaurus bones in its stomach.\n\"What's unique about our fossil is the fact that it\u00a0demonstrates that Repenomamus was capable of tackling larger\u00a0dinosaur prey,\" Mallon said.",

CBC News goes inside Toronto\u2019s Scarborough Health Network to see the impact.\nFederal officials remain 'committed to a review'\nFederal officials told CBC News they remain \"committed to a review of the response to COVID-19 in order to take stock of lessons learned and to better inform preparations and responses to future health emergencies,\" according to a statement provided by the office of Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos.\nHealth Canada also noted there are a number of audits and studies already underway, including the launch of an independent public health review panel and a series of comprehensive audits on the agency's pandemic response undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General.\nAnalysis\nCanada needs a pandemic post-mortem \u2014 now, not later\n\"But they're not comprehensive,\" Clark, from the BMJ, said in a video call with CBC News. \"They almost seem to exist as a patchwork quilt.\"\nThe country's previous health minister, Patty Hajdu, spoke about the possibility of a broader approach back in 2021.\n\"We are open to an inquiry that is as deep as necessary, including a public inquiry, that gets to how our country can be better prepared [for] global health threats in the future,\" Hajdu said in April that year, adding the government would consider examining its COVID response \"when the time is right.\"\nCitizen-led inquiry into Canada's pandemic response makes stop in Winnipeg\nThat time is now, Clark said. \"What we need is something at the federal level that's properly legislated and governed,\" she continued, \"so that we're doing a full comprehensive public inquiry that looks at the full pandemic response.\"\nDr. David Naylor, whose 234-page report on the SARS crisis of 2003 outlined \"squabbling among jurisdictions\" and \"dysfunctional relationships among public health officials\" \u2014 and led to the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada a year later \u2014 agreed some form of analysis is warranted.\u00a0\nPeople wait in line at a COVID-19 testing facility is in Burnaby, B.C., on Aug. 12, 2020. \n \n(Ben Nelms/CBC)\nThe U.K. has already launched a COVID inquiry\n, including six weeks of hearings, a style which Naylor warned runs the risk of becoming a \"drawn-out affair with a focus on finger-pointing and lots of political theatre.\"\nWhat makes more sense, he said in an email to CBC News, is a multidisciplinary review panel including both experts and Canadians from other walks of life, and chaired by an independent, international voice.\n\"The least our leaders can do is honour the memories of those we lost, and the sacrifices and commitments of those still living, by giving Canadians a comprehensive and honest account of what went wrong, what went right, and what will be done to ensure that we are better prepared for the next infectious threat,\" he wrote.\nTo fill that void, Clark and other authors offered their own assessments.\u00a0\nOn the positive side, \nresearch suggests\n the country fared well in the first two years, with lower SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths, coupled with higher vaccination coverage, than most other industrialized G10 countries, the authors wrote.\nBut their list of shortcomings in Canada's pandemic response was far longer.\u00a0\nA COVID-19 vaccination clinic at the Vancouver Convention Centre is pictured in Vancouver on Jan. 13, 2022.\n \n(Ben Nelms/CBC)\nEfforts to contain COVID were hampered by inconsistency in decision making and inadequate data sharing, one BMJ paper noted, while another highlighted early funding gaps that neglected\u00a0outbreak hotspots such as long-term care, housing shelters, and essential workplaces.\nCommunities with low incomes, immigrants, essential workers hardest hit by COVID-19: study\n\"The picture that emerges is an ill prepared country with outdated data systems, poor coordination and cohesion, and blindness about its citizens' diverse needs. What saved Canada was a largely willing and conforming populace that withstood stringent public health measures and achieved among the world's highest levels of vaccination coverage,\" the BMJ authors wrote in their opening editorial.\n\"In other words, Canadians delivered on the pandemic response while its governments faltered.\"\n'We weren't closing the gaps'\nThe latest available federal data\n shows more than nine in 10 reported COVID deaths throughout the pandemic were among Canadians aged 60 and up, with the highest death toll among seniors over the age of 80.\nLong-term care, in particular, became a death trap, in what the BMJ team called a \"predictable\" crisis.\n\"A particular disgrace is Canada being at the top of wealthy nations for [COVID-related] deaths in care homes for older people, despite more than 100 reports foreshadowing a nursing home crisis,\" the authors wrote.\nAnalysis\nIn 2003, Canada failed the pandemic test. Here's what we've learned since\nResidents of care homes accounted for three per cent of COVID cases in Canada by the end of 2021, but made up roughly 43 per cent of deaths. And even though long-term care residents were prioritized in the country's vaccination programs, homes experienced more outbreaks in 2022 than in either of the previous years of the pandemic.\u00a0\nWinnipeg resident Eddie Calisto-Tavares, whose father died during a COVID outbreak at a long-term care home, described the scene inside the home in the days before her father's death as a \"nightmare,\" with residents calling for help, few staff left to check on them, and people eventually being found dead by paramedics.\u00a0Her fear now, she said, is that history will repeat itself should another crisis hit.\nWATCH | Canada's COVID-19 response lacked coordination, reports say:\u00a0\nCanada needs a national inquiry into COVID failures, experts say\n1 day ago\nDuration \n2:42\nA series of new reports in the British Medical Journal say Canada was 'ill-prepared' and 'lacked coordination' in the COVID-19 pandemic. The report authors say it is time to investigate what happened and learn how to prepare for the next pandemic.\n\"When you don't learn from your mistakes, you're doomed to repeat them,\" echoed Toronto geriatrician Dr. Samir Sinha, who was not involved in the BMJ series. Long-term care homes still have major staffing issues, he added, while rooms are still being built to house more than one resident at a time despite the risks of virus transmission.\n\"While we felt bad for older Canadians, we didn't always learn to step up and do what we knew we could have done,\" Sinha said.\nLiberal MPs call for national standards for long-term care homes\nThe BMJ authors also stressed that, overall, the highest rates of SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths were among racialized groups, recent immigrants, lower-wage essential workers, and individuals living in crowded, multigenerational households.\nThe latest Ontario data paints a particularly stark picture: The income gap in COVID-19 outcomes didn't improve over time, with an updated analysis led by a Toronto research team showing rates of hospital admissions and deaths remained threefold higher in the lowest versus highest income neighbourhoods \u2014 through seven waves of infections up to the fall of 2022.\nThat trend played out even as the province ramped up vaccine coverage, several authors continued, and while the population developed more hybrid protection through prior infections and vaccination.\u00a0\nCOVID-19 variants spreading faster in GTA areas with more low-income residents, essential workers: study\n\"We weren't closing the gaps, and by then, really we should have,\" said\u00a0Dr. Sharmistha Mishra, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Toronto and Unity Health.\nGovernments still need to push for workplace improvements to address those systemic issues, she argued, including adequate sick days, strategies to reach communities with lower incomes and higher population densities, and ensuring vaccine equity.\u00a0\nThe country also experienced multiple large, often deadly outbreaks among essential workers, including \nhundreds of infections at one Brampton, Ont., Amazon warehouse\n in 2021 and one of the continent's largest outbreaks \nat an Alberta meat-packing plant\n\u00a0the year before, which was linked to more than 1,500 cases and at least two deaths.\nConcerns over vaccine hoarding, distribution\u00a0\nVaccination approaches in Canada were a mixed bag, with the country hitting high overall vaccination targets \u2014 eight in 10 Canadians have finished their initial vaccine series \u2014 \nwhile critics warned shots weren't always making it to the hardest-hit communities throughout the pandemic\n.\u00a0\nThe BMJ team praised some provinces' efforts to develop hot-spot vaccination strategies, but said advisory group reports often came out too late. The first federal report on COVID inequalities, the authors noted, came out 10 months into the pandemic.\u00a0\nCanada falling behind on promised vaccine donations to other countries\nThe researchers also dug into Canada's role to deliver vaccines on the global stage, including the federal government's heavily criticized decision to receive doses from the global initiative known as COVAX while also gobbling up shots through other outside deals.\nA nurse attends to a COVID-19 positive patient in Toronto's Humber River Hospital intensive care unit on Jan. 13, 2022.\n \n(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\"By the end of 2022, Canada had administered almost 96 million doses while delivering fewer than 29 million abroad. This poor performance on sharing doses when they were most needed resulted in domestic oversupply, with tens of millions facing expiry by late 2022,\" outlined one BMJ paper.\n\"Meanwhile, over two years after vaccination began in Canada, not a single dose had been manufactured domestically, a shortcoming that directly affected the government's actions both at home and abroad regarding measures to increase vaccine supply.\"\nCBC Investigates\nOntario's pharmacy vaccines harder to find in some areas with high COVID rates\nBy making extensive bilateral deals with drug companies, Canada and other high-income countries claimed most of the available vaccines and pushed COVAX \u2014 and by extension low- and middle-income countries \u2014 to the back of the queue for receiving vaccines, the paper continued.\n\"A million lives in 2021 alone might have been saved in poorer countries had rich nations such as Canada shared more [doses],\" the\u00a0authors wrote.\nIt all played out against what the BMJ team described as a health-care system that remains fragmented, decentralized, and complex \u2014 which provided \"different rules in different places\" throughout the pandemic based on unclear rationale.\u00a0\nWhile federal bodies offered vaccination guidance, each province or territory then created separate eligibility plans and mandates. \"For example, vaccine mandates in Ontario applied only to those working in long term care homes while in New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Yukon vaccines were required for those working in healthcare, the public sector, long term care, and schools,\" one analysis noted.\nStress and fear in the factories: The toll taken by COVID-19 inside some busy Alberta workplaces\nProvincial public health authorities also differed in their guidance on masks, school closures, curfews and lockdowns, while various levels of government tackled outbreak management.\u00a0\n\"The authors are very concerned that some of their findings \u2014 about missed opportunities for leadership or coordination, and a lack of sharing of data across systems \u2014 that these were some of the flaws that were identified during the Canadian response to the SARS outbreak,\" Clark told CBC News, referring to Naylor's 2003 report.\nWATCH | Inside meat-packing plants ravaged by COVID-19:\n \nInside two meat plants scarred by COVID-19\n2 years ago\nDuration \n8:55\nA COVID-19 outbreak at an Alberta slaughterhouse claimed three lives. A year later, at another plant, it happened again. Find out why as CBC speaks to affected workers, who we have agreed to not name as they fear it could impact their jobs.\n'This is going to require transformative change'\nThroughout the BMJ papers, and in CBC News conversations with outside medical experts, a central theme that emerged was a desire for this country to avoid the mistakes of the last few years \u2014 though few seemed hopeful.\n\"If we were to have another pandemic that would start tomorrow,\" Sinha said, \"it would really be Groundhog Day again.\"\nDr. Sharon Straus, physician-in-chief at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and one of the main authors of several papers in the BMJ series, warned that without a full federal inquiry, various political actors may step into that vacuum and create more divisiveness across the country.\u00a0\nWhat the BMJ authors want to see, she added, is an inquiry that actually gets implemented, including new national standards that could reduce the fractured nature of Canadian healthcare and better prepare the country for the possibility of another pandemic.\n\"This is going to require transformative change,\" she said, along with \"unprecedented collaboration between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments.\"\nBut Clark acknowledged that given Canada's mixed performance during COVID \u2014 even after a scathing report on how the country handled SARS \u2014 there's a growing sense that mistakes may be repeated whenever another public health threat hits.\n\"It's really depressing that all of us expect people to shrug our shoulders when we have a crisis of this magnitude and scale,\" she said.",

Armed with a headlamp strapped to his forehead, bat researcher Aaron Aguirre rubs his gloved hands together with delight.\n\"Oh, I love this,\" he says, smile still clear from behind his black face mask. \"I love getting my hands on bats.\"\nAguirre, 29, is part of a specialized team spending the summer gathering more information about the city's urban bat population to protect the mammals \u2014 and their billion-dollar benefit to the economy \u2014 as one of the deadliest wildlife diseases in North America creeps closer to the coast.\nResearchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) are capturing bats in at least 20 city parks so they can be tracked and tested for white-nose syndrome, a deadly disease caused by a fungus that feeds on the muzzle, ears and wings of hibernating bats.\nWhite-nose syndrome detected in Kootenays\nThis summer, they need to gather baseline information so they have a starting point from which to track losses and potentially start preventative treatments should white-nose syndrome reach the city.\nThe fungus that causes white-nose syndrome was found in bat guano \u2014 or bat droppings \u2014 in B.C.'s Kootenays earlier this year.\nResearchers from the University of British Columbia set up a mesh net at Vancouver's Vanier Park to catch bats on July 11, 2023.\n \n(Gian Paolo Mendoza/CBC)\nThe condition burns up fat the bats need to make it through the winter, leaving them to starve or freeze to death. The mammals can also wake up too early because the fuzz for which the disease is named is just uncomfortable \u2014 like trying to sleep with a bad case of athlete's foot all over your nose.\nThe disease, which spreads quickly between huddled bats, can wipe out up to 98 per cent of any given bat population.\n\"It was devastating to see,\" said Canadian National White-Nose Syndrome co-ordinator Jordi Segers, recalling an outbreak that killed most of the bat population in Nova Scotia nearly a decade ago.\n\"We were literally walking on corpses as we entered the cave. There were just thousands of dead bats lying on the ground there.\"\nThe University of British Columbia's Aaron Aguirre uses a swab on a bat to take a sample to be sent off to a lab on July 11 to determine whether the bat is infected with the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome.\n \n(Gian Paolo Mendoza/CBC)\nNatural pest control worth billions\nPreserving the bat population is essential for the economy and environment in B.C. The mammals are pollinators and insect-eaters capable of devouring half their weight in bugs \u2014 including mosquitoes \u2014 in a single night. Their natural pest control saves Canada's agriculture and forestry sectors billions every year, according to Parks Canada.\nDespite their benefits, there is little research available on urban bat populations.\nAt Vanier Park, the team wears face masks and rubber gloves to avoid any chance of infecting the bats with COVID-19.\nA wild bat is pictured at Vanier Park in Vancouver on July 11.\n \n(Gian Paolo Mendoza/CBC)\nThey catch the bats with nets so fine the mesh is difficult for humans to see with the naked eye. Most of the bats in Vancouver are little brown bats \u2014 speedy, nocturnal animals that weigh about as much as a plastic credit card.\u00a0They like to roost in human-made structures, but the species is now considered endangered because of its susceptibility to white-nose syndrome.\nOnce captured, the delicate animals are measured, weighed and swabbed. They're also milked to confirm whether they're lactating females.\nBigger bats are tagged with small radio telemetry tags to follow their movement and track where they sleep during the day.\n\"I would say it's pretty urgent,\"\u00a0said Matthew Mitchell with UBC's Faculty of Land and Food Systems, referring to the research underway.\n\"Especially here where the bats and particularly the urban bats are fairly understudied, we really want to get a handle on what these populations are like, what their ecology is like, where they're spending their time before we start seeing bats with white-nose syndrome.\"\nWhite-nose syndrome first appeared in North America in 2006 in New York state, probably through shipping. It's spread mostly bat to bat, although humans can play a role by carrying spores on their clothes or gear. There is no cure for the disease, but there are preventative treatments.\n\"It's hard to predict exactly what will happen if we lose bat species. There's lots of other things going on in urban landscapes, the climate change, people changing the landscape, all of those sorts of things,\" said Mitchell.\n\"But I would also just be really sad if there weren't bats around.\"",

See how they compare to historical trends\nHumidity adds another layer of danger to heat\u00a0because when there's too much moisture in the air, sweat doesn't evaporate as easily, making it harder to cool off.\nEveryone experiences heat differently, which means hot and humid conditions are riskier for some people, especially seniors and those with certain underlying health issues like diabetes.\u00a0\nPeople who aren't used to humid heat could also be especially vulnerable to new extremes, said Kenneth Chow, a climate scientist with the Canadian Centre for Climate Services at ECCC.\n\"It's kind of novel to them,\" he said. \"If they've previously never experienced any [high humidex] days, going from zero to 30 days on average would be quite significant and \u2014 depending on their capacity to adapt \u2014 might strain and put a lot of people at risk.\"\nEven Medicine Hat, known as the sunniest city in Canada, didn't used to see many days with high humidex. Depending on greenhouse gas emissions, it could go from around two days a year with a humidex above 35\u00a0to between 13 and 51 by the end of the century, according to ECCC's projections.\nIt's a shift already felt by locals.\n\"There's been a change,\" said Brian Stauth, managing director of public services for the City of Medicine Hat.\n\"[Humidity is] certainly not something we would have thought of as Medicine Hatters a decade ago, but we do now.\"\u00a0\nShould heat warning criteria be updated?\u00a0\nDepending on greenhouse gas emissions, Edmonton could see the number of days above a humidex of 35 climb from around one a year to between four and 31 by the end of the century. Calgary could go from zero days with a high humidex to between one and 25.\u00a0\nBritish Columbia, too, could see significant change \u2014 Vancouver could go from one day a year with a high humidex to between six and 27 days.\nCurrently, Alberta and British Columbia are the only provinces that \ndon't trigger heat warnings based on humidex\n.\u00a0\n\"That's just something they've never experienced \u2014 or don't usually experience,\" Chow said.\nThere's also no humidex trigger for heat warnings in the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut, but projections show those regions are not likely to see many days over a 35 humidex within the coming decades.\nCastellan said that criteria for the heat warning program will continue to be revisited to adapt to climate change.\n\"In some ways, humidity might be a role that increases in the West, but we may still want to mostly forecast from a temperature point of view,\" he said, adding that even if it gets more humid, the West will likely remain relatively drier than Eastern Canada.\u00a0\nHow 1 city is preparing for a muggy, sticky future\u00a0\nRather than wait for other levels of government to adapt to new normals, the city of Lethbridge in southern Alberta took matters into its own hands.\n\"The [heat warning] thresholds are quite high in the province. This puts us in an awkward situation where we know things are happening in the community, but we're not meeting specific thresholds of provincially defined emergency,\" said Luke Palmer, an emergency planning and risk supervisor with the City of Lethbridge.\nAnnual deaths from extreme heat in B.C. could double by 2030 without climate adaptations: report\nYes, there are ways for Canadian cities to beat the heat\nHeat waves can be especially dangerous for seniors, low-income people\u00a0and those with mental health issues. Palmer said the city wanted to make sure it's ready to protect the most vulnerable.\nThat's why Lethbridge created its own city-defined heat warning. If local officials evaluate the weather forecast and determine conditions are severe enough \u2014 be it the temperature or humidity \u2014 the city can identify a local emergency, warning citizens and opening cooling centres, even if the temperatures don't meet provincial heat-warning criteria.\nLuke Palmer, an emergency planning and risk supervisor for the City of Lethbridge, says the reality in southern Alberta is that hot and humid days are already on the rise. \n \n(Andrew Brown/CBC)\nThe power was created in 2022 and Lethbridge has yet to use it, but Palmer said it's a tool in their back pocket to make sure they're prepared.\nScott Johnson, a spokesperson for Alberta Health, said that the province is also evaluating its approach to extreme heat and humidity, \"which are becoming a more regular occurrence.\nThe BC Centre for Disease Control is also evaluating its heat warning criteria and humidity is one of the factors being considered in the analysis.\nThe government of Canada, for its part, has pledged to \neliminate all heat wave deaths by 2040\n.\u00a0",

Protect their adult sons from ill-advised fights, for one.\nA new study has found that male southern resident killer whales are less likely to get scraped up by other whales when they have their post-menopausal mothers by their sides.\n\"This indicates that these post-menopause mothers are directing social support and protective behaviour towards their male offspring, and helping them avoid potentially dangerous interactions with other whales,\" lead researcher Charli Grimes told\n As It Happens \nguest host Robyn Bresnahan.\nThe findings \u2014 \npublished this month in the journal Current Biology\n \u2014 add to a long list of ways that orca mothers take care of their sons, long after they've grown up into five-tonne adults.\u00a0\n\"[Male orcas] have got a whole ocean to swim in, and we see them swimming really close with their moms. You know, they seem to be really dependent on them,\" Grimes, an animal behavioural scientist at the U.K.'s University of Exeter, said.\n\"If your mom's going to look after you, why look after yourself?\"\nThe menopause mystery\u00a0\nFemale orcas experience menopause and lose the ability to reproduce when they're around 40 years old. They can go on to live another 40 or 50 years after that.\n\"From an evolutionary perspective, animals should continue to reproduce until they die to pass on as many of their genes as possible to their future generations. So this is a really unusual strategy we're seeing in these whales,\" Grimes said.\nAn adult male orca with deep tooth rake marks on his fin. Southern resident killer whales have no natural predators, and they only eat fish, which means marks like this could only have come from another orca. \n \n(David Ellifrit/Center For Whale Research)\nIn fact, other than orcas, only humans and four other species of toothed whales are known to experience\u00a0menopause.\n\"A longstanding question in our own life history [of] evolution is how and why has menopause evolved?\" Grimes said. \"And now we've got this unique opportunity to explore it in killer whales that exist in really different physical and social environments.\"\nJen Gunter says menopause is a heck of a lot less scary when we talk about it\n'Meno TikTok' heats up as women seek better perimenopause info on social networks\nThe team looked at southern resident killer whales, a highly studied \u2014 and highly endangered \u2014 population of fish-eating orcas who live off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.\nBy studying photographs and census data on this population, the researchers determined that males with post-menopausal mothers in their pods were far less likely to have tooth rake marks\u00a0than males whose mothers are still of breeding age, or those who don't have a mother at all.\u00a0\nThe marks happen when another orca scrapes their\u00a0teeth against the male's skin during a bout of fighting or roughhousing.\u00a0Orcas don't have any natural predators, and the southern resident population\u00a0only eats salmon and other fish, so the tooth rake marks almost always come from members of their own species.\nThe team hasn't observed the behaviour directly, but Grimes says it's possible the elder females use their knowledge and experience to \"help her sons navigate the potentially risky interactions.\"\n\"Or it could be that she is directly involving herself when a fight looks likely,\" she said.\u00a0\nCharli Grimes is an animal behavioural scientist at the U.K.'s University of Exeter.\n \n(Submitted by Charli Grimes)\nKiller whale biologist Deborah Giles, who wasn't involved in the study, says the findings shine a light on the important role of older female orcas.\n\"It helps us explain some of what we see in these whales \u2014 and you know, quite honestly, probably other species of whales, if not even humans \u2014 where the grandmothers, the post-menopausal females in the group, are so important,\" Giles, the scientist and research director at the non-profit Wild Orca, told CBC.\n\"And it makes sense as far as, like, the postmenopausal mothers have more time to dedicate to their older sons, which is important because\u00a0these older males are the ones that are preferentially mating.\"\nA post-menopausal orca travels with her adult son.\n \n(Center for Whale Research)\nA healthy adult male orca has the potential to mate with a variety of females. So having strong, healthy, long-living sons is a mother's best chance of ensuring that her genes are passed on.\u00a0\nIn fact, keeping them out of scrapes is just one way orca\u00a0mommas look out for their boys. Mother orcas guide and feed their sons throughout their adult lives \u2014 \noften at the expense of their own well-being\n.\nOne 2012 study found\n that male orcas over 30 were eight times more likely to die in the year following their own mothers' deaths.\nRaising sons is draining killer whale mothers, study finds\nOrcas now taking turns floating dead calf in apparent mourning ritual\nOrca mothers don't, however, adopt a similar protective stance with their daughters. That's in part, says Giles, because the daughters don't need it.\n\"I don't think the females roughhouse in the same way,\" she said.\nBut it's also a matter of getting more bang for your buck, says Grimes.\n\"Both males and females will stay with their moms for their whole lives. But mating males have the opportunity to meet with multiple females, and when they do, they do so outside of their own family group, and so the burden of that cost falls on another group,\" she said.\n\"Whereas when a female breeds, she has to carry the calf herself for up to 18 months and that calf is raised inside her own family group, which comes at a cost in terms of resources.\"\nStruggling population\nSouthern resident killer whales are listed as endangered in both Canada and the U.S.\u00a0\nThere were only 73 alive as of January\n, according to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.\nThe reasons for this are myriad, \naccording to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n, and include increased noise from boats\u00a0and pollutants in the water that could reduce reproductive success.\nBut the biggest problem, says Giles, is the lack of salmon to eat.\nWATCH | B.C. boaters spot rare orca calf: \n#TheMoment a rare baby orca sighting brought people to tears\n13 days ago\nDuration \n1:16\nSpectators in B.C. got a surprise visit when a pod of orcas, including a calf, swam unusually close to a local fishing pier. Liz Lagos says that the experience brought her to tears.\n\"We're losing females in breeding age because there's not enough food. And so there's that these females aren't even getting old enough to go into menopause, let alone, you know, intervene on their adult sons' behalf,\" she said.\nOrcas' complex behaviours and social structures \u2014 including the role of older females \u2014 likely took tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, to evolve, she said.\u00a0\n\"And in a very short amount of time ... we humans have decimated their prey base.\"",

Big shiny photographs of big shiny humans.\nYou put coffee table books featuring any of the above in your living room\u00a0and they say: \"These giant books I never open reflect my taste.\" But do they also say say something else? Do they, perhaps say, \"I'm boring\"?\nA new coffee table book by two Italian photographers will definitely not say that. It's designed solely to showcase the beauty of chickens.\nAs It Happens\n host Carol Off spoke with Matteo Tranchellini, and his work partner, Moreno Monti, about their unusual\u00a0book\u00a0called \nCHICken\n, which they funded through a Kickstarter campaign.\u00a0\nHere is part of their conversation.\nMatteo, why did you decide to photograph these beautiful chickens?\nThis is our passion because we have a studio in Milano with a little garden. We want to have some pets. We decide to buy some chicken, some little chicken, beautiful chicken \u2014\u00a0a cocincina \u2014\u200b not a popular chicken.\nWhen we buy the chicken, we contact the farmer and the farmer invite us to photograph some chicken in an exhibition.\nThe work start in the exhibition because we start to photograph some chicken and we understand this animal is incredible \u2014\u200b like model.\u00a0\n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nBut these are like vogue fashion art pictures of these chickens. These are exquisite.\nYeah, because when the farmer asked us to photograph the chicken we realized that chickens are like model \u2014 top models. In this moment, we understand that the shooting is very different from the start of the work.\nWe are interested in the beauty of this animal. In this exhibition, there was many, many chickens. We choose some chickens.\nWhen we start with one exhibition we wanted to go to another one and another one, more. When we had 300 photographs of many, many chickens, we realized we had many material to make \u2026 we don't know what.\u00a0\nA book \u2014\u200b finally, yes. You have just the most amazing chickens. Did you know there were so many different kinds?\nNo. We discovered at the exhibition. We don't know so much about chicken, rooster and everything. We discovered many, many people are passionate about this animal. We were in front of the top models.\u00a0\n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nHow much co-operation did you get from these chickens?\nWhen the chicken was on the stage they stay five, 10\u00a0minutes maximum, because there was the flash, the camera, people around. The chicken make what they want. After 10 minutes, it's impossible to shoot them.\nDo you think they liked having all this attention?\nI think yes, because you can see on the picture. They are like a star,\u00a0an actress, a model. You can see in every animal the character of the animal.\u00a0\n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nThey strut quite a bit. Did you get roosters or just chickens?\nMany rooster and many chicken. Half and half, I think.\nDid any of your models become dinner?\nNo, no, no. Absolutely no. This kind of chicken are only for beauty.\nDid you harvest their eggs?\nYes, yes. Not too much because the selection is only for the beauty.\u00a0\n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nNow, I saw a video of you and your partner, of you and Moreno, and you were speaking chicken to one another. You talk chicken?\nAbsolutely.\nAlright, can you speak chicken for us?\nYes.\n(Moreno Monti\u00a0joins conversation:\u00a0\n\"\nMoooh-bah-bow-bow-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bow-moh-moh-bah-bah-bow-bow\n.\")\nThat's wonderful! They have taught you many, many words these chickens.\nYou understand?\nCompletely.\nWritten by John McGill. Interview produced by Anna Cianni. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

        "content": "Giant, wide-set eyes. Twitchy little noses. Long fluffy tails.\nSugar gliders \u2014 named for their love of sweet food and flying-squirrel-like gliding abilities \u2014 have a\u00a0cartoonish cute factor.\nIntroduced to the North American pet trade in 1994, they've recently been gaining popularity on the East Coast. Unlike other marsupials, they're legal to keep in all Atlantic provinces, including New Brunswick under the Fish and Wildlife Act.\u00a0 \nDr. Frank Cook, a veterinarian at the Moncton Animal Hospital, has noticed an uptick in sugar gliders in his office \u2014 several in the past few months. He likened the current vogue for sugar gliders to the ferret craze of the 1990s.\nA sugar glider, nicknamed Bailey, nestles into the clothing of breeder Gwynn Boy\u00e9. But don't be suckered in by that sweet face: for such a small animal, the marsupials are a huge commitment. \n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\n\"They certainly are an up-and-coming exotic pet,\" he said. \"They have the potential to become more popular here. Those big eyes looking at you, with the big space between them \u2014 it's pretty hard to resist that.\"\nBut sugar gliders are sweet by name,\u00a0not necessarily by nature.\nAs the animals become more popular as pets, breeders, vets, and owners want to get the message out: while they can be rewarding pets, they're not for the faint of heart.\n'She called him Demon'\nGwynn Boy\u00e9 runs Fundy Sugar Gliders,\u00a0one of the few breeders in Atlantic Canada.\nA lifelong fan of exotic pets, she got her first sugar glider from an owner advertising him on Kijiji for re-homing.\nThe owner \"called him Demon, because she thought he was possessed,\" Boy\u00e9 said. The species's more unique traits include loud nocturnal barking and \"crabbing\" (a weird sound, like metal caught in a paper shredder) when annoyed.\nDid we mention that they have sharp teeth and claws and can't be house-trained?\nBigger is better when it comes to sugar glider cages. Boy\u00e9 keeps her sugar gliders in custom-built, floor-to-ceiling mesh reptariums, which can be dismantled and cleaned in the washing machine. \n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nBoy\u00e9, on the other hand, was charmed. Demon's soft, grey fur reminded her of the pussy willows she used to collect as a kid.\n\"I like little, tiny fuzzy things,\" she said.\nA decade later, she\u00a0owns 10 sugar gliders:\u00a0three breeding pairs, and a pet colony of four. One of the females recently gave birth to two joeys that Boy\u00e9 nicknamed Barnum and Bailey.\nShe keeps them in a towering complex of mesh cages, which reaches to the ceiling of a spare room. They're filled with toys, snuggly fleece pouches, and hand-sewn accessories. During the day, the gliders tend to hang out nestled in a big ball inside their enclosures.\nFluffer, a two-year-old sugar glider, waits expectantly for a tasty mealworm treat. One thing would-be owners might want to consider is 'what [sugar gliders] might do to the smell of your home.'\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nHer two big dogs \u2014 a\u00a0Saint Bernard named\u00a0Dazey,\u00a0and Tesla, a Bernese-lab cross \u2014 tend to steer clear. They're freaked out by the noises the sugar gliders make.\nSince she started breeding them four years ago, Boy\u00e9\u00a0has adopted out more than 100 sugar gliders to homes across Canada, from Newfoundland and Labrador to British Columbia. Depending on their markings and whether or they've been fixed, the price tag ranges from $300 to $500.\nBoy\u00e9 has also helped re-home some 30 gliders that were surrendered by their owners when the demands of the little animals became too much.\nBoy\u00e9 is sympathetic. While she adores the little guys, she said, they're definitely \"not for everybody.\"\nOK, why not?\nSugar gliders are peculiar little creatures.\nTo start, there's their diet: a special goulash of yogurt, eggs or chicken, applesauce, calcium and other vitamins, fresh fruit and veggies. As special treats, they get mealworms, hornworms, and beetles.\u00a0Boy\u00e9 keeps plastic\u00a0trays full of live bugs for this purpose. But not too many. \"They\u00a0go\u00a0straight to their hips,\" she said.\u00a0\nThey can't be kept by themselves \u2014\u00a0they need the company of at least one other sugar glider \"or they lose their little minds,\" Boy\u00e9 said. They can't swim, which means they can drown easily in, say, a toilet bowl if the seat is left up. They have a gremlin-like aversion to bright lights.\nMealworms and bugs are a favourite snack of sugar gliders.\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nWhat Cook, the vet, calls a \"musky odour\" emanates from from scent glands \"on their forehead, near their front legs, and around the hind end.\n\"Sometimes I've heard the smell likened to the smell of a puppy,\" he said. (Boy\u00e9 said neutering the males drastically reduces this.) They're nocturnal, which means they sleep all day and run around, barking and literally climbing the walls, all night.\n\"So if you're getting them for your five-year-old child, that's not going to be so great,\" Boy\u00e9 said.\nGwynn Boy\u00e9, with Fluffer, started breeding sugar gliders as a hobby four years ago and hopes to collect one in every colour.  \n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nFor a small animal, gliders have a remarkably long lifespan.\n\"Some live up to 16 years,\"\u00a0 said\u00a0Boy\u00e9. \"Eight to 12 is the average. It's a commitment, like a dog or a cat. It's not like a hamster that's going to die in two or three years.\"\nAlso like a dog, a glider needs a lot of human contact.\n\"If they aren't properly socialized they can be mean,\" Boy\u00e9 said. \"I've had some that were genuinely mean little buggers.\"\n'My cat is terrified of them'\nKatelyn Forbes of Fredericton knows some of the challenges firsthand.\nShe and her boyfriend own two sugar gliders: Julian, a 2 \u00bd-year-old grey male, and Luna, a leucistic (all-white) one-year-old female.\nForbes's boyfriend ordered Julian from an online breeder, not fully prepared for everything the pet would need. Pretty soon, it became evident that Julian wasn't doing too well on his own.\n\"They have to be in pairs or they're prone to self-mutilate,\" said Forbes. \"They will over-groom themselves and start biting themselves. Then they can get infections and eventually die. They can even stop eating. It's not good.\"\nOnce Forbes purchased Luna from Fundy Sugar Gliders, \"it took two months to get them in the same cage together,\" Forbes said.\nFredericton sugar glider owner Katelyn Forbes with her two sugar gliders, Julian, left, and Luna.\n \n(Submitted by Katelyn Forbes)\n\"Now, they just love each other and are always with each other.\"\nForbes spends hours prepping fresh food for Julian and Luna, which she makes ahead of time and freezes in ice cube trays. Then there's cleaning the cages every morning, and playing with them for an hour every evening.\n\"My cat is actually terrified of them,\" said Forbes.\nShe has some advice for would-be owners.\n\"They are a lot to take on,\" she said. \"I wouldn't trade them for the world and I love doing it, but a lot of people wouldn't be able to devote that much time to them.\"\nCook said they'd be great for someone who wants a needy, interactive\u00a0pet they don't have to take for walks.\nFluffer chows down on a worm. Sugar gliders, like flying squirrels, have a patagium: a fold of skin between the foreleg and hind leg, pictured. In the wild, glide up to 50 metres from treetop to treetop. \n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\n\"They fill a niche for people that really want to interact [with their pets] but maybe can't interact inside and out the way you would with a dog.\"\nBoy\u00e9, a medic at Ambulance New Brunswick, recalled a military member with post-traumatic stress disorder who adopted two of her sugar gliders.\n\"[He] wanted them for therapy animals,\" she said. \"Sugar gliders were his thing, and he absolutely adored them.\"\u00a0 \nIn the wild sugar gliders eat flowers, nectar, eucalyptus tree sap, acacia gum, and insects. In captivity, they need a varied hash of yogurt, protein, vitamins, fresh fruit and veggies. They get mealworms, pictured, as a special treat.\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nIf their popularity in the United States is any indication, sugar gliders will continue to make their way into more homes in Atlantic Canada.\n\"Ten years ago there were three people in the Maritimes that had them \u2014 and I was one,\" Boy\u00e9. said. \"Now you're looking at a couple of hundred people.\"\nThey're also showing up in pet stores \u2014\u00a0a trend that deeply troubles Boy\u00e9. At a now-closed big-box pet store in Saint John, she said, employees \"had no idea\" about the sex of two sugar gliders priced at $400 each. They were also \"too young \u2026 probably four to five weeks when I saw them, and scared to death.\"\nA pair of five-week-old sugar glider joeys nicknamed Barnum and Bailey cuddle together. Sugar gliders must be kept in colonies of 2 or more or they 'lose their little minds,' said Boy\u00e9.\n \n(Julia Wright / CBC)\n\"They can't be socialized in a pet store, because pet stores are open in the day and full of bright lights \u2014\u00a0everything that they hate.\"\u00a0\nPeople should never get a glider from the temporary\u00a0kiosks\u00a0some backyard breeders set up at\u00a0fairs, or in shopping malls, \nwhere buyers have\u00a0run into all kinds of serious problems\n.\n\"The advice I have for people who are thinking about getting them is to do a lot of research,\" Forbes said.\n\"Make sure that you can take care of them properly before you actually get one.\"\nSugar gliders need a lot of human contact.\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)",

Information in the spring is really important, because if they have a long, long extended hatch, that can be a problem,\" he said.\nThis year's provincial \ngrasshopper forecast\n showed numbers increasing from last year, with the long, dry, warm late summer and fall in many parts of the province providing good conditions for egg laying.\nCrops in the south-central, southwestern and southeastern regions have been among the hardest hit.

The report said the quality of the hay ranges from fair to excellent, with the majority rated as \"good.\"\nSask. government asks feds for relief assessment to help livestock producers deal with drought\nRM of Dundurn declares agricultural disaster due to drought conditions in central Sask.\nPockets of moisture helped boost topsoil moisture levels in many areas, but \"the drought conditions in the southwest and west-central regions were not abated by the trace amounts of moisture or localized thundershowers,\" the report said.\nThe province reminds producers, especially those dealing with the dry conditions, that the Farm Stress Line is available to provide support toll free at 1-800-667-4442.",

        "content": "An idea that began when a classicist went to a brewery to sip beers and ponder the history of hops has brought to life an ancient ale.\nIt took hours of translating, milling and baking, but ale experimenters in Winnipeg have finally sipped a beer created from a fourth-century Egyptian alchemist's recipe.\n\"If you expect this to taste like a modern beer, you are not going to find that,\" said Matt Gibbs, chair of the University of Winnipeg's Department of Classics.\n\"This beer is very, very sour. It's good. It's much better than I thought it was when we first did it, I will say that much, but it's different.\"\nGibbs got the idea while sitting at a bar talking about old beers with a pair of brewmasters.\nThe original recipe was found in the book, \nThe Barbarian's Beverage: A History of Beer in Ancient Europe\n,\u00a0by Max Nelson at the University of Windsor. It was chosen because Gibbs figured he could stay close to the original process and, unlike some of the other recipes, the ingredients were available and legal.\nBeer made an old-fashioned way is shown at Barn Hammer Brewing Company in Winnipeg on Tuesday.\n \n(David Lipnowski/Canadian Press)\nGibbs received permission to translate the recipe out of ancient Greek and then got to work with brewers Tyler Birch and Brian Westcott, co-owners of Barn Hammer Brewing Co. in Winnipeg.\nFirst, they made a sourdough bread from water and barley flour milled by hand. It took 18 hours to bake the loaves at a heat low enough that the enzymes essential for beer-making stayed alive.\nThe loaves were then submerged in a fermenter at Barn Hammer.\nThe only major differences from the original recipe was that a stainless steel fermenter was used and the barley wasn't malted on a roof in the sun.\nWeeks went by and the experiment slowly turned from a murky mix to a pristine pint.\n\"After tasting the bread they made, I thought we were going to have something really disgusting, but it turned out really well,\" Birch said.\n\"I'm actually blown away by how good it is. It's actually very drinkable.\"\n \nThe simple taste of that makes it quite clear how much the palate has changed over 2,000 years.\n- Matt\u00a0Gibbs\nIt's not what most people would consider a beer and tastes more like a sour cider with hints of raisin or apple. The drink is flat because there was no carbonation more than 1,000 years ago. The brewers figure the alcohol content is about three per cent, similar to modern light beer.\nThe brew is not for sale \u2014 yet \u2014 but they are open to marketing an ancient batch in the future.\nThe ale is the beginning of research into how it and other beers were consumed by ancient societies. The initial batch has demonstrated how much brews have changed as technology around beer-making developed, Gibbs said.\n\"There were things we learned in terms of taste and technology and in processing, but I think the most important one was taste,\" he said.\n\"The simple taste of that makes it quite clear how much the palate has changed over 2,000 years.\"",

        "content": "A potentially record-breaking walleye got the break of its life last weekend.\nOn March 10, Robert Monty of Vermilion Bay, Ont., caught and released a giant walleye that he said was record-book calibre. The experienced angler had no idea when he started on the water near the northwestern Ontario city that day, it would end with such a bang.\n\"We went for crappies in the morning,\" said Monty. \"We never had too much luck, so we headed her back to the walleye spot.\"\n \nOntario teen lands record-breaking freshwater cod\n \n \nGiant Lake Simcoe burbot could dethrone long-held Ontario record from north\n \nMonty was fishing with his wife Donnalee, his friend Gilbert Grandbois and Grandbois' partner, Sheila Sjodin.\nMonty said\u00a0the spot they fish is near a creek mouth and is known to hold walleye in March. He said\u00a0the\u00a0walleye fishing is usually best in the evening.\n\"We got there about 3 o'clock,\" Monty said of their hot spot. \"It was about eight feet of water, and we set up our lines.\"\nHe added that when the sun started \"heading down the trees,\" he began to work his two jigging rods. Both were baited with a jig and a minnow. Monty said\u00a0he had just left one hole and was going to another one when Sheila cried\u00a0\"Robert, you've got a fish!\"\n \nA day in the life of an Ontario fishing guide\n \nThe angler then grabbed the rod and set the hook. \"It ran about two or three times on me,\" Monty said. \"My friend was looking at me and I said 'I think we have something big here.'\"\nMonty said\u00a0he could hear the eight pound test line rubbing on the ice and feared a break-off. \"I said 'I can't get his head up,'\" he said.\nThat's when Monty said he realized this was no normal walleye. Grandbois\u00a0quickly came to help. He grabbed the fishing line as Monty battled the fish just under the hole with his short jigging\u00a0rod.\nRobert Monty of Dryden, Ont., says his eyes \"popped out\" when he saw this giant walleye come through the ice hole on March 10, 2018.\n \n(photo credit: Donnalee Monty/Facebook)\nThe walleye's head slipped into the hole and filled it, Monty said, adding that Grandbois then leaned down and barely got two fingers in the gill plate.\nWhen the giant walleye was pulled out of the hole \"my eyes popped out,\" said Monty, adding that the fish measured 36 inches (91 centimetres) in length from nose to tail.\nHe said\u00a0he didn't measure the girth but it was one very fat walleye.\n\"When [Grandbois] pulled it out of the hole, we had a hard time and he had a hard time,\" Monty said. \"The walleye was scratching the hole ... it was a big girl.\"\nMonty said\u00a0after a few pictures were taken, he released the fish back down the hole.\nNear a record\nAccording to the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters fishing\u00a0registry, the present Ontario record walleye is 36.5 inches long (almost 93 centimetres) and had a girth of 21 inches (53 centimetres).\nThat fish was caught on May 26, 1943 and weighed 22 pounds and 4 ounces.\nMonty, who said he guided walleye anglers for many years on the English River system in northwestern Ontario,\u00a0said until last Saturday, his personal best walleye was 30 inches (76 centimetres).\nDespite the rarity of his catch, Monty said he has no regrets about releasing the walleye and does not plan to get a replica made.\n\"Just a picture and a memory,\" he said. \"There's always a bigger one out there.

        "content": "Last Tuesday, innkeeper Laura Chouinard set off on her afternoon run with her dog, Princess.\nIt was a typically crisp winter day in Saint-Alexis-de-Matap\u00e9dia, a quiet village in Quebec's Gasp\u00e9 region.\nSoon, though, as Chouinard told CBC\u00a0Radio's\u00a0\nQuebec AM\n, that tranquility\u00a0turned to\u00a0turbulence.\nChouinard noticed an ox trundling down a side lane, headed for the busy main road.\n\"I thought that beast could be in danger,\" Chouinard said. She decided to turn it back, away from the high-speed traffic.\n\"I grew up in farming country, so I am not at all afraid of animals.\"\nSeeing that the ox was still hornless, she guessed it was a two-year-old steer that had escaped from a nearby field.\nAngry bird dive-bombing passersby at Maison Radio-Canada\nWild turkey chases members, wreaks havoc at \u00cele-Bizard golf course\nShe made a racket to scare the animal, but it wouldn't change its course. Noticing the commotion, a couple of passing motorists swerved over to help.\nFinally, after about ten minutes of shooing and honking, the ox turned tail and Chouinard resumed her run.\nBeset by a beast\nChouinard had gone barely 15 feet along the main road when the ox came back for her. And this time, the signs were ominous.\n\"It was scraping the ground with its hooves \u2014 it looked angry,\" Chouinard said. The ox charged full tilt and caught her squarely in the breastbone with its massive head.\nA swollen right arm is one of Laura Chouinard's battle scars from her encounter with the runaway ox.\n \n(Submitted by Laura Chouinard)\nThe impact knocked her down, but the beast was unsated. It thundered on toward her.\n\"Its hooves came within six inches of my eyes,\" Chouinard said.\nGripped by fear, she resolved, \"I am not going to die today.\"\nRolling with the punches\nGathering her wits, Chouinard took stock of her situation. She was hemmed in by tall\u00a0snow banks and had little room to manoeuvre.\nThen, she remembered her karate training from 20 years ago. \"It's like swimming, you know. Even if you've not done it for a long time, you remember it quickly.\"\nThe scene of the \"crime\": Rustico Street North, to the left, is where the ox attacked Laura Chouinard.\n \n(Submitted by Laura Chouinard)\nHer martial arts moves helped Chouinard protect her vital organs. \"I had learnt how to defend my belly and my head. I presented my sides to the ox.\"\nThe ox kept pummelling her. It hit her some six or seven times.\nChouinard said calmly, \"I'm nearly 70 years old, but I'm in very good shape.\" Her extraordinary agility helped her roll away from the animal's deadly hooves every time it knocked her down.\nShaken, but not shattered\nDrawn by Chouinard's screams, a few drivers stopped to help. When their presence distracted the ox, she scrambled to safety up a snow bank.\nMeanwhile, the ox was briefly slowed in its tracks by a truck. But it soon went chasing after passersby, scattering them over the snowy countryside. It was finally subdued by the roar of a looming tractor that a neighbour drove over.\nThe snowbank that Laura Chouinard climbed to escape from the ox.\n \n(Submitted by Laura Chouinard)\n\"The whole thing lasted only two or three minutes,\" Chouinard said.\u00a0\"But it seemed like a lot longer.\"\nAn onlooker drove a shaken Chouinard home and a friend called an ambulance.\nAt the hospital, doctors X-rayed her whole body and were relieved to find no broken bones. \"The only reason I was not badly hurt is that I am fit and strong,\" she concluded.\nHiding in a small hole, Lac Saint-Jean cyclist survives possible tornado\nAfter 25 years, Montreal Biod\u00f4me's oldest animals celebrate milestone birthday\nChouinard is phlegmatic about her ordeal and bears the beast no ill will.\n\"It was just being an energetic animal enjoying its freedom,\" she said with a laugh.\u00a0\"Cattle escape from fields all the time.\"\nAlthough she doesn't blame him at all, the farmer who owns the ox was very apologetic and decided to sell off the offending animal.\nBruised all over and in considerable pain, Chouinard said gamely, \"I'll probably start running again next week.

They retail for well over $100 online. By Friday, there were only a few pairs left, mostly in larger sizes.\n \n(Chantal Dubuc/CBC)\nHumphries, who said he's salvaged\u00a0at the dump all his life,\u00a0said he immediately dug through the pile to find his size. A handful of others were also there, salvaging for a pair too,\u00a0he said.\nHumphries said he noticed that some pairs had people's names written on the inside neck of the boots\n \nI only took a few crates out there just to see what would happen. Lo and behold, they were all gone.\n- Lloyd Lush, local man who\u00a0owned the boots\n\"Just people's last names. Like Edgar, Joe, nothing out of the ordinary ... I assume it came from of the mines,\" he said, adding that miners often write their names to keep their footwear separate from the other workers.\nPeople excited, some concerned on social media\nWord of mouth turned the boots into a hot commodity in town.\u00a0\nOn a Facebook post shared in a Yellowknife Classifieds group, some people were elated with the news.\n\"I NEED a pair,\" wrote one resident.\u00a0\n\"Cheaper than Walmart,\" wrote another.\nMeanwhile others showed concerns about the amount of unnecessary waste at the dump, and some questioned\u00a0the safety of the boots.\nChristina\u00a0Socha, a Yellowknife resident, said she dropped by the dump Thursday.\n\"There\u00a0[were] only a few pairs left!\" she told\u00a0CBC\u00a0through a message.\nMan discovers trove of rubber boots after\u00a0auction\u00a0\nBut Lloyd Lush, a Yellowknifer of 35 years who works in the scrap metal and recycling business, said it was all meant for people to salvage.\nLush said he received the\u00a0surprise batch of footwear\u00a0after winning a bid at a mine\u00a0auction recently. Along with other equipment and motors, Lush said he cracked open the six, 4x4-foot wooden crates to discover he now owned hundreds of rubber, steel-toe boots.\nDe Beers to offload $30M in Snap Lake assets at 'massive' Yellowknife auction\nA recycler\u00a0by trade and\u00a0heart, Lush said he tried to share his trove.\n\"Nobody else wanted 'em.

'Lo and behold, they were all gone,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Lush, chuckling.\u00a0\"It's recycled.

You better get out there,\" said Lush.\u00a0\nFinding footwear at dump not uncommon\n\"Luckily these ones got salvaged, often they don't. And it's such a waste to destroy perfectly good stuff,\" said Humphries.\nHumphries\u00a0is a frequenter of the dump and said he\u00a0goes about once a week. He said finding\u00a0footwear isn't\u00a0uncommon.\nA few years ago, he said he found a heap\u00a0of about a hundred pairs of\u00a0white winter boots at the dump.\nWalt Humphries is a writer, artist and prospector who's lived in Yellowknife for over 40 years. He goes to salvage at the dump about once a week.\n \n(Submitted by Walt Humphries)\nHumphries said he wants the city to do something about large quantities of \"perfectly good\" products being trashed.\u00a0\n\"The city and the government ... should be a lot more proactive about making sure the good stuff doesn't end up buried at the dump,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"That makes absolutely no sense.\"\n\"We do encourage items to be donated to organizations when possible\u00a0such as the Habitat for Humanity ReStore at the Solid Waste Facility,\" stated\u00a0a city spokesperson in an email to CBC, adding residents are \"very familiar\" with salvaging opportunities at the dump.\nMORE NORTH NEWS |\u00a0\nThis Ottawa-area woman collects and recycles roadkill.

        "content": "Calgarians might be surprised to learn that five city councillors do not use their real names.\nIt's a curious thing, given that in politics your name often becomes part of your brand.\u00a0\nAre these elected officials not being true to themselves? Or are they just going with what's practical, comfortable or familiar?\nIt's not your everyday question but I recently asked them:\u00a0 Councillor, what's your real name?\nWithout further ado, let's meet these councillors.\u00a0\nCouncillor Harnirjodh Chahal\u00a0\u200b\nCoun. George Chahal chose his first name as a child.\n \n(CBC)\nChahal said his birth name is one with religious meanings and comes with a lot of history behind it.\u00a0\nFrom Punjabi, he said it translates in English as, \"God's immortal warrior.\"\nBut the rookie councillor said, \"I like George.\"\nAnd he has been George since his pre-school days.\u00a0\nHe recalls\u00a0how the switch came about as\u00a0one day, when he was young,\u00a0he got into trouble for something and he was asked for his name.\n\"I said my name was George Washington.\"\nHuh?\n\"I loved the name George and we've had some amazing people throughout history that were named George so why not?\"\nFrom then, he just kept using the name George.\nChahal said nobody calls him by his real name, not even his parents.\n\"I've actually considered legally even using George but I think out of respect to my parents and grandparents and generations before me, the importance of the name was given to me and out of respect for that, we'll keep it as is.\"\nAnd by George, that's how it will stay.\u00a0\nCouncillor Wen-Hsiang\u00a0Chu\nCoun. Sean Chu chose a name that sounds like part of his real name\n \n(Terri Trembath/CBC)\nSean Chu came to Canada in the 1980s from his native Taiwan.\nBut even before he arrived here, he said he was known as Sean.\nSoon after came to his new country, he recalls being at a barbecue with friends. \"The daughter said 'Hey, your nickname is Sean. So why don't you just use Sean. S-E-A-N.' And I said 'I like it.' So at that time, that was how the idea started.\"\nWhen he applied for his first Canadian passport, Chu said he needed an affidavit stating that he'd been using Sean for a number of years and the name was added to Wen-Hsiang Chu in his passport.\nEventually Sean became his first name and Wen-Hsiang his middle name.\nNow, he's just Sean Chu.\nHe said his mom still calls him Wen-Hsiang but he feels no need to revert to his real name.\u00a0 \nSean is, \"who I am. Not changing it at all.\"\u00a0\nCouncillor Prabhjote\u00a0Gondek\u00a0\nCoun. Jyoti Gondek goes by her nickname. \n \n(CBC)\nThe rookie councillor said it's important for her to use her full and legal name whenever she signs documents.\nBut Prabhjote Gondek says she's always been better known by a shorter version of her first name.\n\"Jyoti is the typical abbreviation for Prabhjote in Punjabi or Hindi. It's very much like William is Bill or Bob is short for Robert,\" said Gondek.\nAs for how that came about in her case, she said her parents started the habit but everyone has called her Jyoti since childhood.\n\"People who are of Indian origin get it because they're used to it. People who are not tend to struggle with it,\" she said.\n\"It's a little bit like being an Indo-Canadian if you will, I find Peggy to be a very strange abbreviation for Margaret. Yet most people who are exposed to that name get it.\"\nAnd if you're wondering about the meaning of Prabhjote, Gondek said it translates from Punjabi as \"a little flame\" or \"light from God.\"\n\"So when I light myself on fire in (council) chambers, now you know why!\"\u00a0\nAll joking aside, she said that she hopes everyone known as Jyoti can, \"get a little exposure out of people like me getting into positions like this.\"\nCouncillor Eric Jones\nCoun. Ray Jones uses a shortened version of his middle name, just like his dad.\n \n(CBC)\nWho?\nThat's right. Even the longest-serving member of Calgary city council isn't known by his real name.\nTo most, he's Ray or perhaps even Rundle Ray, his home community in northeast Calgary. But his real name is Eric.\u00a0\nAs for why he's been known as Ray all his life, it sounds like either his dad's to blame,\u00a0or it's what has become a family tradition.\n\"My dad was Thomas Alfred and he went by Alf. Second names. My son is Randall Scott and he goes by Scott. We all go by our second name,\" said Jones.\n\"Except my girls. They go by their first names,\" he said smiling.\nJones signs documents using his full name (Eric Raymond Jones) and uses Eric in email accounts too.\nBut does actually anyone call him Eric?\n\"My doctor. Revenue Canada,\" he said laughing.\n\"Everyone calls me Ray.\"\nCouncillor Biagio\u00a0Magliocca\n\u200b\nWard 2 Coun. Joe Magliocca chose his name because it's easier for many to pronounce than his Italian first name. \n \n(Mike Symington/CBC)\nWhen he ran unsuccessfully for city council in 2007, his lawn signs said Biagio.\nBut in 2013 and 2017, the signs just said Joe.\u00a0\n\"Biagio is really a true, traditional Italian name and there's a lot of Biagios in Italy,\" said Magliocca who readily and often talks about his family's heritage.\u00a0\nBut how he came to be Joe isn't just a derivation of Biagio.\u00a0\nMagliocca said many people couldn't say his first name. \"They'd say 'bee-ah-jo', 'badge-jo' and then they'd just call me 'joe' and I'd say 'Just call me Joe. That's my middle name. Just call me Joe.'\"\nHe said when he visits Toronto, family members all call him Biagio. But to friends, it's Joe.\u00a0\nWhen he was growing up playing road hockey, one of the other kids on the street was a guy named Paul Coffey, who went on to become an all-star defenceman in the NHL.\n\"He used to call me Joe the Slasher,\" laughs Magliocca, who jokes he's moved on from shins to budgets.\nAny thoughts about going back to the real deal, Biagio?\nNope.\n\"I heard a lot of feedback from a lot of people [in the 2007 election], saying I can't even pronounce your name. How do you pronounce it?' And I said: Just call me Joe.\"\nMORE CALGARY NEWS |\u00a0\nShe was a refugee \u2014 now this teen walks the runway for fashion world-heavy hitters\nMORE CALGARY NEWS |\u00a0\nCalgary has run out of room to store all that snow",

On the other hand we may have helped it over a hump and it might do well. Such is wildlife rehab.' \n \n(Dennis Minty Photography)\nSince the bird appeared to be in good shape after its night in the porch, they took it outside and gave it another once over and the last of the tilapia\u00a0before releasing\u00a0it at the edge of the river.\u00a0\n\"And off it went, it seemed fine,\" said Minty.\nIt isn't the first time the couple has helped out a creature\u00a0in need.\u00a0\nThey captured an ill red fox from the roadside in the community and brought it to Salmonier Nature Park for rehabilitation, and helped dozens of storm petrels that were blown inshore during bad weather.\nDennis Minty with a Dovekie that turned up on his lawn after an easterly gale in January of 2013.

Minty says seabirds become disoriented after being blown inland, and since they are accustomed to launching from the water or a cliff face, they have difficulty on land, especially in the woods.\n \n(Dennis Minty)\nMinty said one common rescue that people can do\u00a0is for small birds that fly into window glass.

        "content": "Jason Janes really loves to barbecue.\nHe can be found behind one of the three outside grills at his home in the Humber Valley on Newfoundland's west coast a few times a\u00a0week, and he keeps\u00a0things sizzling\u00a0all year long.\n\"I love things that are low and slow,\" he said, describing his favourite dish\u00a0\u2014\u00a0pulled pork with smoked macaroni and cheese.\nJanes says grooves will naturally form over time to match people's barbecue grates.\n \n(JuniperBBQScraper/Facebook)\nSo when Janes saw stories in the news about the dangers of wire bristles from barbecue\u00a0brushes becoming embedded in people's throats, he hit the hardware store.\nCanadian surgeons urge people to throw out bristle BBQ brushes\nWhat it feels like to have a BBQ brush bristle in your throat\nJanes\u00a0said he didn't have much luck finding a safer alternative, and the cedar shakes he was using to scrape the grill in the meantime were wearing out too quickly.\u00a0\n\"I said, 'Geez,\u00a0this is a bit of a nuisance,' so I called up my dad and said, 'Do you have a piece of juniper?'\"\nJason Janes started the scraper business in spring of 2017, and his wife Jackie and parents Lynn and Bern all help run it.\n \n(JuniperBBQScraper.com)\nThat's when he hit upon what just might become a million-dollar idea.\nJanes knew juniper is hard and durable and lasts a long time in the wood stove, so he carved a piece into a scraper.\nHe was so impressed with his invention he posted a picture\u00a0on social media to see if anyone else would want one, and then went on vacation for a couple of weeks.\nWhen he got back there were hundreds of replies.\nThe former tech entrepreneur now manufactures scrapers from his home garage, selling 5,000 in the first six months.\u00a0\nTruly home grown\u00a0\nThe choice of\u00a0tamarack, which is commonly referred to as juniper in Newfoundland and Labrador,\u00a0is key.\n\"It's just so beautiful. Every single piece is unique. It's like a piece of art,\" he said.\n\"And because it has a very high heat resistance it doesn't burn as fast on the barbecue\u00a0and will last longer than cedar \u2026 Also there's no such thing as Newfoundland cedar \u2014\u00a0it doesn't exist here. This is a local product. If it's cedar it's imported.\"\nJanes works in advance with the local harvesters who supply the pulp and paper mill in Corner Brook, and buys the juniper by the tractor trailer load.\u00a0\nA small load of juniper fresh out of the kiln is destined to become scrapers. \n \n(JuniperBBQScrapers/Facebook)\nJanes\u00a0said any splinters from his scraper, unlike wire bristles or pieces of bamboo that get caught on the grill and stuck in the food,\u00a0will simply burn up.\n\"If a splinter comes off this thing it just burns. It becomes smoke and flavour to the food.\"\nAll in the family\nThe budding business\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which started with the first prototype in May 2017\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is a family affair.\u00a0\nJanes's wife Jackie helps with shipping. His dad, Bern, pitches in on production when it's busy, and his mother, Lynn, hand-cut and sewed the straps for the first 1,000 units from old thrift-store leather jackets.\n\"We've well outgrown that,\" said Janes.\nThe scrapers are now available in 60 retail outlets throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, and a national distribution with a big chain is in the works.\nJanes also sells from his website and has shipped scrapers across Canada and the U.S., as well as to the Caribbean and the U.K.\u00a0\n\"We can feel it. It's here. I've been involved in a lot of startups over the years, and the ones that take off you can start to feel something when it's about to happen. You can sense it,\" he said.\nJanes says he is still using the prototype scraper he carved in May 2017.\n \n(JuniperBBQScraper/Facebook)\n\"It was a hobby and now it's starting to feel like a business. I feel that we're right on the verge of that. That's the part that I love.\"",

His instructor was award-winning writer Lisa Moore from St. John's.\n\"Half way through the course I wrote an article for an assignment.\u00a0Lisa said 'That's good, why don't you submit it to \nNewfoundland Quarterly\n?' I did\u00a0and they published it,\" Coultas told CBC News on Wednesday.\nFrom there,\u00a0Coultas pitched stories about the fishery to Nova Scotia's\u00a0\nSaltscapes\u00a0Magazine.\u00a0\nA former fisherman and fishery observer himself, it was a topic he was close to and had a lot of experience in.\nThose early publications set the table for what was to come next.\u00a0\nMoore challenged Coultas to write a novel.\u00a0\n\"The discipline of writing sort of came into sharp focus when I did the course and I realized, in short order, that I like it and it fits,\" he said.\nRevenge Finds a Home\u00a0\nis a murder-mystery that follows the lineage of two Irish relatives who find themselves in Newfoundland 180\u00a0years apart.\u00a0\nCoultas said he drew his inspiration from Scandinavian murder-mysteries and writers like\u00a0Henning Mankell.\nCoultas' new novel is his first. It was published by Flanker Press. \n \n(Submitted by Bill Coultas)\n\"The writing was exceptionally good, very dramatic, which caught my interest,\" Coultas said.\n\"I just loved his writing. When I kind of reread the\u00a0novel that got published I realized there was little bits of\u00a0Henning Mankell\u00a0into my novel in terms of approach.\"\nCoultas said he also dipped into his experiences as a foundation for his writing.\u00a0\nHe said much of his story simply flowed from his finger tips over the eight months it took to craft the tale.\nIt took 2\u00bd years to edit after hiring an outside editor before shopping the book.\n\"He was very ruthless and cruel and he'd say stuff like 'this is really stupid and get rid of this and get rid of that chapter,'\" Coultas said with a laugh.\n\"But, all for the better. I ended up rewriting a lot of stuff but that part was fun, too, and then I could see it taking a more solid, appealing approach.\"\nAfter the editing stage, the story was good to go.\nFlanker Press picked up the publishing rights and sent the novel to press almost immediately.\n\"They were very quick to come back and say 'I think we got a winner here.' They went ahead and published it,\" said Coultas.\n\"I didn't expect it. In the back of my mind, maybe it's my age, when I want to do something I go ahead and do it. I don't fret over 'is it going to happen.' I'm just kind of mentally moving on to other things.\u00a0\u2026 I didn't worry about that but it was just a delight to get the word that they were going to publish.

The moment, \nbeginning at 17 seconds into the video\n,\u00a0became a highlight of the tournament, and one that few in the gym that day will soon forget \u2014 especially since it will soon be widely broadcast on television.\u00a0\n\"I think it was just the fact that nobody really expected it, but when the first three people went down, everybody knew something was up,\" said McMullin.\nGrade 10 student\u00a0and BEC\u00a0Bears shooting guard\u00a0Aaron MacLean was the second-last player to hit the court.\nIt was his first Coal Bowl and he was excited to do the traditional run around the gym.\n\"I ran out high-fiving all the kids, then I saw 10\u00a0guys fall right before me, so I started kind of laughing,\" he said. \"So I tried to kind of run around them, and it was worse than ice. As soon as I touched it, I was one of the last ones, and I went flying.\"\n MacLean was among the last to fall.\n \n(Holly Conners/CBC)\nStill a mystery\nThe culprit?\n\"They said some kids spilled pop or Gatorade on the floor,\" said MacLean. \"It didn't feel like pop or Gatorade.

At least we went down as a team.\"\nMacLean never learned who spilled the drink.\n\"I wish I kind of did, you know. It kind of made us famous.\"\nWhen McMullin got home after the\u00a0game, he posted his video to Facebook.\n\"I got, I think, a thousand views the first night.\"\nAfter that, his mom suggested submitting it to \nAmerica's Funniest Home Videos\n.\nIt's a hit\nAbout\u00a0three weeks later, he learned it had been accepted.\n\"I was in my room freaking out 'cause I got a phone call, and she was like, 'Oh yeah, you're coming down to L.A.'\"\nMcMullin flew to California over March break for the show taping, where his video made it into the final three.\nHe can't reveal the outcome of the show before it airs May 6, when it's estimated as many as six\u00a0million\u00a0people will be watching, according to executive producer Michele Nasraway.\nAFV receives between 4,500 and 5,000 video submissions each week, she said.\u00a0\nScreeners look for clips that are funny or unusual.\nMcMullin went to Los Angeles in March for a taping of the show.\n \n(Holly Conners/CBC)\nTough field\n\"To see 12 basketball players come out, and slip and fall in quick succession was highly unusual, and it made us laugh,\"\u00a0said\u00a0Nasraway.\nMcMullin's pratfalling basketball players are up against some tough competition: a young girl and two toddlers.\n\"Kids and animals definitely seem to be preferred videos amongst voters,\" said Nasraway.\nThe winning video takes home $10,000 US.\u00a0Second place gets $3,000, and third place gets $2,000.\nFor MacLean, it's an honour just being nominated.\n\"It's just amazing that someone from small town New Waterford can go on something this big, 'cause I grew up watching \nAFV\n, and I just think it's great.\"\nRegardless of whether the BEC\u00a0Bears take the win on \nAFV\n, they had the satisfaction of regaining their composure after their group tumble and winning that Coal Bowl game.\n\"We came back and pulled out the win,\" said MacLean. \"Didn't really mess with the corner though.

He says people in his area are worried about U.S. politics.\n \n(John Geddie/Reuters)\nWhipps told a Washington audience at\u00a0a\u00a0Foundation for Defense of Democracies gathering\u00a0that Palau is a model U.S. ally\u00a0\u2014 it's blocked plans for a Chinese casino next to a U.S. radar site, and it wants to rip up and replace the country's Huawei cellular infrastructure.\nBut with the U.S.-Palau pact again up for renewal, Whipps\u00a0said he hoped to avoid a repeat of last time.\n\"If the relationship is that important, you have to show it,\"\u00a0he\u00a0told the audience, noting that allies\u00a0don't want to see the U.S. so caught up in\u00a0internal politics\u00a0that it ignores international responsibilities.\u00a0 \n\"Because I think that's what our people at home kind of fear sometimes \u2014\u00a0you know, we see how divided [Capitol] Hill is.\"\u00a0\nU.S. Sen. Rand Paul, in an effort to get more information about the origins of COVID-19, has stalled all confirmations to senior U.S. diplomatic posts.\n \n(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\nPolitical polarization isn't all bad. Robust debate can reduce the risk of groupthink and related errors, and is part of what\u00a0makes democracies resilient.\nGenerations ago, political scientists\u00a0\ncomplained\n\u00a0about the opposite problem: that U.S. political parties were too similar and\u00a0they agreed too much.\nAnalysis\nAs U.S. and China spiral toward strife, they give diplomatic peace a chance\nFormer U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger, 100, meets with China's top diplomat in Beijing\nBut several scholars who study the interplay between domestic and foreign politics say the U.S. has swung way beyond the healthy level.\n\"I think it is a big problem,\" said Jordan Tama, who specializes in domestic politics and foreign policy at American University.\n\"We are shooting ourselves in the foot \u2014 not putting in place key national-security officials\u00a0\u2026 It's troubling.\"\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, seen during a media conference on July 14, is making his 12th trip to the Indo-Pacific region, an area of increasingly intense U.S. focus.\n \n(Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana/Reuters)\nForeign policy at loggerheads is nothing\u00a0new\nAnother type of polarization involves\u00a0substantive disagreements on foreign affairs that see the U.S. zigzagging\u00a0on certain policies\u00a0from one administration to the next.\nThe Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal\u00a0and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, for example, were\u00a0all policies adopted under Barack Obama and\u00a0cancelled under Donald Trump. In\u00a0some cases, they're now being renewed under Biden.\nCanada to 'significantly' enhance military presence in Indo-Pacific region, Anand says\nAnalysis\nU.S. faces blunt \u2014 but useful \u2014 reception in Beijing. Is there a lesson for Canada?\nOne scholar of international relations joked that this is the reason Secretary of State Antony Blinken has made 12 trips to the Indo-Pacific \u2014\u00a0and probably needs to do 12 more.\nPeter Trubowitz said the world is dizzy from trying to follow these U.S. foreign policy zigzags and figure out whether the country's current positions\u00a0\nwill survive the next election\n.\n\"America's allies need to be reassured,\" said Trubowitz, an American and director of the U.S.-focused Phelan Centre at the London School of Economics.\n\"One of the reasons they need to be reassured is because the United States is so deeply polarized.\"\nAt Clemson University in South Carolina, political scientist Jeffrey\u00a0Peake\u00a0has tried charting\u00a0one reason this matters: a collapse in frequency of U.S. international treaties.\nBetween the Second World War and the presidency of George W. Bush, Peake\u00a0counts an average of 16 treaties per year submitted for approval by the U.S. Senate. That dropped to four per year under Obama.\u00a0\nDuring the last two presidencies, it's eroded to one a year.\nBecause it's gotten harder to pass a treaty through Congress,\u00a0Peake says\u00a0presidents just sign\u00a0agreements that aren't entrenched in law, making it easy for a successor to simply cancel them. As Trump did, for example, with the climate accord.\nForeign policy paralysis has happened before. When Woodrow Wilson, left, tried creating the League of Nations in 1919, the U.S. Senate blocked American participation. Some analysts say the current level of partisanship is without precedent since the U.S. became a global superpower.\n \n(Reuters)\nGlobal implications\nThese types of actions have\u00a0major global implications, according to Peake.\u00a0\"The world doesn't really address climate change without the U.S. on board.\"\u00a0\nAnd bitter disagreements about international affairs aren't new. In one famous example from 1919,\u00a0the U.S. Senate \nrejected\n Woodrow Wilson's plan for the \nprecursor to the United Nations\n; the idea lay dormant for another three decades, through another world war.\nThe Senate later rejected the UN's \ngenocide convention\n for four decades, \narms-control\n treaties and various \nclimate accords\n. The chamber has also often blocked appointments over disputes.\nBut Peake says\u00a0what's happening in Washington right now is not\u00a0a foreign policy disagreement \u2014 it's about foreign policy becoming hostage to domestic disputes.\u00a0\nAnd it's triggered separate blockades\u00a0of\u00a0senior military and senior diplomatic\u00a0confirmations.\nFormer football coach Tommy Tuberville, now a U.S. senator for Alabama, says a policy to fund abortions for military personnel has no basis in law. So he's launched a blockade against senior military appointments in hopes of forcing a reversal of the policy.\n \n(Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters)\n\"This is not something you see typically in U.S. history,\" Peake said, noting that in normal times, Alabama voters would punish\u00a0Tuberville for blocking the confirmations.\nInstead, because the U.S. is so polarized, they're more likely\u00a0to reward him for standing up to Democrats.\nThe benefits of messy debate\nThere are many examples throughout U.S. history where a little more argument might have helped matters.\nIn 2003, for example,\u00a0there was \nlittle opposition to the Iraq war\n\u00a0in Congress.

In 1964, after only \n40 minutes of debate\n, Congress voted to increase its military involvement in Vietnam \u2014\u00a0the vote was 416-0 in the House of Representatives and 88-2 in the Senate.\n\"Bipartisanship is not a cure-all,\" Trubowitz said. \"Too much of anything can be a bad thing.\"\nThere are many examples in U.S. history of time when vigorous debate would have helped matters. Including during the Vietnam war, when the U.S. voted to increase its military action after almost no discussion and a 416-0 vote in Congress. \n \n(Reuters)\nJim Carafano, a national-security analyst who served on Donald Trump's presidential transition team\u00a0and has a long military and history background, said the unfilled positions\u00a0are not ideal.\n\"It is problematic,\" Carafano said of the military vacancies, which he says\u00a0create inconveniences and planning problems, but he doesn't think they're debilitating. Besides, he says there's no example of an urgent foreign crisis where the U.S. was prevented from acting.\n\"Is it hamstringing the [American] giant, you know, tying us down like Gulliver with the Lilliputians? I don't see that.\"\nHis bottom-line view: democracy is resilient.\nThe current logjams, Carafano\u00a0says, will eventually clear, voting coalitions will eventually undergo one of their transformative realignments\u00a0and the parties will look different.\nCanada's ambassador to China says nations must co-operate despite strained relationship\nIt's a view as old as American history.\nWhen he visited the U.S. at the dawn of the republic,\u00a0French writer Alexis de Tocqueville \nremarked\n that autocratic rule looks\u00a0stable \u2014\u00a0until it isn't. Democracy, he wrote, looks messy but it's sturdy.\nThen again, he \nalso wrote\n that democracies are bad at handling foreign affairs.\nNow, the U.S., the world's self-described oldest democracy,\u00a0seems determined to test both theories at once, confronting great foreign challenges\u00a0while there's so much squabbling in the household.",

In April, legislation was passed allowing conscription summonses to be served online instead of in person.\nCompulsory military service has long been a sensitive issue in Russia, where many men go to great lengths to avoid being handed conscription papers during the twice-yearly call-up periods.\nWATCH |\u00a0It just became harder to avoid conscription in Russia:\n\u00a0\nIt just got harder to avoid conscription in Russia\n3 months ago\nDuration \n2:28\nRussia's parliament has approved new legislation to allow draft notices to be delivered electronically and impose restrictions on those who don\u2019t comply.

        "content": "One could be forgiven for describing the mint's newest coin as rather otherworldly.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint's newest offering features Manitoba's most famous UFO encounter, which happened in 1967\u00a0when Stefan Michalak\u00a0went looking for precious metals near Falcon Lake.\n\"I was very surprised, frankly. They called me out of the blue and said 'I have this idea,'\" said Stefan's son, Stan Michalak.\u00a0\n\"It's not every day the mint calls and says, 'Hey, we're going to do a coin.'\"\nFrom CBC News\nFalcon Lake incident is Canada's 'best-documented UFO case,' even 50 years later\nStefan, whom his son says was a \"rock nut,\"\u00a0was searching for gold, silver and other precious metals and gems in Whiteshell Provincial Park one May long weekend in 1967. At about noon, two craft appeared in the sky, he said, and one landed about 50 metres away from Stefan on a flat rocky area.\nThe other craft left, but the first stayed, said Stefan. He observed it from the bush for about half an hour before approaching it.\n\"In his mind, he reasoned, 'This must be some sort of a military experimental craft. They've landed here by mistake or maybe out of need. Maybe they're in trouble,'\" said Stan. \"'I'll offer to help them out.'\"\nWhen Stefan approached the craft, which he later described as saucer-shaped and made of a stainless steel material, he touched it and the heat melted the fingertips of his heavy gloves. There was an opening he put his head through, said Stan, but he didn't enter.\nThe craft then expelled a cloud of gas and lifted off, knocking Stefan off his feet, setting his shirt aflame and leaving a distinct pattern of burns on his chest.\nThere will be only 4,000 of the collectors coins minted.\n \n(Royal Canadian Mint)\nThe coin shows the moment the craft lifted from the rock,\u00a0with\u00a0a figure lying on the ground with a hand in the air, as if to ward something off. In the dark, the craft on the coin glows, as does the gas coming from the ship.\nThe coin is ovoid and uses more colours than traditionally found in a coin, said Stan.\n\"They sent me a proof that had their original thought, which was kind of cute,\" said Stan. \"Originally, it was going to have alien eyes on it, so it looked like the shape of an alien head.\"\nErica Maga, product manager for the coin, said the idea came to the team during their annual research.\n\"We thought it was such an interesting story that it was one that we had to share with Canadians,\" said Maga. \"Everyone is sort of fascinated by this subject matter and we thought it would make a really interesting coin design.\"\nThe coin has been in production for a few months but went on sale Monday, said Maga.\u00a0The coin's egg shape, while unusual, was also used for\u00a0coins with a hot air balloon and featuring Ukranian\u00a0pysanka.\nMaga\u00a0confirmed one of the earliest designs featured glow-in-the-dark alien eyes.\n\"We had talked around a lot of really wacky ideas and interesting concepts for this one, but in the end, we wanted to try and stay as faithful and true to the story as we could.\"\nDespite the Manitoba connection, the coin is\u00a0being minted in Ottawa instead of Winnipeg,\u00a0said Alex Reeves, external communications advisor for The Mint. The Winnipeg facility does currency coins, while the Ottawa facility specializes in collector coins.\nUFO sightings in Manitoba date back to 1792\nStan, who \nco-wrote a book\n about his father's encounter, said he hopes the coin helps end his family's saga.\n\"We just decided to put this to rest, and I think the mint, giving me a call and saying 'We have this idea,' I think it just puts the ribbon on the box to finally close it forever.\"\nThe $20 legal\u00a0tender coin can be ordered from \nthe mint's website\n. It retails for $129.95.",

        "content": "For years, Canada and other NATO member countries have faced criticism for falling short of allocating two per cent of their\u00a0GDP on military spending, a target set in 2014 by the military alliance.\nCanada was among the allies who signed on in 2014 to aspire toward\u00a0that target but has consistently failed to reach it.\nHowever, earlier this month, NATO member leaders pledged to boost spending on national defence, agreeing to make the existing target of two per cent of GDP the minimum spent each year, with one-fifth of that going toward major equipment and research and development.\nStill, it's unclear when such a target might be realized. While Canada has agreed to the benchmark, it has not set out a plan to reach it.\nThe agreement also raises questions about the kind of budgetary pressures Canada would face by spending billions more a year on its military.\u00a0And would that extra spending fundamentally transform the country's defence forces?\u00a0\nCan Canada afford the boost in military spending?\nThere would be no way for Canada to meet its NATO spending commitment without\u00a0taking on significantly more federal deficit and debt\u00a0than is already planned.\nThat's according to Jack Fuss, director of fiscal studies at the Fraser Institute, who, in a recent \nToronto Sun\u00a0column,\n\u00a0wrote that\u00a0Canada couldn't boost spending on the military \"without seriously weakening its fiscal position,\" unless it's \"finally willing to prioritize such spending over other currently favoured federal initiatives and programs.\"\nAccording to figures from NATO, the budget for the Canadian military in 2023 is $36.7 billion or 1.29 per cent of GDP.\u00a0\nAdding 0.7 seven percentage points to reach the two per cent mark this year would mean an extra $20 billion in spending. And that would come as Canada already faces a $40-billion deficit.\n\"Without touching revenues, this will create a fiscal sustainability problem likely for the federal government,\"\u00a0Kevin Page, former parliamentary budget officer for Canada, said in a phone interview with CBC News.\u00a0\"So you can't just add this to the deficit.\"\n\u00a0It will also create the conversation,'how are we going to finance this?, he said.\u00a0\n\"What would we do on the revenue side? What would we do on the spending side? Would we try to make room for it by cutting certain types of other programs?\"\nNATO member leaders, seen at the NATO summit on July 11 in Vilnius, Lithuania, pledged to boost spending on national defence. They agreed to make the existing target of two per cent of GDP the minimum spent each year, with one-fifth of that going toward major equipment and research and development. \n \n(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\nPedro Antunes, senior economist for the Conference Board of Canada, said the extra spending on the military would be in line with the\u00a0overall\u00a0increase in spending by the Liberal government over the last number of years.\nYet an extra $20 billion would\u00a0certainly be a significant \"chunk of change,\" he said.\n\"We've already spent so much on everything,\" he said. \"The fiscal situation is quite tight and we certainly wouldn't have $20 billion available.\n\"I certainly have concerns about adding to the deficit. Are we essentially going to finance this with more debt? I think that's problematic.\"\nAlthough it may not be exactly an\u00a0extra\u00a0$20 billion a year. The government, back in 2017,\u00a0committed to long-term investments in the Canadian Armed Forces.\nTaking that into account,\u00a0a June 2022 report by\u00a0the Parliamentary Budget Office forecast that to achieve the two per cent of GDP target military spending, Ottawa would need to spend an extra $15.5 billion in 2023-24; $14.5 billion in 2024-25; $14.1 billion in 2025-26; and $13\u00a0billion in 2026-27.\nIf Canada did ramp up its spending to 2 per cent, would this fundamentally change the military?\nIt certainly wouldn't happen immediately, experts say. And that, in part, is because of procurement processes.\nDozens of political and military luminaries call on Ottawa to stop backsliding on national defence\n\"They have not fixed the procurement processes,\"\u00a0Carleton University Prof. Stephen Saideman\u00a0told The Canadian Press. \"They have a personnel shortage. Together, those two things make it hard, just simply hard, to spend money. Even if you allocate a lot of money, the actual spending of it is hard.\"\nDavid Perry, president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, an Ottawa-based think-tank that covers topics including\u00a0defence, diplomacy, trade, resources\u00a0and development, agreed that\u00a0capacity to implement is a big consideration.\n\"The government publishes any kind of bold new plan to spend money on virtually anything today, [and] with a few exceptions, it takes a couple of years basically to get any of that really moving.\u00a0So that's realistically what you're looking at in terms of what it would mean for the forces.\n\"There's an assumption out there that some people have that to hit that mark, we'd be talking about totally transforming our military,\" he said. \"I'm not entirely convinced.\"\nThere are many \"big ticket pieces\" of equipment that do not currently have funded replacement programs, Perry said, including items like\u00a0submarines, maritime coastal defence vessels and the current fleet of main battle tanks.\nThere's also the physical infrastructure of\u00a0DND, parts of which are decades old, Perry\u00a0said.\n\"So there's lots of different funding pressures right now that I think would soak up huge amounts of spending if the government were able to do it, without basically doing anything new.\"\nAnd any long-term infusion of cash would mean a \"gradual evolution of the military, not something transformative,\" he said.\nAccording to figures from NATO, the budget for the Canadian military in 2023 is $36.7 billion or 1.29 per cent of GDP.\u00a0 Adding 0.7 percentage points to reach the two per cent mark this year would mean an extra $20 billion in spending.\n \n(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\nCraig Stone, an\u00a0emeritus associate professor of defence studies at the Toronto-based Canadian Forces College, said such a boost in spending would raise questions of what that money would be used for.\n\"Are we going to increase the size of the [Canadian Armed Forces]\u00a0by 5,000 people? How much money does that actually mean over time?\"\nOr would they focus on investing in capital equipment,\u00a0\"so more F-35s, more modern equipment, submarines?\" he said.\nThat kind of\u00a0funding boost\u00a0certainly would allow the military to do some significant capital investment\u00a0and allow the Canadian military to modernize\u00a0most of its obsolete equipment, he said.\nBut there are other challenges, Stone said.\nU.S. report claims Trudeau told NATO Canada will never meet its military spending target\nAnalysis\nNATO's two per cent spending target \u2014 where it came from, what it means\nFor example, the military could probably get F-35s in a reasonable amount of time because they've already started a process, he said.\u00a0\nWATCH |\u00a0Canada will buy F-35 fighter jets to replace aging CF-18s:\u00a0\nCanada will buy F-35 fighter jets to replace aging CF-18s\n7 months ago\nDuration \n1:58\nAfter years of delays, the federal government has signed a $19-billion deal to buy a fleet of F-35 jet fighters to replace the air force's aging CF-18s. It\u2019s a dramatic turnaround for the Liberals who came to power vowing never to buy the stealth warplane.\nBut to buy, for example, new submarines, the first issue would be whether\u00a0Canadian industry\u00a0has\u00a0the ability to build submarines or sustain submarines once they're built.\n\"And the answer to that is probably no,\" Stone said.\u00a0\"And so who do you partner with? And that's\u00a0not even having a debate about whether\u00a0it's nuclear-powered so it actually can be under the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean.\"\n\"That's 10\u00a0years at least to even think about getting a submarine. It's a complex piece of equipment and\u00a0there's not very many nations that can build them.\"\nAs well, the defence\u00a0industry\u00a0has the same challenges as the rest of the manufacturing sector has\u00a0\u2014 a shortage of workforce, he said.\u00a0\n\"You don't have that surge capacity that you'd like to have because you don't have the workforce to do it.\"",

The Defence Ministry claimed that the military jammed both attacking drones, forcing them to crash.\nRussian media reported that one of the drones fell on the Komsomolsky highway near Moscow's centre, close to the main Defence Ministry building.

It said that Ukrainian forces downed three of the attacking drones.\nThe strike was the latest in a barrage of attacks that has damaged critical port infrastructure in southern Ukraine in the past week. The Kremlin has described the strikes as retribution for last week's Ukrainian strike on the crucial Kerch Bridge linking Russia with Crimea.\nSpeaking at the Aspen Security Forum via video link over the weekend, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the bridge a legitimate target for Ukraine, noting that Russia has used it to ferry military supplies and it must be \"neutralized.\"\nSince Moscow cancelled a landmark grain deal a week ago amid Kyiv's grinding efforts to retake its occupied territories, Russia has launched repeated attacks on Odesa, a key hub for exporting grain.\nRussian investigators and emergency services members gather near a destroyed car on the damaged section of a road following an alleged attack on the bridge that connects the Russian mainland with the Crimean peninsula across the Kerch Strait. \n \n(Investigative Committee of Russia/Reuters)\nOn Sunday, at least one person was killed and 22 others wounded in an attack on Odesa that severely damaged 25 landmarks across the city, including the Transfiguration Cathedral.\nUNESCO strongly condemned the attack on the cathedral and other heritage sites and said it will send a mission in coming days to assess damage.

        "content": "Israeli lawmakers on Monday approved a key portion of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's divisive plan to curb the powers of the country's justice system despite massive protests that exposed unprecedented fissures in Israeli society and accused the government of pushing the country toward authoritarian rule.\nThe vote came after a stormy session in which opposition lawmakers chanted \"shame\" and then stormed out of the chamber.\nIt reflected the determination of Netanyahu and his far-right allies to move ahead with the plan, which has tested the delicate social ties that bind the country, rattled the cohesion of its powerful military and repeatedly drawn concern from its closest ally, the United States.\nThe overhaul calls for sweeping changes aimed at curbing the powers of the judiciary, from limiting the Supreme Court's ability to challenge parliamentary decisions to changing the way judges are selected.\nA water cannon is used to disperse demonstrators blocking the entrance of the Knesset in Jerusalem on Monday, amid a months-long wave of protests against the government's planned judicial overhaul.\n \n(Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty Images)\nNetanyahu and his allies say the changes strengthen democracy by limiting the powers of unelected judges and giving elected officials more powers over decision-making.\u00a0\nBut protesters see the overhaul as a power grab fuelled by personal and political grievances of Netanyahu \u2014\u00a0who is on trial for corruption charges\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and his partners.\nHis allies, who include ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious parties, have promoted such goals as increased West Bank settlement construction, annexation of the occupied territory and limiting the rights of LGBTQ+ people and Palestinians.\nLegislators surround Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, centre, at a session of the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem on Monday. \n \n(Maya Alleruz/The Associated Press)\nIn Israel, which does not have a formal constitution, the judiciary plays a critical oversight role in the country's system of checks and balances.\nUnder the Israeli system, the prime minister governs through a majority coalition in parliament \u2014\u00a0in effect giving him control over two branches of government. By moving to weaken the judiciary, critics say, Netanyahu's allies will consolidate power by weakening the independence and oversight of judges. They liken the process to \"illiberal\" democracies like Poland and Hungary.\n\"It's a sad day,\" opposition leader Yair Lapid said after the vote. \"This is not a victory for the coalition. This is the destruction of Israeli democracy.\"\nA police officer shoves a demonstrator during a protest rally against the Israeli government's judicial reform plan in Tel Aviv on Monday. \n \n(Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images)\nIn Monday's vote, lawmakers approved a measure that prevents judges from striking down government decisions on the basis that they are \"unreasonable.\"\nWith the opposition out of the hall, the measure passed by a 64-0 margin.\nAfter the vote, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, the architect of the plan, said parliament had taken the \"first step in an important historic process\" of overhauling the judiciary.\nIsraeli PM Netanyahu announces pause on judicial reform after mass protests\nMore mass protests are now expected, and the Movement for Quality Government, a civil society group, immediately announced it would challenge the new law in the Supreme Court.\nThe grassroots protest movement condemned the vote, saying Netanyahu's \"government of extremists is showing their determination to jam their fringe ideology down the throats of millions of citizens.\"\n\"No one can predict the extent of damage and social upheaval that will follow the passage of the legislation,\" it said.\n'We won't service a dictator'\nHundreds of people blocked Jerusalem's main highway after the vote. Walls and fences running the length of the street outside the Supreme Court, prime minister's office and parliament were plastered with hundreds of stickers reading \"we won't service a dictator,\" \"democracy or rebellion\" and \"save Israel from Netanyahu.\"\nPolice tried to clear away the crowds with water cannons spraying skunk-scented water.\nWATCH | Israelis flood streets to protest judicial reform bill:\u00a0\nControversial Israeli judicial reform bill passes first stage\n1 day ago\nDuration \n2:05\nIsrael's ultra-nationalist coalition government passed the first stage of a controversial judicial reform that would prevent the country's supreme court from blocking government decisions. Israelis opposed to the decision have taken to the streets for weeks and marched on the Knesset.\nEarlier, demonstrators blocked a road leading up to the parliament, and big mall chains and some gas stations shuttered their doors in protest.\nFurther ratcheting up the pressure on Netanyahu, thousands of military reservists have declared their refusal to serve under a government taking steps that they see as setting the country on a path to dictatorship. Those moves have prompted fears that the military's preparedness could be compromised.\nPM released from hospital\nThe vote came only hours after Netanyahu was released from the hospital, where he had a pacemaker implanted.\u00a0\nHis sudden hospitalization added another dizzying twist to an already dramatic series of events, which were watched closely in Washington.\nThe Biden administration has frequently spoken out against Netanyahu's government and its overhaul plan. In a statement to the news site Axios late Sunday, U.S. President Joe Biden warned against pushing ahead with the legal changes that were sparking so much division.\nNetanyahu says he's 'doing excellently' after getting pacemaker amid judicial reform turmoil\n\"Given the range of threats and challenges confronting Israel right now, it doesn't make sense for Israeli leaders to rush this \u2014\u00a0the focus should be on pulling people together and finding consensus,\" he said.\nBiden has also been critical of the government's steps to deepen Israel's occupation of the West Bank.\u00a0\nThe massive, sustained democracy protests have shunned mention of Israel's 56-year occupation of lands the Palestinians seek for their hoped-for independent state, fearing the issue might alienate supporters. But critics portray this rule over another people as a major stain on Israel's claim to be a liberal democracy and accuse the protesters of harbouring a significant blind spot in their struggle.\nOpposition\u00a0mostly from secular middle class\nThe overhaul has exposed deep divisions in Israeli society \u2014\u00a0much of it along religious, ethnic and class lines.\nWhile protesters come from all segments of society, they come largely from the country's secular middle class, while Netanyahu's supporters tend to be poorer, more religious and live in West Bank settlements or outlying rural areas.\nIsraeli security forces detain a demonstrator near Israel's parliament in Jerusalem on Monday when protesters denounced the government's judicial overhaul. \n \n(Hazem Bader/AFP/Getty Images)\nMany of his supporters are Mizrahi Jews, with roots in Middle Eastern countries, and have expressed hostility toward what they say is an elitist class of Ashkenazi or European, Jews.\nOn the eve of the vote, tens of thousands of people gathered for mass rallies for and against the plan. Netanyahu's supporters late Sunday\u00a0thronged central Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0normally the setting for anti-government protests \u2014\u00a0while his opponents converged on Jerusalem ahead of Monday's vote.\nDespite the attempts to project business as usual, Netanyahu's schedule was disrupted by his hospitalization, with a cabinet meeting and trips postponed.\nNetanyahu paused the overhaul in March after intense pressure by protesters and labour strikes that halted outgoing flights and shut down parts of the economy. After talks to find a compromise failed last month, he said his government was pressing on with the overhaul.",

        "content": "A jury on Tuesday found six people guilty of terrorist murder for extremist attacks in Brussels in 2016 that killed 32 people and were claimed by the Islamic State group, in Belgium's deadliest peacetime violence, according to Belgian media.\nAmong those convicted for their role in the suicide bombings at Brussels' airport and a subway station was \nSalah Abdeslam\n, who already is serving a life sentence without parole in France over his role in attacks that hit Paris cafes, the Bataclan theater and France's national stadium in 2015.\nThe verdict was reported by public broadcaster RTBF, newspaper Le Soir and news websites HLN and Nieuwsblad.\nThe chief judge read out the verdict and explanations by the 12-person jury, who made a clear connection to IS and its extremist ideology. The reading of the verdict was expected to take a few hours. Sentencing will be decided in a separate process, not before September.\nIn addition to the six people convicted of terrorist murder, four others on trial were acquitted or facing other charges.\nSurvivors hope to 'turn the page'\nThe biggest trial in Belgium's judicial history unfolded over seven months in a special court to address the exceptional case. Survivors and families of victims hoped the trial and verdict would help them work through what happened and find closure.\nThe morning rush hour attacks on March 22, 2016 at Zavantem Airport and on the Brussels subway's central commuter line deeply shook the city, which is home to the headquarters of the European Union and NATO, and put the country on edge. In addition to the 32 people killed, nearly 900 others were wounded or suffered serious mental trauma.\nBroken windows are seen at the scene of explosions at Zaventem Airport near Brussels in March 2016. \n \n(Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images)\nJamila Adda, president of the Life4Bruxelles victims' association, gathered a group of survivors at the special courthouse to hear Tuesday's verdict. Among them was a man named Frederic, who said the \"atrocious crimes\" of March 22 still haunt him.\n\"We have been waiting for this for seven years, seven years that weighed heavily on the victims. ... We are waiting with impatience, and with some anguish\" for the verdict, he told The Associated Press. Frederic, among the commuters who survived the attack at the Maelbeek metro station, spoke on condition that his last name not be published to protect his identity as a victim of trauma.\nSurvivors have supported each other through the proceedings, some coming every day. \"It is important to be together, to hear the decision of justice,\" Frederic said. And then, they hope \"to be able to turn the page.\"\nSome face up to 30 years in prison\nThe 12 jurors had been deliberating since early July over some 300 questions the court asked them to consider before reaching a verdict. Tuesday's expected decision will address whether or not each of the suspects is guilty of various charges. and may take several hours to be read out.\nEventual sentencing will be decided in a separate process. If convicted, some could face up to 30 years in prison.\nBrussels bombings: Montreal actress Salom\u00e9 Corbo caught in airport attack\nNova Scotian in Brussels reflects on the bombing attacks\nAbdeslam was the only survivor among the Islamic State extremists who struck Paris in November 2015 and were part of a Franco-Belgian network that went on to target Brussels four months later. After months on the run following the Paris attacks, Abdeslam was captured in Brussels on March 18, 2016, and his arrest may have prompted other members of the IS cell to rush ahead with attack plans on the Belgian capital.\nAlso convicted of terrorist murder at the trial in Brussels was Mohamed Abrini, childhood friend of Abdeslam and a Brussels native who walked away from Zaventem airport after his explosives failed to detonate.\nOussama Atar, who has been identified as a possible organizer of the deadly attacks on both Paris and Brussels, was convicted of terrorist murder in absentia. He is believed to have died in the Islamic State group's final months of fighting in Iraq and Syria.",

        "content": "On a hot day, you can still get a workout with a brisk walk, rather than a full on jog, says David Behm.\n \n(seyomedo/Shutterstock)\nIt's turning out to be a hot summer in Newfoundland and Labrador and while people want to get outside while they can, there are good reasons to\u00a0exercise safely \u2014 and reasons\u00a0why many in the province\u00a0want to tap out at 30 degrees.\nDavid Behm, a professor at Memorial University's School of Human Kinetics and Recreation, said this heat can be\u00a0dangerous because we're not used to it and don't get the chance to get used to it.\n\"It's very tough to do that in Newfoundland because you know we only have like a week of 28, 29 degree weather. We're not going to get acclimatized,\" he told CBC News.\nBehm explained people have heat stress proteins that allow people to operate better in the heat.\n\"So\u00a0even just exercising \u2014 even if it's not on a hot day \u2014 your core temperature goes up. You develop these heat stress proteins and they protect your enzymes.\"\nEnzymes are involved in energy processing but if they break down, the body can't process energy. He added that a fever of 42 degrees is dangerous because enzymes break down at that temperature, which means the brain isn't working.\nBut there are people living in 30 degree temperatures just fine because they've developed heat stress proteins, he said.\n\"If you exercise\u2014even if it's not in really hot environments\u2014your core temperature goes up. You get more heat stress proteins. You can handle heat better and then your body learns how to sweat better and thermal regulate better,\" said Behm.\nYou can condition your body to deal with hotter temperatures, though he said it can be difficult for people in this province to build up their acclimation when there isn't a lot of heat to deal with.\n\"But just exercising in a normal environment will help to build up those heat stress proteins.\"\nPollution, masking up and kids safety\nWhen it comes to pollution in the air, there are considerations you have to make around being active. Behm said if he was in Beijing he would recommend exercising indoors rather than outdoors.\n\"We need to exercise for our health. But when we have situations where\u2014again as a Newfoundlander and it's 32 degrees out or the humidex feels like it's 38 degrees\u2014you shouldn't be outside exercising because you're not used to it.\"\u00a0\nDavid Behm cautions people against exercising outdoors if the conditions aren't right, included pollution concerns. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh\n \n(The Canadian Press)\nBehm\u00a0cautions\u00a0that\u00a0doing so could end up causing\u00a0problems because your enzymes are breaking down. So on those hot days he would advise exercising inside where there's AC.\n\"And then when we've got those 25 degree days, those 22 degree days, I want to be outside and taking advantage of the good clean Newfoundland air and the beautiful weather,\" said Behm.\nHe said you can exercise once a week and maintain your gains. And if the forecast says for the next two weeks it will be hot weather, then you can workout indoors. But he said\u00a0exercising once a week\u00a0can still help you stay fit.\n\"It's not going to fall off the face of the earth just because you didn't exercise three to five times this week.\"\nBehm also had advice on keeping kids safe in higher temperatures. While as adults we might dedicate a certain time and intensity to running, he said kids don't work that way.\n\"Kids will run around for 10 or 15 seconds and then they'll stop and then they'll sprint for another 20 seconds and they'll stop. They do a lot of intermittent activity.\"\nIntermittent activity allows their bodies to recover, he said. But they also don't sweat as much as adults do, which can be dangerous in the heat.\nDavid Behm says kids tend toward intermittent activity, unlike adults.\n \n(Colleen Underwood/CBC)\nIf people want to wear masks white they're active he said most research concludes that wearing a mask doesn't affect performance.\n\"It's going to decrease that convection. You're not going to have as much air moving around your face, and you're probably going to feel a little less comfortable. But you can still exercise at the same intensity as you did without the mask.\"\nAlso when it's humid outside, he said you don't have to go as hard as you normally do on your exercise routine. If you typically run, you can opt for a brisk walk.\n\"If you're an athlete, you may not be really improving but you're not losing. And then as the average individual, you know, you just want to stay healthy. And you're going to be healthy if you just move once or twice a day at low intensity rather than overheating yourself.\"\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",

        "content": "Wreckhouse News editor-in-chief Ren\u00e9 Roy says Brook Hill, a gravel road, was undergoing upgrades but is now dangerous to travel due to rain damage.\n \n(Submitted by Ren\u00e9 Roy )\nPeople\u00a0taking inventory of rainfall damages in the town of Channel-Port aux Basques say it hasn't been nearly as bad as initially feared.\nRainfall warnings have been in effect for Newfoundland's southwest coast since Friday, with heavy rain beginning Saturday and at one time up to 150 millimetres predicted. Warnings remain in effect overnight for the Burgeo-Ramea area. It's the tail end of the same system that\u00a0\nhit Nova Scotia with unprecedented rainfall\n\u00a0just days before.\n\"We've had a fair amount of rain. I think some reports are saying that we've had over 100 millimetres of rain thus far,\" Channel-Port aux Basques Mayor Brian Button told CBC News.\n\"I guess the biggest issue that we're having in town is that we have some ongoing construction that is happening in town.\"\nThe area around Brook Hill is a gravel road that been torn up for infrastructure updates. Due to heavy rains they've been seeing runoff, Button explained.\n\"That's making the road in deplorable shape, especially for the residents living there. I know it's got to be frustrating and it's equally frustrating for us, but it's kind of something that's out of our control,\" said Button.\nTallying damage\nWreckhouse News editor-in-chief Ren\u00e9 Roy says it could have been worse, especially when compared with what's happening in Nova Scotia.\n\"We've had some moderate sheets of rain come down, but it really hasn't lasted for like an hour or that kind of thing,\" said Roy. \"It's quite overcast with a lot of rumbling thunder, but you know, I could go for a walk right now if I wanted to.\"\nWash out on Brook Hill in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PortauxBasques?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PortauxBasques</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/newfoundland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#newfoundland</a> this evening <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nlwx?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#nlwx</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/A0AkJy7XKc\">pic.twitter.com/A0AkJy7XKc</a>\n&mdash;\n@WreckhousePress\nButton said they are getting reports of localized basement flooding\u00a0but they're fortunately not getting the extreme damage that Nova Scotia has had.\n\"But that's no consolation for those residents that may be getting flooding at this time, which makes it very difficult for them. It seems like it's been an ongoing thing and it's becoming very, very frustrating for all involved,\" said Button.\nRoy said he's sure there are instances of people's basements flooding when sump pumps failed. He has heard of a couple of roads that are compromised, like Gullages Lane, and advised people not to drive up that road.\n\"But for the most part I think we've gotten away really, really well,\" said Roy. \"I haven't personally experienced a lot of worry in this storm that, you know, you might have experienced in [post-tropical storm] Fiona.\"\nA stretch to highway has been reduced to just one lane.\n \n(Submitted by Ren\u00e9 Roy)\nAccess to rest of province\nButton said three lanes of the four-lane highway are closed. If the highway\u00a0closes, he added, the town will\u00a0be cut off from the rest of the province, which would impact the community on a number of levels such as health care, he added.\n\"Rains are still coming down. So it is very concerning at this time.\"\nMoreover, the rainfall is compounding road problems the area already had, he said. A year and a half ago there was a major washout that resulted in a section of the Trans-Canada Highway being cut off in four locations.\n\"It just seems like we're late off the mark getting work done and that needs to be improved,\" said Button.\n\"Rain events are happening more often and it seems like the days of getting 10, 20 millimetres of rain seems to be a thing of the past. It seems that we're always up to 50 to 100 to 100 plus and that becomes very worrisome and knowing if our systems can handle it.\"\nCaution around washouts\nButton added there have been reports of trailway washouts, such as\u00a0the Osmond Point area and McDougall's area.\nHe is asking anyone travelling along those trails to proceed with caution. Railbeds are also closed in certain sections, he said, including the\u00a0Cheeseman Provincial Park down to Port aux Basques.\nButton also encouraged people to report washouts by posting online or directly to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",

Seawater has entered the engine compartment, causing damage to the pipes and increasing the risk of sinking, according to internal documents obtained by The Associated Press in June 2020.\nInternational effort\nFor years, the UN\u00a0and governments of other countries as well as environmental groups have warned that if an oil spill \u2014 or explosion \u2014 occurs, it could disrupt global commercial shipping,\u00a0causing untold damage to the global economy.\nIn total, the Safer salvage operation is expected to cost\u00a0about $144 million US\u00a0\u2014 an estimate\u00a0that also includes finding a permanent storage solution for the oil.

So it's an artwork that has functionality as well.\"\nThey are also durable because they're made from natural material. The dyes are derived from vegetables, roots or plants, said Hosseini. The rugs can also be repaired and reused, he added.\nSome of the rugs in their collection are more than 100 years old.\n \n(Heather Barrett)\n\"You can use them as a normal rug. You can have them in your area, everywhere that you want. And the good thing about the hand knitted rugs are\u2026 very durable,\" Vaziri said.\nShe pointed to a rug in the collection that is almost 100-years-old in good condition.\n\"You just need to be careful about them. Don't use chemical things for washing them. And yeah, they can last for, like, ever.\"\nThere will often be a designer who sets out a pattern that the weavers then follow, but he said that's not always the case.\n\"We have some other rugs from villages or from nomads and they are woven by memory.\"\nMaking a connection through rugs\nHosseini said Vaziri's father is a rug collector and her uncle has a rug store in Iran, which gave them an introduction to this business. When they moved to this province, they didn't see any rug collectors in the area and saw a gap in the market they could fill with Rug the Rock.\nIt was also a way to connect with society here, said Hosseini, and one enjoyable part of the business is hunting down the rugs and curating them.\nWeekend AM\n10:54\nRug the Rock\nHanif Hosseini and Ellie Vaziri of Rug the Rock display some of their one of a kind, hand made rugs from the Middle East.\n\"The best part of this job is to find like-minded people. People that appreciate art and\u2026 we really learn a lot from other people. We've met so many great artists, local artists or even international artists only because of this business.\"\nThey have put their rugs on display for prospective buyers and on Saturday showcased 70 of their unique rugs at their home.\nVaziri said her favourite rug is a pinkish-coloured Kurdish rug.\n\"I love this rug because of its pattern and the pattern is simple and geometric,\" she said. \"We don't see this colours so much on Persian rugs. They are usually\u2026 a deep red as you can see but this one is very soft.\"\nHanif Hosseini said it can take a group of weavers several years to make one rug.\n \n(Heather Barrett)\nHosseini said one of his favourite rugs is from a remote area of Morocco.\n\"And no one knows the story of this pattern. It's woven by a woman because in that area only women [weave]. You can see the pattern is very complicated because they show their social level by their weaving techniques.\"\n\"Because they don't express themselves by talking to their husbands or society. They usually express themselves by telling your story, by weaving that no one knows about.\"\nRead more articles from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",

        "content": "Hundreds of St. John's residents participated in the funeral procession of Gerald J. Whitty and William King, local veterans of the First World War, after they were killed by a speeding car in Donovans in September 1924.\n \n(The Rooms/Public domain)\nIt's a tale of two funerals.\nSpring 2018, Corner Brook, N.L.: As we leave my grandmother's funeral, other drivers yield to our procession, even stopping on a green light to let us through so we aren't separated. We reach the cemetery together to bear the casket into a receiving chapel for a final farewell.\nSpring 2023, St. John's: Leaving my cousins' grandmother's funeral, the hearse is immediately cut off from mourners by a courier van barrelling down the quiet side street. Despite our blinking emergency lights, the procession is interrupted by car after car, and we ultimately arrive at the cemetery by ones and twos, as though we had travelled separately.\nThe funeral cortege is a dying tradition, especially in larger centres where traffic is heavier and there's a higher proportion of young drivers unfamiliar with the tradition of yielding to them.\nCritics say we'd be better off without processions, which delay transit and occasionally even lead to accidents. Is there still a place for solemn, intimate customs like this one in our increasingly fast-paced and impersonal society?\nFuneral processions have existed throughout recorded history. They emerged independently in many different parts of the world, for purely practical reasons.\nAn Egyptian widow weeps beside her husband\u2019s coffin, kohl eyeliner running down her cheeks, while male relatives and colleagues follow behind the funeral sledge. \n \n(The British Museum/Public domain)\nWhen a person dies, their remains must be transported from the location of their death to a place where their body can be prepared, then onward to their final resting place. Sometimes there's a stop at a ceremonial space like a church or a temple along the way.\nSince death is a social event \u2014 one that engages family, friends\u00a0and community in commemorating the loss \u2014 it's natural that the people who gather to honour the deceased should also accompany the corpse on its last journey.\nA \n4,000-year-old lament\n from Mesopotamia describes a king's funeral. Weeping soldiers escorted his body to its grave, where his donkeys and chariot were buried with him to carry him the rest of the way to the netherworld.\nUpper-class Egyptian funeral corteges included family members, priests, servants and sometimes musicians or professional mourners. The Tale of Sinuhe (ca. 1900-1700 BC) vividly depicts the trip to the tomb from the corpse's perspective (\ntranslation by Roland Enmarch\n):\n\"A funeral procession will be made for you on the day of joining the earth\u00a0with a mummy case of gold, a mask of lapis lazuli, a heaven over you, and you placed in a hearse, with oxen dragging you, and singers before you.\"\nAn ordinary person might not have a golden casket, but in most places they would have the dignity of some sort of procession. Their body might be carried on the shoulders of loved ones or pulled to the gravesite on a wheeled bier followed by neighbours and friends on foot.\nOjibwe mourners bear a community member, along with food and personal belongings, to a burial scaffold. Engraving after B. Picart, 1723.\n \n(Archives de Montr\u00e9al/Public domain)\nIn rural communities, the distance from the deceased's home to a cremation site or burial ground was usually short, but larger centres often required cemeteries to be located outside city limits for sanitary reasons or to preserve space for housing, making them difficult to reach on foot.\nAs a result, motor vehicles were incorporated into funeral processions almost as soon as they became widely available.\nIn 1908, the first car affordable to the middle class, the Ford Model T, was brought to market in the United States, and the first gas-powered \"auto hearses\" were introduced just a year later.\nAs car ownership became more and more common over the course of the 20th century, vehicular processions became the norm for funerals in many parts of the world, giving rise to new etiquette.\nParticipants in the cortege would drive slowly to mimic the sombre pace of a funeral march, and other drivers would usually give them the right of way.\nThese courtesies, however, weren't always enshrined in law.\nEighteenth-century Chinese wallpaper shows a funeral procession led by musicians.\n \n(The Deutsches Tapetenmuseum/Public domain.)\nMost provinces and territories allow cars in corteges to travel closer together than other vehicles, but only five \u2014 Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Yukon \u2014 actually prohibit other drivers from cutting in.\nAs for running red lights and stop signs, that's allowed only under certain circumstances in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Yukon, while \nP.E.I. is the lone province\n with a law requiring other drivers to slow down when approaching a cortege.\nWhile they may have little legal protection, funeral processions can have a big emotional impact.\nI had never given much thought to funeral processions until I was in one and found it comforting to see other drivers slow down or stop. After all, when someone we love dies, doesn't it feel like the world should stop, if only for a moment?\nThose brief gestures of respect not only communicate sympathy and mutual support, they acknowledge that the deceased was part of the fabric of the community. Drivers might not know who's in the casket but may nonetheless feel the gap they leave behind \u2014 the regular customer who no longer pops into their coffee shop, the neighbour who no longer pets their dog, the receptionist who no longer answers their call.\nIn a culture where we're more and more insulated from death, it's also an opportunity for drivers to reflect on their own mortality. It's a \nmemento mori\n, a reminder that we and our loved ones will soon be making that final journey ourselves and that we should live our lives with the knowledge they will not last forever.\nDiverse, urban societies are bound by few common rituals. The funeral procession cuts across cultural and religious lines and allows us to recognize our common humanity.\nIsn't that worth a moment's pause?\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",

Ever since, they say, their business has taken off.\n \n(Henrike Wilhelm/CBC)\nAnyone visiting the Placentia\u00a0area on a weekday is hard-pressed to miss Ray and Jake Griffiths at the Wiener Wagon.\nSet up next to mascot Big Willy, a giant inflatable hotdog, the father-son duo spends their days, alternating between\u00a0Placentia and neighbouring Argentia,\u00a0selling\u00a0hotdogs, fries and more at their food cart.\u00a0\nWhat sounds like a normal business venture is much more to the pair\u00a0\u2014 it's a way of helping Jake, who has Asperger's syndrome, train his social skills while having\u00a0meaningful employment.\n\"He was finding it difficult to find work,\" said father Ray Griffiths.\n\"I\u00a0seen this cart for sale up in Stanhope and I said to him\u00a0\u2026 'Maybe we can get it for a half decent price and then you can become your own boss.' And that's what happened.\"\nThat was in January 2020. Four months later, the Wiener Wagon opened for business.\nFor Jake, cooking has not just always been a part of his relationship with his father;\u00a0he also received his cooking diploma\u00a0from\u00a0Academy Canada in 2019.\n86% of adults with autism are unemployed. This job fair aims to change that\n\"For as long as I can remember, me and Dad, we usually did a lot of baking experiments when I was but a young kid. We would make cupcakes, we baked bread, we made \u2026\u00a0pigs in a blanket,\" he said.\n\"At first, I thought maybe [I'd] just become a pastry chef. But then I decided, why stick with the one thing when you could just do both?\u00a0So\u00a0I took the cooking class, I graduated and here we are. It's not as fancy as those other restaurants\u00a0but I like to think it's good for me.\"\nEven though the decision to buy the cart, said Ray, was made right before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down many businesses across the province, father and son decided to open anyway \u2014 a\u00a0leap of faith that worked out, as their business was set up perfectly for physical\u00a0distancing.\n\"People would stop by the road, honk their horn, put in their order. We'd bring it out to their car, they'd pay through just slipping the money into the window,\" said Ray. \"We had a phenomenal year. And it just took off from there.\"\n\"We've been getting more and more events. And honestly, I'm astounded by how big this has become,\" Jake added.\nJake Griffiths has always bonded with his father over cooking. In preparation for the Wiener Wagon, he completed a cooking course at Academy Canada.\n \n(Henrike Wilhelm/CBC)\nNow more and more events knock\u00a0on the door, and the Wiener Wagon\u00a0is booked out for weekends until the end of September.\nAs Jake\u00a0requires\u00a0help in some areas, Ray arranged for some support from\u00a0a company that helps people with disabilities find employment, for some past events. This summer though, he decided to take time off work to join Jake himself.\n\"This way, he could be his own boss. He can do his own thing and he's got someone there to guide him and keep him on track,\" said Ray.\n\"He struggles in\u00a0some areas but \u2026\u00a0speaking is not one of them. And he's a good cook.\"\nFor Jake, the hotdog cart isn't his first business \u2014 at the age of 12, he started a jewelry business,\u00a0selling his products at\u00a0markets with the goal of\u00a0improving his social skills.\nThe\u00a0interactions with customers are now Jake's favourite\u00a0part of running the Wiener Wagon.\nRay and Jake Griffiths can be found in either Placentia or Argentia on alternating weekdays, and at events on the weekends. This year, they're booked up until September, says Ray Griffiths.\n \n(Henrike Wilhelm/CBC)\n\"I think it's a pretty big achievement for me. I mean, I don't consider myself a special little snowflake or anything. I consider myself the average Joe,\" he said.\n\"But yeah, I think it's pretty good. Get to exercise my skills and get to meet people and keeps me busy.\"\nWithin the next three years, Ray plans on retiring and turning his full attention to the\u00a0Wiener Wagon \u2014 with their sights set on adding a second cart.\n\"It's hard to be in two places at once. Obviously,\u00a0we can't. And we've turned down some big jobs because of it, so there's potential there for more,\" said Ray.\n\"Then, I can get [Jake]\u00a0a coach to go with him and I'll venture off in another direction.\"\nOn Wednesdays and Fridays, Ray and Jake Griffiths are set up next to the main road in Placentia.\n \n(Henrike Wilhelm/CBC)\nIt's an opportunity\u00a0Jake is grateful for.\n\"I just want to thank my dad for helping me out with this. He's been a big help,\" he said, his arm around his father's shoulder.\nRay laughed.\n\"Life is short. Eat the Wiener,\" he said.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",

        "content": "Family members of a 14-year-old girl who was the subject of an Amber Alert last month say they repeatedly warned authorities that Wilbur Crockwell, 72, was luring her over a period of about four years.\nThe girl cannot be identified due to a court-ordered publication ban. Her family, by extension, also cannot be named.\nHer mother said she told police everything as soon as her daughter was reported missing on June 2.\n\"I knew Will was involved from the beginning,\" she said. \"I told them,\u00a0'He's the one you need to be looking for.'\"\nCrockwell, through his lawyer, declined to comment on each of the allegations set forth in this story. He made bail on June 22\u00a0and has returned to New Brunswick.\nRelationship turns bad\nCrockwell and the mother were in a relationship and lived together in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2019-20.\nThe mother said police came to her door on the first night they moved into a small town on the Avalon Peninsula, after Crockwell and her daughter went out to get supplies. She said an officer told her someone had called after seeing them acting inappropriately in public.\n\"They both denied that it happened \u2026 and then the officers left and left it at that,\" she said. \"I can feel what I want to feel, right? But to prove it was actually happening was different.\"\nThe woman says she told social workers with Newfoundland and Labrador's child protection system about her suspicions on multiple occasions. She said it came to a head when they threatened to take the girl into their custody if Crockwell didn't move out.\nHer version was backed up by evidence presented at Crockwell's bail hearing. Crown prosecutor Mike Murray read in a statement from a social worker connected to the case, who said they had a \"safety plan\" in place for a short period of time, during which Crockwell was out of the house.\nDuring that time, the girl went to live with her father in New Brunswick. His side of the family told CBC News they had deep concerns about how she continued to speak and meet with Crockwell, despite the interventions of the child protection system.\nOne aunt said she called the RCMP in New Brunswick at least three times, after finding Crockwell with the girl when she said she was at a friend's house. She said the RCMP referred the matter to social services in New Brunswick after the last time she called.\nThe RCMP in New Brunswick declined comment, saying they can't speak about investigations that\u00a0don't result in charges.\nThe girl's father died in December. She moved in with her aunt next door while the family figured out next steps. The aunt said Crockwell was paying for the girl's phone and sending her money in the days she was under her roof.\nAn agreement was made that the girl would move back to Newfoundland with her mother, who was no longer with Crockwell. She said he continued to contact her daughter, despite being in a different province and despite her insisting he stop.\nCrown's case against Crockwell\nCrockwell was arrested\u00a0June 8, after an Amber Alert was issued. According to the Crown prosecutor, the girl was found with two adults, 63-year-old Erin Bast\u00a0and 69-year-old Cyril Boone, at their cabin on Bay d'Espoir Highway.\nBast and Boone were released from custody, but Crown prosecutor Mike Murray opposed Crockwell's release and a bail hearing was ordered. All evidence from bail hearings is normally covered by a publication ban;\u00a0however, neither the prosecution nor defence requested a ban.\nMurray began by reading in Crockwell's criminal record, which spans the 1960s\u00a0to 1996. The most serious offences include\u00a0assault, forcible confinement and escaping custody. He also read out a list of several aliases used during Crockwell's life.\nLawyer Bob Buckingham speaks with his client, Wilbur Crockwell, during a court appearance on June 16.\n \n(Ryan Cooke/CBC)\nHe then read in detailed reports from police and social workers about how they worked the case and came to the conclusion it was Crockwell she was going to meet.\nThe court heard the girl left on the morning of June 2 with a hockey bag in tow, heading for\u00a0the Avalon Mall. She was reported missing later that day.\nThe girl's younger sister told police she believed the girl was going to meet Crockwell, who was often described as her stepfather. The court heard the younger sister told police she believed they had \"an inappropriate relationship\" and that Crockwell gave the girl money for drugs.\nCrockwell spoke with police soon afterward and told them he had text messages showing the girl didn't want to stay in Newfoundland any longer, but denied knowing where she was.\nFootage obtained from CCTV cameras at the Avalon Mall showed the girl getting into a car with two men and one woman.\u00a0\nOn June 7, police were tipped off by an acquaintance of Crockwell's in New Brunswick who had given him $1,000 to get the ferry to Newfoundland. He arrived in Port aux Basques the following morning.\nMurray said police listened in on a phone call between Bast and Crockwell soon after the Amber Alert went out on June 8.\n\"We're kidnappers, Will,\" she reportedly told Crockwell, while demanding he get the girl that night, and get her out of their cabin. Murray said Crockwell tried to assure her it was OK, referring to the text messages about her desire to leave the province.\nThe RCMP followed Crockwell across the island\u00a0and arrested him in Badger after he was \"driving fast and erratically,\" according to statements read in court.\nJudge Lois Skanes said she found the Crown's case to be compelling but \"not unassailable,\" according to reporting by the St. John's Telegram.\u00a0\nSkanes granted bail and allowed Crockwell to return to New Brunswick\u00a0but ordered him to abide by strict conditions. He must go to the nearest police station every day to check in, and he can have no contact with the girl or her family. He also has to close their shared bank account and is banned from paying for her cellphone.\nThe girl's mother says she hopes the court will eventually put an end to the situation.\n\"Everybody [in the family] has been trying to protect her, but nobody has been listening,\" the mother said. \"You need to step up to the plate and do something. Find some resources, find something to stop this.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",

It's the same school where NHL superstars Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon\u00a0played their 15-year-old seasons.\n\"It was an adjustment at first being away from home and being in a different country,\" she said.\u00a0\"But the hockey is just so competitive, and I made a lot of great friends in my first year and I'm excited to go back in the fall.\"\nNewhook, meanwhile, dominated for Boston College in her sophomore season.

        "content": "A rescue and recovery dive team was deployed Saturday after a helicopter with a pilot and three state workers crashed in a large lake on Alaska's North Slope, officials said.\nNo survivors have been located.\n\"The official word is, they are missing, presumed fatal,\" said Clint Johnson, the chief of the National Transportation Safety Board's Alaska region.\nAn NTSB investigator was also en route to the accident scene Saturday as plans were being made to recover the wreckage from the water, he said. Challenges with the lake crash site and the availability of another helicopter in the area likely mean the aircraft won't be raised from the middle of the shallow, 1.6-kilometre-wide\u00a0lake until Monday or Tuesday, Johnson said.\u00a0\nThe downed helicopter had been chartered by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, the department said in a statement Friday. It was carrying three employees from the Division of Geological and Geophysical Survey who had been conducting field work.\n\"DNR is praying for our employees and the pilot, their families, and the DNR team,\" the statement said. \"We are continuing to await updates from the search and rescue effort.\"\nNatural Resources Commissioner John Boyle flew to the crash site Friday night with a North Slope Search and Rescue spotter ahead of the recovery operation, said Lorraine Henry, a spokesperson for the state agency.\nDebris found\nThe Bell 206 helicopter was reported overdue Thursday night. A North Slope Borough search and rescue team in a helicopter found debris matching the description of the missing helicopter, D.J. Fauske, the borough's director of government and external affairs, said in a text to The Associated Press on Friday.\nFauske did not immediately respond to a list of questions sent to him by email Saturday.\nThe helicopter's wreckage was found in the lake near Wainwright, which is about 80 kilometres\u00a0south of Utqiagvik, the northernmost city in the U.S., formerly known as Barrow.\nJohnson said because of where the helicopter came to rest, in the middle of the lake, they will have to use another helicopter to pull it out.\u00a0\n\"This is going to be a helicopter recovery, no ifs, no ands, no buts, out in the middle of no place,\" he said. That location, hundreds of miles north of Anchorage, also means helicopters are hard to come by.\n\"The helicopters up here are at an absolute premium,\" he said.\nHelicopter flight originated in Utqiagvik\nAlso complicating matters is that from the photographs he's seen of the submerged helicopter, it's in fragments, Johnson said.\nThe North Slope Borough requested that the Alaska State Troopers activate the Alaska Dive Search, Rescue and Recovery Team, troopers spokesperson Austin McDaniel said in an email to The Associated Press.\nThe team was en route Saturday to Utqiagvik, located on the coast of the Arctic Ocean about 720 miles (1,159 kilometres) northwest of Anchorage. The borough is the primary agency coordinating efforts at the crash site, McDaniel said.\nThe helicopter flight originated in Utqiagvik and was supposed to return there, Johnson said, adding other details of the flight were not immediately available.\nThe helicopter was operated by Maritime Helicopters Inc., according to a statement on the company's website. It confirmed the accident was fatal and said names of the pilot and passengers would be released pending notification of next of kin.",

        "summary": "The battle to manage the invasion of nuisance plants in the North is ongoing, but one Yukon University master's student may have found a purpose for some pesky and resilient weeds.\u00a0",
        "content": "The battle to manage the invasion of nuisance plants in the North is ongoing, but one Yukon University master's student may have found a purpose for some pesky and resilient weeds.\u00a0\nTaylor Belansky, with the university's Northern Mine Remediation team, studies how to mitigate the environmental impacts of mining. Her thesis research aims to find a way to support the growth of bacteria that converts nitrate, often found at mine sites, into nitrogen.\u00a0\nShe says feeding that bacteria is one way to filter mine-impacted water. With the support of her research advisor, Guillaume Nielsen, Belansky tested carbon sources including\u00a0wood chips, compost, grains from Yukon Brewing, molasses and invasive plants such as\u00a0foxtail barley and white sweet clover. The student researcher was amazed by the results, finding white sweet clover, a usually undesired weed, was the most effective food source.\u00a0\n\"It's really cool that we tried it because the white sweet clover is readily found at mine sites,\" she said. \"Nature has the answer to these contaminants that we're putting into the environment. We just have to find out how best to help those natural processes along.\"\nBelansky says mine blasts often results in incomplete combustion of blasting fuel, leaving behind high concentrations of nitrate residue that can leech into waterways and harm aquatic ecosystems. A process called eutrophication\u00a0causes algae blooms and poses a risk to the health of fish, as it can suffocate them.\n\"Nitrate is naturally occurring. The poison is in the dose. So, nitrate is naturally out there, but when it's in low concentrations, the plants are using it,\" Belansky explained. \"It's when we're putting in too much that\u00a0it overwhelms the system, especially aquatics systems.\"\nSweet clover is the most common invasive plant species in the Yukon. Belansky found it was also the most effective food source for the nitrogen-creating bacteria. \n \n(Yukon Invasive Species Council)\nLori Fox, the summer outreach coordinator with the Yukon Invasive Species Council, says white sweet clover is unyielding, popping up through soil and gravel to colonize. Initially transported to the Yukon for agriculture purposes, Fox says it chokes out native plant species due to its nitrogen-fixing nature, as many of Yukon's native plants prefer a lower-nitrogen environment.\u00a0\n\"It wasn't originally supposed to escape,\" Fox said during an interview with CBC's\u00a0\nYukon Morning\n host, Elyn Jones. \"But like many invasive species, it did and you see it all over the place.\"\nThe issue with sweet clover and other invasive species\u00a0is that they\u00a0alter\u00a0biodiversity and change\u00a0where animals can find their food, says Fox.\n\"It has the potential to really alter the landscape,\" Fox\u00a0said. \"Even if we can't stop what is in place\u2026in many cases that's impossible, we have a responsibility to mitigate.\"\nTyler Obediah, natural resource coordinator with Carcross/Tagish First Nation, says the changing landscape is illustrated by decreasing fireweed populations.\nFireweed is being crowded out by sweet clover in some parts of the Yukon.\n \n(Paul Tukker/CBC)\nFireweed is native to the North and used traditionally by First Nations communities as a food source for its richness in vitamins A and C. Obediah says the purple plant, often found in the same dusty and disturbed soil as white sweet clover, is often cooked in butter, eaten raw or pickled.\u00a0Given its medicinal properties, fireweed is also often used to make salves, lotions, and tea.\n\"For a lot of First Nations it's important to maintain that relationship with the plants,\" he said. \"It's a deep cultural connection to the earth and to everything that's around us. It's very important in a lot of ways.\"\nDespite its myriad of uses, Obediah says fireweed is becoming increasingly difficult to find, as the white clover crowds out the native plant.\n'For a lot of First Nations it's important to maintain that relationship with the plants,' said Tyler Obediah, natural resource coordinator with Carcross/Tagish First Nation.\n \n(Submitted by Tyler Obediah)\nGiven its unwelcome habitation, Belansky says she's pleased to find a purpose for the vexing weed.\n\"We're killing two birds with one stone here,\" she said. \"We're not intentionally letting it grow. We don't want it to further invade the mine site. We actually want to remove it from the mine site and put it to use.\"\nThe next step in Belansky's research will take her findings outside the lab to the Minto mine site in central Yukon. She says she will use \"bioreactors\" \u2014 55-gallon drums \u2014 to filter mine-impacted water and see how the bacteria, fed with white sweet clover, cope\u00a0with changing water chemistry, conditions and temperatures.\u00a0\nHealing the land, 1 tree at a time: Kaska lead revegetation project at Yukon's Faro Mine\nBelansky expects to complete her research and publish her findings in December and is eager to see what her research yields.\u00a0\n\"Knowing the impact mining has had on the environment, I just wanted to be a part of more solutions.\"",

On Saturday's, children would play in a nearby park while parents and other patrons sat on a grassy lawn, eating plates of locally-made food.\nIt's something St. John's residents Tracey and Robert Mills remember fondly. Their children were babies when the farmers' market opened, and the couple has tried to pop by every Saturday since.\nTracey and Robert Mills try to visit the farmers' market every Saturday. They remember when the market was located at the Lions Club off Bonaventure Avenue, and say visiting has become a tradition.\n \n(Jessica Singer/CBC)\n\"It's a regular Saturday tradition,\" said Robert.\n\"It feels like a true community,\" said Tracey. \"Everyone's just so happy to be here and enthusiastic about what they're doing.\"\nEmily Hunt, also known by many in the St. John's community as The Waffle Lady, was one of the market's original vendors. Although the market lost its outdoor space in 2017 when it moved to its current location, the former Metrobus building on Freshwater road, she says it hasn't lost it's intimate spirit.\n\"One thing that hasn't changed is the community support,\" said Hunt. \"That's always been amazing.\"\nSupport for new Canadians\nAlong with supporting local businesses, Greene says something that makes the St. John's Farmers' Market so special is the assistance it provides to new Canadians.\nNezar Khalif moved from Syria to Newfoundland and Labrador almost 8 years ago. He's a farmer with Murray Meadows Farm in Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, and has been selling vegetables and other locally-grown produce at the market for three years.\nHe says it's a place where he can meet new friends, as well as improve his English speaking skills.\nSalaheldin Bilila is the owner of a small business called Arabesque that sells his desserts, including his favourite cake dish, Basbosa. He moved to the province from Egypt a year and a half ago, and says he is one of the newest vendors at the St. John's Farmers' Market.\n \n(Jessica Singer/CBC)\nSalaheldin Bilila says he's one of the newest members to join\u00a0the farmers' market family, as Saturday's anniversary was only his second gig as a vendor.\nWhen he moved to the province from Egypt a year and a half ago, he realized no stores sold his favourite cake dessert, basbosa. He previously made the dessert for friends and family, but decided to turn\u00a0his passion for baking into a small business called Arabesque, which opened in March.\nThe market is a great way to introduce people to Egyptian culture, says Bilila, and he hopes the market can help his passion project become something bigger.\n\"I'm excited to be a part of this amazing family,\" said Bilila.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador",

        "content": "The owners of the Village Bakery and Deli in Haines Junction, Yukon,\u00a0are defending themselves in court against a proposed injunction from three residents who want to limit the volume and duration of the venue's outdoor summer concerts.\nIn a response\u00a0filed to the Yukon Supreme Court late last month, bakery co-owners Rhonda Powell and Christopher Robinson argue there's \"no serious question to be tried\" in the case. They also filed nine\u00a0affidavits from other local business owners, residents and arts groups\u00a0in support of their popular summer concert series, which sees musicians perform outdoors at the bakery on Friday and Saturday nights.\u00a0\nHaines Junction residents Valerie Drummond, Daniel Drummond and John Carney took the bakery to court earlier this year, alleging that some concerts in previous summers were too loud and went too late. The Drummonds live next to the bakery and Valerie Drummond runs a cabin-rental business nearby; they claim some concerts can be heard from inside their home and have also caused the cabin-rental business to suffer.\u00a0\nThe plaintiffs are asking for an interim injunction limiting the volume of live outdoor music at the bakery to 55 decibels as measured from the nearest neighbouring property \u2014 about the volume of a washing machine or a regular conversation \u2014 and a 9 p.m. cut-off.\u00a0\nPowell and Robinson are opposed to that, arguing in their reply that the Drummonds and Carney won't suffer \"irreparable harm\" and that the bakery and community would \"suffer a greater inconvenience\" should the injunction be granted.\nIn an affidavit, Powell acknowledges she once apologized for a concert being too loud in 2021, but that otherwise, performances are a reasonable volume and typically end around 9 to 9:30 p.m., when the village is \"still quite active.\" The affidavit also accuses Daniel Drummond of being \"aggressive\" during interactions about the concerts and alleges he's harassed the bakery by contacting sponsors and has demanded that no rock music performances be allowed.\u00a0 \nPowell's affidavit says excluding one type of music would be \"discriminatory\" and claims that the plaintiffs have only made demands instead of trying to reach a compromise or agreement.\u00a0\n'I fully support the Village Bakery and the weekend concerts'\nThe other affidavits describe the summer concerts as a boon to locals,\u00a0tourists and musicians.\nIn separate affidavits, Lynn Iler and Martin Laniel, the respective owners of the Raven's Rest Inn and Wanderer's Inn Backpackers Hostel, said\u00a0their guests have never complained about performances, and that the concerts are actually a draw for visitors.\u00a0\n\"I fully support the Village Bakery and the weekend concerts,\" Laniel's affidavit reads.\u00a0\n\"These have become an institution in the community over the years, and for me, they present pride in our town.\"\u00a0\nA sign posted inside the Village Bakery.\n \n(Leslie Amminson/CBC)\nSt. Elias Chamber of Commerce president Michael Pealow agreed,\u00a0writing in his affidavit\u00a0that the bakery concerts \"bring new wealth into Haines Junction from outside of the community\" and \"stimulate local spending while providing healthy entertainment for local residents.\"\u00a0\n\"They are joyful events where local residents gather and reconnect,\" his affidavit says, adding that media coverage of the lawsuit gave the\u00a0impression that Haines Junction was an \"unreasonable, unstable community\" and a bad place for business.\u00a0\nJazz Yukon executive director Duncan Sinclair, meanwhile,\u00a0described the injunction in his affidavit as \"beyond silly,\" and that granting it would have a negative impact on the arts community as a whole.\u00a0\nWhile a hearing of the\u00a0application for the injunction was initially set for June, court documents indicate that didn't happen and\u00a0the parties are now in the process of picking a new date.\u00a0",

However, in a press release Tuesday morning, police said the Whitehorse RCMP, with help from the RCMP Digital Forensic Services and the RCMP National Cybercrime Coordination Centre, \"opened an investigation into a series of computer hacking\" in September 2021.\u00a0\nAccording to the press release, police opened the investigation after data was discovered on devices and computers seized as part of a firearms investigation. The data\u00a0suggested more than 500 secure computer networks in the Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories had been targeted and attempts to access the networks had occurred, the press release says, and the investigation determined that more than 300 were compromised \"during the hacking.\"\u00a0\n\"While the investigation determined that a significant number of secure computer network passwords were compromised, there was no evidence that any business or personal data was compromised or stolen from the networks,\" the press release says.\nSteele's next court appearance is scheduled for August.",

All city roads were open as normal on Monday. He also said there was no indication that the storm increased the risk of more landslides along the escarpment.\n\"The biggest thing that we're focusing on right now is just clearing what debris was left over from both Saturday and Sunday,\" he said Monday afternoon.\n\"That includes everything from downed trees to gravel\u00a0from the intense rainfall to even, at some places, construction debris that flew onto the road.\"\u00a0\nStill, Jephson said it was a good reminder for city residents to be ready for emergencies.\u00a0\n\"These kinds of weather events, these sudden weather events, can happen throughout the year and it just again stresses the importance of the 72-hour preparedness kit, and making sure that you're prepared,\" he said.\nThe storms also hit other parts of Yukon. A spokesperson from the department of Highways and Public Works said there were reports of fallen trees in Tagish and Marsh Lake, and crews were still clearing debris from the roads in some areas.\n\"Since we are still assessing for potential damage, we cannot compare it to previous events,\" said department spokesperson Kalah\u00a0Klassen in a statement.\u00a0 ",

        "content": "A company is taking steps to drill for spodumene, a mineral containing lithium deposits, close to Hidden Lake.\u00a0\n\"I think it's an amazing opportunity for the community, for the First Nations, for the country,\" said Adam Ritchie, the managing director of Loyal Lithium.\u00a0\nLithium is used to make batteries, including electric vehicle batteries. Ritchie said the demand for the mineral is increasing, which has increased its price. He said the mine\u00a0would potentially create\u00a0200\u00a0jobs. He said previous\u00a0mining tests from\u00a0five years ago show that there is\u00a0spodumene in the area.\u00a0\nThe project is located near the end of Ingraham\u00a0Trail, three kilometres east of Hidden Lake. It comes as a partnership between Loyal Lithium and another lithium hard rock exploration company called Patriot Battery Metals.\u00a0\nRitchie said Hidden Lake is a prime location for drilling because they think there's enough spodumene there to support the mine.\u00a0\nThe company is currently holding public engagement talks with community leaders, First Nations and the territorial government in their community engagement process meant to last until the end of September. The company is hearing concerns and feedback from stakeholders, and will then apply for a land use permit which will allow the organization to start drilling.\u00a0\nThe pegmatite rock which has spodumene in it.  \n \n(Mah Noor Mubarik/ CBC News)\nOnce the permit is obtained the company can drill a rock called pegmatite, which contains spodumene, and will also drill underground too to see how much of the mineral is in the area.\u00a0\nSamples from the pegmatite will be extracted and laboratory tests will be done to analyze the rock and look for impurities.\u00a0\n\"You know it's like a blood sample. You go and test the blood to see what's in there\u2026that's what we're trying to do with this rock,\" said Ritchie.\u00a0 \nOnce the samples are taken, geological studies will be done before the eventual potential development of a mine.\u00a0\nEventually, the company is hoping to concentrate the spodumene, remove the rocks that don't have that lithium in it, and truck it out of the area. Then a partner company would work to extract the lithium from the mineral.\n\"I think there's a lot of employment opportunities for Indigenous people,\" said Eileen Marlowe, the manager for land and community with Loyal Lithium.\u00a0\nShe added that given that the diamond mines are\u00a0shutting down, this new mine will offer employment opportunities for people with the same set of skills.\u00a0\nEmployment is also something on Marc Whitford's mind. The president of the North Slave M\u00e9tis Alliance showed up to a community engagement meeting held on Monday at the Explorer Hotel.\u00a0\n\"It's economic opportunities for our people, that's the most important thing,\" he said.\u00a0\nWhitford said he's encouraged at this point, and says that the environment needs to be protected and the North has to develop at the same time.\u00a0\nWhile the project is just getting started, he said the project seems like it would be environmentally friendly.\u00a0\nRitchie said an environmental advantage for the company is that less power would be needed to separate the spodumene from pegmatite rock it's found in, because of the large size of the\u00a0 spodumene crystals.\u00a0\nThis lithium extraction project isn't the first around the area. Li-FT Power Ltd began drilling for lithium in the area in June.\u00a0",

        "content": "Two Yellowknife residents have taken on the repairs of a nearly-sunken houseboat.\u00a0\nBig Blue,\u00a0a two-storey vessel on Yellowknife Bay, had been seen partially underwater and vacated by its owner, former Yellowknifer Dan Gillis, who left town.\u00a0 \nAfter seeing photos of the foundering vessel\u00a0on Facebook, Nancy Gaudette and Nelson Johnson decided, \"well why don't we just try to save it?\"\n\"It's important right, it's part of history, it's part of the culture here and it would be a shame to see it go down,\" Johnson said.\u00a0\nThe couple contacted Gillis and arranged a deal where they fix the vessel and will then look to purchase it.\u00a0\nJohnson and Gaudette estimate they've so far spent about $19,000 on repairs, and done about 178 hours or work between them.  \n \n(Natalie Pressman/CBC)\n\"The agreement is, we'll get it up and floating and then once it's floating and stable then we'll look towards the purchase price and finally make an agreement on that,\" Johnson said.\u00a0\nHe declined to disclose the details of the offer since the deal isn't complete, \"but the price is very reasonable,\" he said.\nThe couple said their agreement with Gillis was in place by June 19. Since then they've repaired a broken tank to now hold air and stay afloat. Johnson said they plan to install four other tanks to support the home. Next, they'll have to make sure there's no mold from the parts that had been left underwater. He said they'll get the insulation out of the walls, let it dry and probably rebuild much of the vessel's interior.\nThen there's the deck.\nNelson Johnson at work on the deck of Big Blue.\n \n(Nancy Gaudette)\n\"Right now the deck is the biggest issue,\" Johnson said. He said it came off its attachments under the weight of the sideways-turned vessel.\n\"We've only got two corners of that deck that we're able to walk on.\"\nThe couple estimates they'll be living in Big Blue by September.\u00a0\nThey say they've so far spent about $19,000 on repairs, and 178 hours between the two of them.\u00a0\nThe pair has never lived on a houseboat and say they're thankful for the help of their soon-to-be neighbours on Yellowknife Bay. They said that when they're working on the boat they often have other houseboaters stop by to offer advice and contribute materials.\u00a0\n\"People are very nice here,\" Gaudette said.\n'Bit of a sideshow attraction'\nJake Olson is a houseboater who has lived on Yellowknife Bay for three and a half years. He says the houseboat community is pleased to welcome a new chapter for Big Blue.\u00a0\n\"I think we're all just happy to see new people,\" he said. \"We're excited that there's a new perspective out there on Big Blue that has the means and the capabilities to take on a project like that.\"\nInside the houseboat. Gaudette and Johnson expect they'll be living in Big Blue by September.\n \n(Nancy Gaudette)\nOlson said the sinking ship has been an unusual event that's brought a wave of attention to the houseboats.\u00a0\n\"There's just never been a circumstance where the owner or someone should be taking responsibility, completely walks away from the situation,\" he said, referring to Gillis leaving Yellowknife despite the vessel's deficiencies.\u00a0 \u00a0\nHe said there were sometimes 12 or 13 boaters a day circling Big Blue.\u00a0\n\"It turned into a little bit of a sideshow attraction,\" he said.\u00a0\nOlson said that the water below Big Blue is only about 10-feet deep, so the ship would never have sunk completely.\u00a0\nOne neighbour says the houseboat community is pleased to welcome a new chapter for Big Blue.\u00a0\n \n(Nancy Gaudette)\nEight other members of the houseboat community declined to comment on Big Blue or its surrounding circumstances.\nGillis did not respond to CBC's interview requests.\u00a0\nCBC asked Fisheries and Oceans Canada \u2014 the government department that oversees the Canadian Coast Guard \u2014 about the implications of neglecting the vessel and what might have happened if no prospective owners came along to fix Big Blue.\u00a0\nThe department did not respond before\u00a0deadline.\u00a0\nJohnson said that he has been in touch with the Coast Guard to inform the agency that the vessel isn't abandoned. The couple admits they've got their work cut out for them to get Big Blue back in shape but say they're looking forward to learning from their more-experienced neighbours.\u00a0 \n\"Once everything is done,\" Gaudette said, \"come over and have a visit and just chat with us. That's nice. We like people.\"",

During summer field work, they studied permafrost and changes in Arctic tundra in Canada, Alaska and Siberia.\nWhen working on the North Slope, Daanen brought his homemade gin flavored with spruce tips, which Epstein said was \"delicious.\" On a tiny island in Siberia, Daanen walked in with a chunk of gouda cheese the size of a curling stone, which they ate from at every meal for a week.\nDaanen and his wife, Ina Timling, also competed in the World Ice Art Championships in Fairbanks.

He paid his way through college by joining the North Dakota National Guard and had to have his parents sign off because he was just a few months shy of his 18th birthday when he joined.\n\"He's determined, a young man who chased his dream and accomplished a lot in his life,\" his mother Karla said.\nThis photo taken on Nov. 24, 2022, shows Justin Germann in Hatcher Pass, near Wasilla, Alaska. Germann was among those who died in last week's helicopter crash.\n \n(Alyssa Marie Enriquez/AP)\nHe completed an internship in Alaska and immediately made plans to return.\n\"I don't think he was ever coming back to southwest North Dakota. That was his dream to be there and kayak and just hike and ride a bike in the snow, which is beyond crazy to me,\" she said with a chuckle.\nThe family had planned to visit Germann in Alaska in September but instead will travel this week to Fairbanks, where they are planning an informal memorial. His mother has been comforted by her son's Alaska friends, who reached out to his family after his death.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\"He had a lot of amazing friends up there, and we can't wait to meet them,\" she said.\nThis photo taken on May 16, 2021, near Custer, S.D., shows Brandon Orcutt, left, and Justin Germann. \n \n(Summer Orcutt/AP)\nMoore was a 2019 graduate from Indiana with a degree in geological and earth sciences.

        "summary": "Some residents in Tagish, Yukon were left in the dark on Tuesday after a freak storm over the weekend downed trees and power lines in the area.",
        "content": "Some residents in Tagish, Yukon\u00a0were still without power on Tuesday after wild weather\u00a0knocked down trees and power lines throughout the area over the weekend.\nA couple of heavy thunderstorms tore through parts of southern Yukon on Saturday and Sunday, including Tagish, Marsh Lake\u00a0and Whitehorse.\nIn Whitehorse, the strong winds and heavy downpours \ntemporarily wreaked havoc\n, with brief power outages, flooded streets, and some fallen trees. But within hours, things were mostly back to normal.\nSome people in Tagish felt they got hit much worse \u2014 pointing to dozens of\u00a0large toppled trees still littered all around the community. They were also still waiting on Tuesday afternoon for the power to come back on.\n\"The trees were bending over the house. Then it changed to another direction and hail started coming down pretty heavily and water, lightning,\" said Lidys Garcia, recalling Sunday's storm.\n\"It's kind of like a mini tornado that you see on, you know, down in the prairies or somewhere.\"\n'The trees were bending over the house,' said Tagish resident Lidys Garcia.\n \n(Ethan Lang/CBC)\nGarcia stayed inside with her family as the tempest\u00a0swept in.\n\"It was kind of like a flash storm. It lasted maybe 30 to 40 minutes, one hour the most, but it was quite heavy,\" she said.\nOnce the storm passed, Garcia went outside to assess the damage. Her house was mostly fine, but fallen trees had them feeling trapped on their street.\u00a0 \n\"We couldn't go anywhere. We had trees on this side and on the other side. So there was no going anywhere for anybody in the area, in the street.\"\u00a0\nFallen trees piled up in Tagish.\n \n(Ethan Lang/CBC)\nBrian Thompson, another Tagish resident, recalled watching the storm build off in the distance across the lake.\n\"It got black and black and black and then the wind started coming from the other side, coming at us,\" he said.\n\"I see the trees start swirling. They're swirling. Was it just ... from the action of the wind or were they in a tornado? I don't know\"\nGrowing permafrost slump threatens part of Alaska Highway, road to be moved\nHe watched three big trees topple outside his house.\n\"This tree, this tree and that tree. I was sitting right there and I saw them all drop within probably a 20-second interval,\" he\u00a0said.\nThompson began to worry about his vehicle, parked where a falling tree could easily flatten it.\n\"Deb said I shouldn't run outside right now,\u00a0but\u00a0I didn't want my car to get destroyed.\"\u00a0\nCrews with ATCO Electric Yukon were still working to restore power in Tagish on Tuesday.\n \n(Ethan Lang/CBC)\nThat's when the winds seemed to die down as quickly as they had whipped up. Assessing the damage afterward, Thompson also counted himself lucky \u2014 there were a few toppled trees on his property hung up in branches and waiting to fall, but it seemed he\u00a0hadn't been hit as hard as some of his neighbours.\nIn a social media post on Tuesday, ATCO Electric Yukon said Tagish residents in the California Beach area would have power later that afternoon and residents in the Taku area would have power restored by 10 p.m. Customers on Penny Cook Lane would continue to be without power on Tuesday night.\nNobody from ATCO\u00a0Electric Yukon responded to calls from\u00a0CBC News on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, another potentially severe storm was expected to hit the region on Tuesday evening. A severe thunderstorm watch issued by Environment Canada for Whitehorse, Carcross, and Haines Junction cites the potential for things such as \"large hail, damaging winds, torrential rainfall.\"\u00a0",

        "summary": "For more than two decades, sockeye runs on Yukon's Alsek River have been historically low, but that began to change last year, and the upward trend could continue this August, according to fisheries officials.",
        "content": "After decades of low numbers, this summer's sockeye salmon run on Yukon's Alsek River is expected to be above average for the second year in a row. What's behind the rebound is still a mystery.\nLast year, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) expected 11,000 sockeye salmon to return to the Alsek to spawn, but the actual number was more than double\u00a0that prediction. It was the highest escapement seen in the area in more than two decades.\nDFO expects this year's runs could see nearly as many sockeye in the river, which flows from the Yukon through northern B.C. to Alaska.\n\"We're not anticipating we'll meet last year's numbers,\" said Tom Buzzell, a transboundary river manager for DFO.\u00a0\n\"Our early-run sockeye numbers are very low, but coming in for the late run sockeye, which will run later into August and into September, we have a just slightly above-average forecast of 30,000 fish coming in.\"\nBuzzell says it's unclear why numbers have bounced back recently.\n\"It could have been a larger ocean survival,\" he said. \"But no real strong answers.\"\nSockeye runs on the Alsek began dropping off in the 1990s, remaining consistently low until last year.\u00a0\nAnd British Columbia sockeye runs are currently dipping due to warmer-than-usual waters there. The province has restricted fishing of sockeye on the Fraser River to help conservation efforts this year.\nNumbers there are still much larger than in the Yukon. About 4.8 million sockeye swim the Fraser each year on average. Only a third of those\u00a0are predicted to make it up the river this year, still far more than the 30,000 expected in the Alsek.\nAfter decades of dwindling runs, sockeye salmon return to Yukon fishing village in droves\nYukon River chinook, chum salmon runs expected to be small again this year\nSalmon are getting cooked by climate change. Here's how they could be saved\nSubsistence fishing of sockeye is currently open on the Alsek\u00a0River though. The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations\u00a0have fished sockeye on the Alsek and its tributaries for thousands of years.\nAnd depending on actual numbers this year, recreational fishing in the area could also open by mid-August, Buzzel said.\nThat has Eric Schroff excited. He's executive director of the Yukon Fish and Game Association.\n\"I've fished over there a couple of times over the past decade. And it's great just to look forward to a potential opening this year,\" he said in an interview. \"For many, many people in Yukon, it's the only chance they have to fish for salmon in the Yukon.\"\nSchroff says low numbers in recent decades have made recreational sockeye fishing uncertain from year to year. He says not many people fish recreationally for sockeye when it's open, but it's a special experience for those who do.\n\"People are very careful about how many fish they catch,\u00a0and treasure the experience and hope they can do it again next year.\"\u00a0",

        "content": "When it comes to determination and drive, Charlotte Siksik has it in spades.\nThe 17-year-old forward from Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, and her family are still celebrating the recent news that she's been signed to play women's hockey this fall for the NCAA Division III Arcadia Knights in Philadelphia, Pa.\n\"I was really excited. It took a lot of work to get there, to a school that had basically everything I ever wanted, and it felt amazing,\" she said.\nCharlotte was with a group of her friends when she found out she would be playing for the Knights. The first thing she did is message her mom, Hannah Siksik.\n\"We had a very excited phone call about that, and my friends are very happy for me,\" she said.\nSiksik has travelled across Canada to develop her hockey skills. She played the past three seasons with the female U18 Prep team at the RINK Hockey Academy in Winnipeg, where she tallied six goals and nine assists in 48 games.\nCharlotte Siksik, centre right in the #66 jersey, has played the past three seasons with the female U18 Prep team at RINK Hockey Academy in Winnipeg.\n \n(Submitted by Hannah Siksik)\nOnce in Philadelphia, she'll be hitting the ice five days a\u00a0 week, with games every weekend on top of her studies. While there, she'll be majoring in biology with the hope of one day becoming a wildlife veterinarian.\nGrowing up in a hockey town\nFew places in Nunavut could have set a better foundation for her hockey success than Rankin Inlet, said Hannah\nKnown as a hockey town, and having produced the likes of former NHL player Jordin Tootoo, Rankin Inlet had a lot of support available for young athletes. Charlotte, who started playing hockey when she was in Grade 2, was soon asked to play with the female hockey team and got to travel with them.\n\"Our life kind of revolved around the arena for a while there, while she was home,\" Hannah said. Both she and Charlotte gave a shout-out to David Clark, Charlotte's coach in Rankin Inlet.\n\"She had great coaches that truly believed in not just what happens on the ice ... It was about the whole holistic approach of it, which was great,\" Hannah said.\nCharlotte Siksik from Rankin Inlet recently signed on to play hockey for the Arcadia Knights in Pennsylvania.\n \n(Submitted by Hannah Siksik)\nEarly on, Charlotte displayed an immense drive and focus to play hockey and to excel academically, Hannah said. At 13, Charlotte left home to follow her hockey dream, travelling to Ontario and then being recruited to the RINK Hockey Academy.\n\"She's worked so hard for this,\" Hannah said. \"To get that phone call and hear that she's been selected by this university that she really, really wanted to go to was just an amazing moment \u2014 just for it all to kind of count.\"\nWhile this is the most recent triumph for Charlotte, Hannah says her daughter has had a string of hockey successes. Last year, she was named Nunavut's 2022\u00a0Female Athlete of the Year by the Recreation and Parks Association of Nunavut.\nLast fall, Siksik was named Nunavut's 2022 Female Athlete of the Year by the Recreation and Parks Association of Nunavut.\n \n(Submitted by Hannah Siksik)\nBut for Hannah, it's the everyday moments of watching Charlotte play that stand out in her memory.\nThere was the time Charlotte's team \u2014 of which she was the only female member \u2014 won gold at the tournament. And this past season, she captained her team at the hockey academy.\n\"When she puts on her Team Nunavut uniform and skates out on the ice, that's a huge moment of pride for me, when I see her celebrating on the ice,\" Hannah said. \"She rose to every challenge. And those moments just make me incredibly proud.\"\n'I've always dreamed of this': Nunavut hockey player reflects on playing for U.S. team\nAs for Charlotte, being signed to play for a university team is proof that all the years of sacrifice were worth it. The huge challenge of leaving home at a young age has prepared her for her academic future in the U.S., and she said she hopes to play professional women's hockey either in Europe or in Canada once she's done school.\n\"Don't give up on your dreams. You can do anything you want, as long as you push yourself and work hard \u2014 and stay focused, because there is no limit to what you can do,\" she said.",

Department of Infrastructure confirmed the highway is closed between kilometres 246 and 334 \u2014 the entire stretch between the two communities.\n\"Residents should not travel in this area,\" the department stated in an email.\nThe 63,441-hectare fire has also moved closer to\u00a0Behchok\u01eb. It was within 12 kilometres of the community on Tuesday evening.\nOfficials said the community was considered under threat from the fire\u00a0while Yellowknife, still 45 kilometres away from the blaze on Tuesday evening, was not under threat.\nTuesday evening's update also said there were rumours of spot fire in\u00a0Behchok\u01eb\u00a0but that there was \"no evidence to support that at this time.\"\nSimilar strong winds from the east were expected again on Wednesday, officials said. That could continue to push the fire westward toward\u00a0Behchok\u01eb\u00a0and challenge firefighters.\nOn Monday,\u00a0Behchok\u01eb's 2,000\u00a0residents were ordered to leave their homes and travel Highway 3 to Yellowknife. Less than a day later, the highway had been closed.\nMike Westwick, fire information officer with the territorial government, said earlier Tuesday that structure protection is still a priority for crews.\u00a0\n\"It is a very serious situation, but we have prepared for this and taken steps to protect the things that folks value out there,\" he said.\u00a0\nHe said\u00a0there has not yet been any reported damage or losses to homes or cabins as as result of the fire.\u00a0\nWestwick said crews were doing planned burns near Stagg River to try to head off the western end of that wildfire, but those burns jumped the control lines crews had set in the area.\nHe added that crews are working on dozer lines near Russell Lake, just north of Behchok\u01eb\u0300,\u00a0where they will dig out any fuel for the fire.\u00a0He added that an additional 40 firefighters \u2014 20 from Alaska and 20 from New Brunswick \u2014 are coming to support operations.\nVehicles line up before a roadblock out of Yellowknife. The highway was shut down Tuesday afternoon due to a wildfire.\n \n(Jay Legere/CBC)\nBefore the highway closed,\u00a0Behchok\u01eb\u00a0Chief Clifford Daniels told CBC\u00a0he was trying to stay optimistic but was worried about what would happen.\nDaniels was at the pilgrimage in Lac Ste. Anne, Alta., when the evacuation order came down, but flew back to the N.W.T. and was driving Highway 3 around noon Tuesday when he took CBC's call.\u00a0Lac Ste. Anne had its own extreme weather Tuesday, which forced the cancellation of the annual pilgrimage.\nSome Behchok\u01eb residents had been with him in Lac Ste. Anne and were distraught to hear the news, he added. He suggested they take their time returning, so there isn't an influx of nearly 200 more people.\nHe said most people have left\u00a0Behchok\u01eb\u00a0now, though a few have chosen to stay.\n\"It's good that lots of people are going to be safe, away from harm. Lots of material things are in question ... those things can be replaced if it does get worse,\" he said.\nHe added that he hopes to have a better idea by Thursday on whether the fire is something they can fight.\n\"[A] change in the weather, too, would help \u2014 especially rain. And, you know, little prayers here and there wouldn't hurt,\" he said. \"I think it's really needed \u2014 we need some type of something to help us really change the situation we're in.\"\nFire takes out power\nShortly after announcing the highway closure, power went down in Yellowknife and Behchok\u01eb\u0300. Power was out in Yellowknife for about an hour, and took longer to restore in most of\u00a0Behchok\u01eb\u0300.\n\"Initial indications are that the fires near Behchok\u01eb have interrupted electricity transmission from Snare. Further investigation is necessary to confirm,\" NTPC stated.\n\"Updates will be provided as information becomes available.\"\nHighway 3 is closed right up to Yellowknife, where a road block is stopping vehicles from getting through.",

        "content": "The Association of Yukon Communities (AYC) says the territory has to think creatively to solve an ongoing shortage of health care workers.\n\"This is an issue we continue to hear from all of our members throughout rural Yukon,\" said Ted Laking, a Whitehorse city councillor and president of the AYC.\n\"What we continue to hear from our members is that this is a big deal.\"\nEarlier this month, the Yukon government's Department of Health and Social Services notified residents living in the communities of Mayo, Pelly Crossing\u00a0and Destruction Bay that services at their local health centres would be \ntemporarily reduced\n.\nThat prompted\u00a0Dawna Hope, chief of the Na-Cho Ny\u00e4k Dun First Nation in Mayo, to write a letter to Health Minister Tracy-Anne\u00a0McPhee\u00a0\ndecrying the lapse in medical services\n in her community, and saying it puts local residents at risk.\nLaking followed with his own letter on behalf of the AYC to McPhee last week, echoing some of Hope's concerns.\u00a0\nLaking said the AYC also raised similar concerns last year, but those seemed to fall on deaf ears.\n\"We did feel that last summer they sort of ignored the issue,\" Laking told CBC News.\nLaking suggests the need for \"creative\" solutions, such as allowing licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to provide care in some communities where registered nurses (RNs) are typically hired.\n\"I understand that there are shortages, it is tough to recruit, but if that's the case then we should be looking, how do we change our retention bonuses?\u00a0How to we change our compensation for nurses? How to we make this a very attractive jurisdiction to bring people into the communities?\"\nA Yukon government spokesperson declined an interview with CBC News until the minister\u00a0is able to provide a direct response to the AYC, sometime in the coming days.\nPandemic worsened stress on northern health care workers: Yukon University report\nIn a written response to Chief Hope last week, McPhee said service reductions at health centres are one way to prevent burnout among nurses in rural communities, and that emergency services in Mayo were also expanded to help soften the impact of the reductions.\n\"The Yukon continues to be impacted by the global, national and territorial health human resource challenges and we are taking action to recruit and retain health professionals,\" McPhee's statement reads.\n\"I am looking forward to learning more in the near future about tactics from the Yukon Health Human Resources Steering Committee, which is developing a strategy to address the health human resources challenges in the Yukon.\"\u00a0",

        "content": "An evacuation alert has been issued for the Dublin Gulch area, northwest of Keno City, Yukon, due to the risk associated with an out-of-control wildfire nearby.\nThe alert applies to most of the South McQuesten Road. The area is roughly 20 kilometres in radius and includes\u00a0Victoria Gold's Eagle mine. It does not include any part of the Silver Trail or McQuesten Lake, or the communities of Keno City or Mayo.\u00a0\nAn alert is meant to provide people with time to prepare in case an evacuation order is issued later. People who receive an evacuation order should be ready to leave their properties within two hours of being notified, officials say.\nThe East McQuesten River fire is burning in a wilderness zone and was about 2,600 hectares in size as of Monday morning. The fire was first reported on Thursday.\n\"Over the weekend\u00a0it did grow south, closer to the South McQuesten Road\u00a0and that's what triggered this evacuation alert,\" said Haley Ritchie, with Yukon Wildland Fire Management.\u00a0 \n\"So we're not asking people to leave, but this is the early heads-up that there's a fire of concern in the area and people should monitor updates just in case it does change to an order.\"\nRitchie said along with the Eagle mine, there are several smaller placer mining operations active in the area.\nA map shows the Dublin Gulch area in Yukon that's subject to an evacuation alert. The East McQuesten River fire was about 2,600 hectares in size on Monday morning.\n \n(Yukon Government)\nEmergency officials say the fire is receiving a monitored response, meaning they are keeping an eye on it in case it threatens people or infrastructure, but they are not actively fighting it.\u00a0 \nAn initial attack crew, a wildfire officer and a helicopter are now dedicated to the fire, Ritchie said.\n\"They're going to be working on site protection, setting up things like sprinklers on some of the smaller camps. And we're going to be in the air doing as much assessment as we can, to see if there are opportunities for suppression,\" she said.\n\"It's a bit of a chess game. We do need to keep some of our resources ready to respond if we have more lightning-caused fires in different areas in the territory.\"\nAn evacuation alert also remains in place for Kilometres 10 to 35 of the Silver Trail, due to a fire burning northeast of Stewart Crossing.

Most of those are in the wilderness zone.\nTwo small fires also started on Sunday in the Rabbit Creek area, about 20 kilometres northeast of Dawson City.\nBoth fires received a full response, and one was declared under control by Sunday evening. The other was not expected to grow overnight, and firefighters were expected to be working on it again on Monday.",

        "summary": "A review committee has concluded\u00a0there was nothing stopping the Correctional Service of Canada from giving victims' families advance warning of the prison transfer of serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo.",
        "content": "A review committee has concluded\u00a0there was nothing stopping the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) from giving victims' families advance warning of serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo's prison transfer.\nThe committee also concluded that\u00a0decisions Corrections Canada made regarding Bernardo's\u00a0security classification and transfer from a maximum to medium-security prison\u00a0\"were completed in compliance with legal and policy frameworks.\"\nCorrectional Service of Canada commissioner Anne Kelly presented the results of the review on Thursday. She said the committee concluded that while the decision to transfer Bernardo was \"sound\"\u00a0and the corrections agency\u00a0\"went above policy in this case to notify victims, additional steps could have been taken to provide more information.\"\n\"We contacted all of the registered victims prior to this announcement, and I spoke directly to those wishing to be walked through the findings,\" said Kelly.\u00a0\n\"What they have gone through\u00a0is unimaginable. Public safety, and their safety, continues to be top of mind for us in any decisions we make. Hearing about this case so intensely over the past weeks has brought up strong emotions, and rightly so. I regret any pain and concern this transfer has caused.\"\nBernardo is a dangerous offender serving a life sentence with no chance\u00a0of parole for 25 years\u00a0for kidnapping, torturing and killing Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s near St.\u00a0Catharines, Ont.\u00a0He was also found guilty of\u00a0the manslaughter and sexual assault of his 15-year-old sister-in-law Tammy Homolka.\nCorrections commissioner never mentioned Bernardo transfer over months of conversations: Mendicino\nMurder victims' families outraged over Ontario killer's move to medium-security prison\nThe political fallout from Paul Bernardo's prison transfer\nBernardo was quietly transferred\u00a0on May 29 from a high-security prison in Ontario to a medium-security prison in Quebec. Experts say the move means Bernardo might not send as much time in his cell and could associate with other inmates and attend group therapy sessions. They've also said the transfer does not elevate his escape\u00a0risk.\u00a0\nIn response to\u00a0public outrage,\u00a0Kelly's department in June tasked a three-person review committee\u00a0with determining if Bernardo's transfer was appropriate, if victims were given enough consideration\u00a0and if all policies and rules were followed.\nVictims' families were first notified of Bernardo was being moved the morning of his transfer. Their lawyer has said the lack of advance notice caused his clients\u00a0emotional distress.\n\"The Review Committee concluded that while notification adhered to what was required by policy \u2026 there was likely room within the realm of what is permitted by policy to have ensured greater care, sensitivity and compassion in delivering news of the transfer to victims,\" the report said.\nThe review committee's report recommended\u00a0that CSC share the report's\u00a0findings with registered victims\u00a0and that Kelly launch a working committee to improve its practices on\u00a0engaging victims and sending out notifications within her department about high-profile offenders.\nWATCH | Bernardo is still designated as a dangerous offender:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCorrections Canada says rules were followed in Bernardo prison transfer\n5 days ago\nDuration \n3:05\nThe head of the Correctional Service of Canada, which runs the prison system, says the service followed the rules around the prison transfer of Paul Bernardo. The commissioner of the agency said Bernardo met the criteria for the transfer. However, a review committee said more could have been done to notify his victims' families.\nKelly said she fully accepts the recommendations.\nShe said\u00a0the correctional system in Canada is based on the rehabilitation of offenders \u2014 even if some remain in prison for the rest of their lives \u2014\u00a0and it has\u00a0to balance \"public safety risks, secure and humane offender treatment, and victims' rights.\"\n\"I want to be clear that, at any point, an inmate can be returned to a higher security level, if deemed necessary, to ensure the safety of the public or our institutions,\" Kelly said.\nThroughout her press conference, Kelly insisted that\u00a0Bernardo's transfer\u00a0to a medium security prison would not lead to his release.\nWhen asked\u00a0if\u00a0CSC should have\u00a0shown the victims' families more consideration, Kelly said that the department has \"compassion for the victims.\"\n\"The fact that he is at a medium security institution does not negate the fact that he is a psychopath and that he committed horrific and unspeakable crimes,\"\u00a0Kelly said.\nKelly's report noted that Bernardo scored as a medium risk on 13 assessments dating back to 1999, but that classification was overturned.\nIn his most recent assessment, which was used to approve his transfer, Bernardo scored as a moderate\u00a0escape risk, moderate on institutional adjustment\u00a0and a high risk to public safety, Kelly said.\n\"Despite being a medium security inmate, he is still assessed as a high risk to the safety of the public. Even after close to 30 years of incarceration he also continues to hold a dangerous offender designation, which was imposed by the court,\" she said.\nKelly said\u00a0the medium security institution will keep him as secure as a maximum security prison.\n\"He's in a cell. It has the same perimeter controls, high fences, armed patrols,\" she said.\nAnne Kelly, commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada, addresses a press conference presenting the results of a review related to the security reclassification and transfer of inmate Paul Bernardo.\n \n(Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press)\nTim Danson, the lawyer for the victims' families, said he is still reviewing the report but denounced the decision to transfer Bernardo.\n\"Sentencing is the means by which society communicates its moral values. That equally applies to prison placement,\" he said in a media statement.\n\"Sadistic sexual psychopaths who have not exhibited any remorse, empathy or insight into their unspeakable crimes, after being incarcerated for over 28 years ... should never be transferred to a medium security prison.\"\nDanson said the government should look at making\u00a0legislative changes that would prevent the transfers of dangerous offenders to medium security institutions.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier Thursday he was looking\u00a0forward to reading the\u00a0review's conclusions.\nWATCH |\nTrudeau says there are 'lessons' to learn from Bernardo transfer debacle:\u00a0\nTrudeau says there are 'lessons' to learn from Bernardo transfer debacle\n5 days ago\nDuration \n1:14\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government will be following up on lessons learned from the controversial Paul Bernardo prison transfer.\n\"Our thoughts have to turn first to the French and Mahaffy families, who continue to live the loss of their daughters so many years ago\u00a0that still hurts deeply today,\" he said. \"I think the entire country is still reeling from the anguish of these terrible, terrible acts. That's the lens with which we have to go through all these processes.\"\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre blamed Trudeau for the decision to keep Bernardo at a medium security prison. He said the government should adopt a law that would keep mass murderers in maximum security prisons.\n\"[Bernardo] should never be out of a max security penitentiary. To allow it is an injustice to the victims and their families,\" he told reporters after the review was released.\nVictims' families said they were shocked\u00a0that Kelly's department only notified them of Bernardo's transfer the morning of May 29 \u2014 the day he was transferred.\nDanson\u00a0has\u00a0said the families\u00a0should have been warned\u00a0earlier\u00a0and\u00a0should have been\u00a0part of the discussion before the decision was made.\nPublic Safety Minister Marco Mendicino has\u00a0come under fire over his handling of the file, which led the Conservatives to call for his resignation.\nIn June, Mendicino\u00a0called Bernardo's\u00a0transfer\u00a0\"shocking and incomprehensible.\"\u00a0 CBC News later revealed that Mendicino's office was first notified of the \ntransfer three months in advance, and again days before it happened.\n\u00a0\nWATCH |\u00a0\nMendicino sidesteps question about Bernardo transfer:\n\u00a0\nMarco Mendocino sidesteps questions about Bernardo transfer\n1 month ago\nDuration \n2:31\nPublic Safety Minister Marco Mendocino avoided questions from reporters on why he was not told about the prison transfer of serial killer Paul Bernardo and whether anyone would be held accountable. He also rejected continued calls to resign from opposition MPs.\nMendicino has maintained his office failed to tell him of Bernardo's transfer before it\u00a0was completed on May 29. The minister said last month he's taken \"corrective actions internally\" and has told his staff that he should have been briefed earlier.\nWhen asked if he still has confidence in Mendicino and if he handled the file appropriately, Trudeau first sidestepped the question before saying\u00a0he has confidence in his cabinet.\u00a0\n\"I have an amazing\u00a0team in Ottawa and an amazing group of MPs right across the country who are committed to serving their country every single day, and anyone in my cabinet by definition\u00a0has my confidence,\" said Trudeau.\u00a0\nOn Thursday, Poilievre\u00a0again called for Mendicino's resignation.\nWATCH |\u00a0\nPoilieve reacts to report on Bernadro transfer:\u00a0\nPoilievre says Trudeau's law helped facilitate Bernardo prison transfer\n5 days ago\nDuration \n1:14\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre says that if he's elected prime minister, he'll ensure that 'all mass murderers stay in maximum security prison for the rest of their lives.'\nMendicino last month asked for a ministerial order making it mandatory to notify the minister of public safety\u00a0and victims' families before a\u00a0high-profile prison\u00a0transfer.\u00a0The minister\u00a0issued a formal directive Thursday that also requires CSC\u00a0to notify victims at the start of a transfer assessment process.\n\"More must be done to ensure victims are at the forefront fo these decisions\u00a0\u2014 and I am determined to see that done,\" Mendicino said in a media statement following the report's release.\nWhile Kelly said her office followed long-standing procedures, she\u00a0acknowledged Mendicino's directive.\n\"My team ensured that the minister's office was briefed and I had assurances that they had been briefed. I cannot speak to what was put in front of the minister but moving forward \u2026 I will formally and directly advise the minister,\" she said.\nFor more than a decade, the Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime has been calling on the Correctional Service of Canada to notify victims of prison transfers in advance and allow them to share their concerns before the decision is made.",

She often takes her bereavement support groups into nature, where she finds people can feel more comfortable opening up about how they're feeling.\u00a0\nAs of this week, she has a new spot to bring her young charges to \u2014\u00a0a spacious grove in the woods at Ball's Falls Conservation Area, where you can find\u00a0a special phone\u00a0to call deceased loved ones,\u00a0tucked up beside the base of the Niagara Escarpment and some massive boulders.\nKnown as a \"wind phone,\" the old-school handset is mounted on a stand amid the trees, not far from the Twenty Mile Creek. It's a place for grieving people to feel connection with their deceased loved ones, part of a worldwide movement that began in Japan in 2010.\nThis unconnected phone helps people reach out to lost loved ones\nKrasnor, a developmental psychologist before she retired, believes the phone will be a vector for preteen children in her current group to feel connected with\u00a0the people they lost.\nLinda-Rose Krasnor volunteers with grieving kids, through Hospice Niagara, and is looking forward to bringing her group members to see the new wind phone.\n \n(Saira Peesker/CBC)\n\"I think there's a sense of needing to say things and wanting to communicate, and still feeling a connection\u00a0and wanting a relationship, that kids are going to appreciate,\" she said Wednesday, as the wind phone was revealed at an event at the Lincoln, Ont., conservation area. It's\u00a0a shared project of Hospice Niagara and the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority.\u00a0 \nKrasnor acknowledged, however, that some children\u00a0may have never seen a phone of this variety, with a handset and a dial: \"I may have to do a demonstration.\"\n'Connected to nowhere'\nSasaki Itaru created \nthe first \"phone of the wind\"\n in northeastern Japan\u00a0while he was grieving his cousin's death from cancer.\n\"The 'Phone of the Wind'\u00a0is connected to nowhere, however, talking to lost loved ones via the phone makes people feeling to be connected with their lost loved ones,\" states the website for the original wind phone.\n\"The feeling of being connected with loved ones is an imagination created by the people's broken heart, however, this imagination provides those people a hope to live.\"\nA wind phone was erected in New Maryland, N.B., earlier this year.\n \n(Tim Scammell)\nIt says the phone helps people communicate things they wish they had said while the person was alive.\u00a0\nThere are now more than \n100 wind phones around the world\n, with particular concentrations of them in Europe and North America. The Ball's Falls installation marks the first one in Niagara, with the nearest others in Ontario\u00a0in Mississauga, Port Franks and Lindsay. There are also several wind phones in New York state.\nPeople 'didn't have a chance to say goodbye' in\u00a0pandemic\nMelissa Penner, Hospice Niagara's bereavement specialist, said\u00a0she'll use the region's new wind phone to speak with her mom\u00a0and her mother-in-law, who both died within a short time of each other. She envisions some people treating the wind phone like a gravesite, particularly those for whom travelling to their loved ones' resting places is onerous or impossible.\nShe added\u00a0many people who lost someone during the pandemic didn't get a chance for closure, and this could help.\nJohn Riley set up a wind phone in Digby, N.S.\n \n(Robert Short/CBC)\n\"A lot of people during the pandemic didn't have a chance to say goodbye or have a funeral, or their loved one died suddenly, so they may not have the opportunity to say goodbye,\" Penner said Wednesday, noting it could also be a place to share new developments with people who have died. \"Some people maybe have graduated, or got married or whatever \u2014\u00a0the joyful moments of, 'Hey, I wish you would have been here. You wouldn't believe what whoever did.'\"\nNew Maryland 'wind phone' helps people grieve lost loved ones\nSilent phone in Ontario forest invites grieving trail walkers to talk to lost loved ones\nShe said\u00a0the private nature of the wind phone, perched at a beautiful spot in the woods, may appeal to people who are grieving but not comfortable seeking help.\n\"I hear often, 'Oh I'm fine,' but they're not fine \u2014\u00a0they're just not ready for a support group,\" she said. \"If people feel like that, this phone is a spot where maybe they can share the thoughts and feelings that are on their hearts, if they need a space to release that.\"\u00a0",

        "summary": "While the Not In My Backyard phenomenon existed long before the current housing shortage in Canada became pronounced, experts say counteracting it is more important now than ever before",
        "content": "A housing crisis is well underway in Canada, and experts say the problem is only made worse\u00a0by residents who oppose new housing developments.\nWhile the sentiment, known commonly as\u00a0Not In My Backyard (NIMBY),\u00a0existed long before the housing shortage became pronounced, experts say counteracting it is more important now than ever before.\nWhy does Nimbyism exist?\nResidents passionate about their communities want to have a say in\u00a0what gets built and where, said Geoff Kettel, the president of the Federation of Urban Neighbourhoods, an Ontariowide coalition of resident associations.\nConcerns range from a condo development casting shadows on\u00a0existing\u00a0properties\u00a0to\u00a0whether or not local hospitals, schools and other services can keep up with growth in the local population, he said. But voicing them,\u00a0often through public consultations,\u00a0comes with the risk of\u00a0being labelled a\u00a0NIMBY, which Kettel\u00a0called \"pejorative.\"\n\"We're regular citizens,\" said Kettel. \"Everybody has the right to express themselves and\u00a0to be part of the community.\"\nWATCH |\u00a0Who is getting richer and who is being shut out, with no safe place to call home? \nBehind Closed Doors: Canada\u2019s Rental Crisis\n5 months ago\nDuration \n22:30\nWe investigate the impact the current housing crisis is having on low-income Canadians, and reveal who is being shut out with no safe place to call home.\nResident associations don't want to stop development altogether, Kettel\u00a0said, adding many want to help \"moderate\" growth and encourage new projects\u00a0to be in line with local neighbourhood character.\nNIMBY sentiment\u00a0is particularly directed toward \naffordable housing projects\n proposed in existing neighbourhoods, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).\nLeslie Evans, executive director of the Federation of Calgary Communities, an umbrella organization of more than 100 community associations,\u00a0says affordable housing developments often stir fears of increased\u00a0crime rates and lower\u00a0property values among locals, which aren't proven to be true.\nAnd while there will always be people who are \"stuck\" with\u00a0NIMBY views, they're a minority, she said, adding that most\u00a0residents often become more open to development after learning how it benefits the community.\nMinimum wage couldn't land you a 1-bedroom unit years ago. Now, it's even worse. Here's why\n'Not in my backyard': How discrimination is a barrier for those experiencing homelessness\n\"Labelling them NIMBY is a good way to dismiss people that may or may not have legitimate concern,\" said Evans.\n\"Lots of that is they don't necessarily understand what it is\u00a0and how to build great communities. To build great communities, we need\u00a0diversity of\u00a0people and housing.\"\nHow prevalent is the problem?\nJim Dunn, director of independent academic network the Canadian Housing Evidence Collaborative,\u00a0says\u00a0it's hard to quantify the number of potential housing units that could have been built but weren't because of NIMBY sentiment.\nBut people can\u00a0look at\u00a0municipal\u00a0land use maps for a sense of how neighbourhoods have been allowed to develop over time, Dunn said, pointing to Toronto's\u00a0\"yellowbelt.\"\nHuge swaths of the city's residential areas, shown in yellow, were historically zoned strictly for single-detached or semi-detached homes. That changed this year after \ncity council voted to allow\n the development of two, three and four-unit multiplexes throughout.\n\"A huge part of Nimbyism was actually enshrined in zoning legislation,\" said Dunn, adding that local politicians are put in a \"bind\" having to choose between supporting outraged constituents and\u00a0increasing housing supply.\nAreas shaded in yellow on the City of Toronto's land use map signify land slated for residential use. These areas were historically designated for single-family, detached home development until recent months when multiplexes became permitted citywide.\n \n(City of Toronto Official Plan)\nRecent data shows people are feeling and seeing the effects of\u00a0NIMBY\u00a0legislation and sentiment.\nAccording to a \nNovember survey\n\u00a0commissioned by non-profit\u00a0Habitat for Humanity Canada, 54 per cent of Canadians feel that NIMBY sentiment is one of the main barriers to making affordable housing available in neighbourhoods, with almost three in four\u00a0agreeing that people worry about the impact of affordable housing on their property values and neighbourhood.\n\"It's actually a really big problem, and it's a problem in every Canadian community,\" said Julia Deans, the non-profit's president and CEO.\u00a0Habitat for Humanity Canada helps\u00a0low-income families access affordable housing.\nCBC Explains\nHow long do Canadians in need have to wait for affordable housing? Depends where they live\nResidents' association takes Vancouver to court over agreement for Squamish Nation-led development\nGarden suites now legal in Toronto after appeal fails. But opponents still speaking out\nKevin Lee, the CEO of the Canadian Home Builders' Association, said despite existing \"appetite\" to build more within existing neighbourhoods, Nimbyism discourages developers from trying to build. In many cases, local opposition to housing developments can \"delay and sometimes completely derail projects.\"\n\"You're going to have so much opposition that it's just\u00a0... not worth the effort,\" said Lee.\nWho is the problem affecting?\u00a0\nCMHC says some Canadians \ndon't\u00a0have the means of accessing the housing\u00a0market\n, which is particularly more common in certain groups, such as people with disabilities. The latest data from the federal government shows \nmore than 250,000 people\n\u00a0are on affordable housing waiting lists across the country.\u00a0\nPeter\u00a0Waldkirch, a director of housing advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says that the people who\u00a0are hurt the most and pushed out\u00a0because of Nimbyism are those without \"power\" in society,\u00a0such as low-income earners, immigrants\u00a0and young people.\u00a0\nIn contrast, he said, those with\u00a0NIMBY views\u00a0often have more wealth, power and resources to advocate for their wants compared to\u00a0the general population and those looking to move into affordable housing developments.\nPoliticians point fingers on housing crisis, but calls growing for more co-operation\nAs rents soar, tenants organize local protests. But what's needed for a national housing movement?\nBut their advocacy may be helping drive the very same system emptying their neighbourhoods and businesses\u00a0and keeping their children and grandchildren from becoming homeowners, he said.\n\"I think a lot of NIMBYs don't realize the harm they are causing.\"\u00a0\nCMHC\u00a0has said at the current pace of construction,\u00a0\nCanada is still short on housing supply\n. It projects almost 2.3 million housing units will be added to the market by 2030, bringing the country's total housing stock to 19 million \u2014 but that's 3.5 million units short of achieving \"housing affordability for everyone living in Canada.\"\nAnd when housing does get built, Waldkirch said\u00a0it's further from cities and their cores and into\u00a0the \"least desirable parts,\" far from jobs and amenities,\u00a0impacting\u00a0the community in ways beyond housing.\n\"It's bad for affordability, it's bad for environment\u00a0and it's bad for the economy,\" said Waldkirch.\nHow do we counteract it?\nDeans says Habitat for Humanity has leveraged different methods to get communities on board with affordable housing projects.\nIn Calgary, the local chapter has sent\u00a0personalized letters from families moving into new affordable housing buildings to local residents, she said.\u00a0In Winnipeg\u00a0branch conducts door-to-door canvassing, public meetings with local residents\u00a0and councillors and invites neighbours to help\u00a0build the very housing units incoming families will inhabit.\n\"That gives them an investment in that home, too,\" said Deans. \"Sometimes communities need a reminder of what their priorities might be.\"\nVolunteer builders with Habitat for Humanity Canada help construct community houses through the Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project in Winnipeg in 2017. \n \n(Submitted by Habitat for Humanity Canada)\nDunn says the rise of pro-housing\u00a0groups and the relaxing of local land zone restrictions\u00a0may be\u00a0a sign NIMBY sentiment is becoming less common. But to keep the momentum going, he suggests giving people less \"recourse\" in legislation to oppose developments and making it easier to finance and build new developments, like Toronto\u00a0multiplexes.\n\"There will be improvement, but there's still some obstacles to overcome,\" said Dunn.\nThat's why\u00a0Waldkirch says it's important for neighbours who say \"yes\" to development\u00a0to publicly support\u00a0new housing projects. This is especially the case for renters and young people, who he said have been \"extremely under-represented\" in municipal elections and in housing planning processes.\nAnalysis\nHow will Canada meet housing targets when there's a construction slowdown?\nBlaming immigration for the country's housing crisis disguises the real problem, analysts say\u00a0\n\"Get engaged. Show up and say 'yes' to housing,\"\u00a0said Waldkirch.\n\"It's easy for people to show up and say 'no' to housing, and that's how it's been for\u00a0decades.\"\u00a0\nLee says at this point in the housing shortage,\u00a0more housing units of all types are needed everywhere, not just in certain places, adding that's why builders, municipalities and provinces need to commit to reducing Nimbyism and\u00a0\"build smartly upwards, inwards and outwards.\"\u00a0\n\"It's definitely not about building a whole bunch of towers. It's not about building a whole ton of single family homes as far as the eye can see either,\" said Lee.\n\"It's finding that happy balance.\"",

The Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association has an RV loan calculator on its website for those who will be financing their purchase.\nEither way, the first step is deciding what kind of RV to go with. There are many types, and their costs vary widely. A new pop-up tent trailer that can be towed behind the family SUV can cost $20,000, while a Class A motorhome is more like a private luxury bus and can cost upwards of $500,000.\n\"Whether you plan to rent or own, ask yourself these four questions,\" said Cyrus Irani, director of digital strategy with Go RVing Canada.\n\"How often do you plan to use your RV? Where will you be using it? What amenities do you need to have? And how many people will be using that RV?\"\nDozens of geared-to-income apartments open in Hamilton for women, non-binary and Indigenous residents\nWhat is NIMBYism and how is it affecting how much housing is getting built?\nOnce you've settled on the type of unit that meets your needs, renting can be a great way to test the waters. Options range from traditional dealerships to peer-to-peer RV sharing websites such as\u00a0RVezy and Outdoorsy.\nRenting can also be a long-term solution if you think you'll enjoy RVing, but won't have the time to go more than once or twice a year. A typical Class C motorhome usually rents for between $1,500 and $2,000 per week, and comes fully equipped with kitchenware, towels and bedding so you don't have to buy all the fixings just to go on a road trip.\nIt's also worthwhile looking into one-way discounts. Some rental companies, such as CanadaDream, will offer heavily discounted one-way rates when they need to move an RV from one fleet location to another.\nIf you think you'll use your unit often, buying can make more financial sense than renting, said Shane Devenish, president of the Canadian RV Association. But he cautioned you should budget for other expenses beyond the purchase price, including fuel, maintenance, and storage fees.\n\"Don't forget insurance and maybe some extended warranty,\"\u00a0Devenish said. \"And there's the upkeep you need to do regularly on an RV just to make sure that it stays a home on wheels, so to speak.\"\nLower\u00a0vacation costs\nMany enthusiasts believe RVing stacks up favourably from an economic perspective when compared to other forms of travel. It allows vacationers to prepare their own food, avoiding the cost of dining out, and skip hotel stays and airfares.\nA 2020 study conducted by research consultancy The Portage Group for the Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association concluded that vacations in tent and travel trailers cost 16 per cent less on average than driving and staying in Airbnbs, 37 per cent less than driving and staying in hotels and 57 per cent less than flying and staying in hotels.\nOf course, actual savings will vary depending on the cost of accommodations at a specific destination, trip length and distance.\nRV travellers can lower their vacation costs significantly by avoiding long road trips in favour of exploring closer to home, as well as by travelling during the spring and fall shoulder seasons instead of the peak summer period.\nShe couldn't find a rental in N.L. So she spent 2 years living in a 20-foot RV\nMore people living in RVs on Vernon, B.C., streets because they can't find a home, housing advocates say\nIrani said it's also worthwhile checking with your RV dealer for campground recommendations. The dealer may have relationships with certain campground operators that offer reduced rates.\nRVing is a luxury, not a necessity, said Nikki Ferreira, who suggested sitting down and seriously crunching the numbers before getting carried away by dreams of the open road.\n\"I definitely don't recommend an impulse decision, like we made,\" she said.\nStill, Ferreira said the advantage of RVing is that you can decide whether you want to pop over to the nearby lake with a gently-used mini teardrop trailer for the weekend, or travel across North America for months in a giant home on wheels.\n\"You're the one who gets to design your travel and what you experience,\" she said.\n\"So keep an open mind. Because you can do it as glamorously or as rustically as you want to. And I do think it's an adventure everyone should experience.\"",

        "content": "The City of Hamilton will pay nearly $3 million in fines and damages for allowing 24 billion litres of sewage and stormwater to spill into Chedoke Creek.\nThe city said in a press release Thursday afternoon it entered a guilty plea in the Ontario Court of Justice related to charges laid by Ontario's Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) in 2020.\nThe city said it reached an agreement with the Crown, which will include a $2.1 million fine, a payment of $364,500 in damages to the Royal Botanical Gardens and a $525,000 victim fine surcharge.\nThe grand total is $2,985,500. Nick Winters, director of Hamilton Water, said the fine must be paid in four months and will be paid using reserve funds.\nMECP spokesperson Gary Wheeler said in an email it is the \"largest fine for a single offence under the Ontario Water Resources Act.\"\nA valve in the city's combined sewer overflow system was left open between 2014 and 2018, causing a layer of biohazardous sediment to settle at the bottom of Chedoke Creek. Chedoke Creek flows into Cootes Paradise and into Hamilton Harbour.\nCourt documents show why valve was left open\nAn agreed statement of facts, provided to CBC Hamilton by the city, state Chedoke Creek had poor water quality before 2018, but that year, the water was getting worse.\nSampling of the creek that spring showed E.coli levels that were 24,500 times greater than the benchmark level cities use to declare water unsafe for swimming.\nThe agreed statement of facts say in early July, someone complained to the province about sewage being discharged into the creek.\nDays after the complaint, Hamilton Public Health Services did its own sampling and declared the water a health hazard.\nThe city brought on a consultant to inspect, which led to them finding the influent well overflow gate was left open at five per cent, when it should've been completely closed.\nWATCH: The combined sewage overflow tank behind the sewage spill\nCheck out Hamilton's largest CSO  tank\n4 years ago\nDuration \n1:06\nHere's a look at the combined sewage overflow tank that leaked around 24 billion litres of runoff and sewage into Chedoke Creek over more than four years.\nCity records show it had been left open since Jan. 28, 2014, according to the agreed statement of facts.\nThere's no log book entry for that date to explain how it happened.\nBut Winters told reporters a guiding document from 2014 had \"improper information\" and stated the system was supposed to be left open at five per cent.\n\"We weren't able to determine why the error was made in that document,\" he said.\nThe agreed statement of facts says the document prevented the problem from being detected earlier.\nHere's a look inside the facility that leaked 24 billion litres of runoff and sewage\nIt was also later found a different gate in the same system that should've been open stayed closed, which allowed even more sewage and rainwater to flow into the creek.\n\"It is clear that the high levels of E. Coli and deterioration of the natural environment between 2014 and 2018 was largely due to this combined sewage discharge,\" read the agreed statement of facts.\nCity apologizes for sewage spill\nCarlyle Khan, general manager of the public works department, told reporters the city accepts \"full responsibility\" for the sewage spill.\n\"We apologize to the community, our partners and members of council for the way the situation was handled and for the resulting environmental impact,\" he said.\nWinters also addressed local Indigenous communities, saying he understands \"there are many that feel disrespected\" but said the city is \"on the right track.\"\nProvince wants Hamilton to implement all recommendations from report on Chedoke Creek\nChedoke Creek clean up resumes after months-long delay\nCity contractors resumed dredging up biohazardous sediment at the bottom of the creek on Thursday after the city said environmental monitoring agreements have been reached with local First Nations groups.\nThe city has said it will finish dredging by the end of October.\nWheeler, MECP's spokesperson, said the ministry is \"pleased that Hamilton has finally begun dredging.\"\nThere have also been other initiatives, including a risk-based proactive inspection program, prompted by the discovery of \nother sewage spills\n late last year and early this year.\nA dredger enters Chedoke Creek.\n \n(Submitted by the City of Hamilton)\nHamilton mayor Andrea Horwath said in a statement the city \"failed\" and the guilty plea is \"encouraging.\"\n\"As I've said before, there was too much secrecy in this case and not enough disclosure,\" she said\n\"Mistakes will happen, but we owe it to the people of Hamilton to own up to those mistakes and demonstrate real change in our approach going forward.\"",

        "content": "The Takhini Bridge fire burning northwest of Whitehorse is now considered \"under control,\" according to Yukon wildfire officials.\n\"Always good to have some good news,\" said wildland fire information officer Haley Ritchie on Tuesday afternoon.\n\"So what they've done is secure the perimeter about 500 feet in ... that really reduces the risk of spread. So they're starting to pull equipment and personnel off that fire.\"\nThe Takhini Bridge fire started a little over two weeks ago in the midst of a heatwave in southern Yukon, and within days it had grown enough to prompt\u00a0an evacuation alert for some parts of the Ibex Valley.\nFortunately, there was soon a bit of relief \u2014 some\n rain helped pause the fire's growth\n while firefighters were building\u00a0a guard around the\u00a0perimeter. Soon after, the fire was declared as being \"held.\"\nMeanwhile, there were three other evacuation alerts in place in the territory on Tuesday, including a new one issued for the Sixtymile area, south of the Top of The World Highway and west of Dawson City. That alert is in response to the Mount Nolan fire.\u00a0\nThe Sixtymile alert applies to areas serviced by the Sixtymile Road and the Matson Creek Road which crosses over Mount Nolan. Ritchie says there is \"mostly industry in the area.\"\nA map showing the area under an evacuation alert as of Tuesday, south of the Top of the World Highway and west of Dawson City.\n \n(Yukon Government)\nAnother alert was issued on Monday for the Dublin Gulch area, northwest of Keno City, Yukon, which is home to Victoria Gold's Eagle mine, as well as several placer mining operations. The nearby East McQuesten River fire was about 2,465 hectares on Tuesday, Ritchie said.\u00a0\n\"Today we've got two helicopters, one initial attack crew and one wildfire officer assigned to this fire.\u00a0What they're doing is communicating with mines in the area, industry, and also assessing structural protection,\" she said.\nEvacuation alert issued for Yukon's Dublin Gulch area, including the Eagle gold mine\nAnother\u00a0evacuation alert remains in place for Kilometres 10 to 35 of the Silver Trail, between Stewart Crossing and Mayo. The alert was issued on July 9.\n\"For now, conditions are pretty stable there\u00a0but we're keeping that evacuation alert in place because it could change,\" Ritchie said.\nShe said parts of the territory have seen some unsettled weather in recent days, and that can increase the risk of fire. The northern part of the territory has seen hot weather along with some lightning, while southern Yukon has seen more rain but also lots of lightning, she said.\n\"Over the past few days, we've seen about 28,000 [lightning] strikes. So that's quite a bit,\" she said.\n\"When we're looking at the board and the Yukon, a lot of strategic decisions are being made. We're a really big territory with a small amount of resources. So it's really important to be strategic.\"",

        "content": "A\u00a0report from the the Correctional Service of Canada\u00a0offers new details of Paul Bernardo's life behind bars \u2014 and what led to the controversial decision to transfer one of Canada's most infamous killers to a medium-security prison.\nAnne Kelly, head of the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), released a review committee's report this week detailing\u00a0the prison transfer that sparked widespread public outrage.\nThe review concluded that CSC followed\u00a0the rules in transferring Bernardo\u00a0but said more could have been done for the\u00a0victims' families,\u00a0who felt shocked and betrayed by the move.\u00a0A lawyer for the\u00a0families\u00a0continues to call for Bernardo to be sent back to maximum security.\nBernardo, a designated dangerous offender,\u00a0is serving a life sentence for kidnapping, torturing and killing Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s. He was also found guilty of the manslaughter and sexual assault of his 15-year-old sister-in-law, Tammy Homolka.\nKristen French, left, was 15 and Leslie Mahaffy was 14 when they were kidnapped, tortured and killed by Bernardo.\n \n(Handout/The Canadian Press)\nKelly said her agency doesn't usually release personal information about inmates, but in a rare move it did so in this case.\n\"In this exceptional circumstance, I have authorized the release of some personal information about this inmate, as I believe it is in the public interest to have a better understanding of the reasons why this specific decision was made,\" she said.\nHere's what the 85-page report reveals about Bernardo's 28 years in prison.\nCorrections Canada could have given victims' families earlier warning of Paul Bernardo's transfer: report\nBernardo's security level was assessed 14 times between 1999 and 2022. One of the tools the corrections system uses\u00a0to determine if an inmate is in\u00a0the right prison is the \"security reclassification scale.\"\nSince 1999, that scale produced a score that recommended Bernardo be classified as medium security. That recommendation was overridden 13 times over 23 years, keeping Bernardo in a maximum-security prison.\u00a0\nThe reason given for maintaining Bernardo at maximum security was his\u00a0own personal safety. Bernardo needed \"significant security measures and restrictions on movement,\"\u00a0the review committee's report said.\u00a0\nWATCH\n | O\nutrage over Paul Bernardo's transfer to medium-security prison:\n\u00a0\nOutrage over Paul Bernardo\u2019s transfer to medium security prison\n2 months ago\nDuration \n2:47\nCanada\u2019s prison service is now reviewing its decision to move notorious serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo from a maximum-security prison to a medium security facility. The transfer has sparked outrage across Canada\u2019s political landscape. Bernardo is serving a life sentence for the murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s.\nThe report said Bernardo was considered an \"inmate in danger\" when he was first sent to the Kingston Penitentiary in 1995\u00a0and he was involuntarily segregated for 18 years until the prison closed.\n\"File information indicates that much of his incarceration has been marked by extremely restricted and controlled interactions with other offenders,\" the review committee's report said. \"Such measures were prompted by safety threats to the offender because of his high profile status and the nature of his offences.\"\nA heavily redacted annex of Bernardo's institutional chronology suggests he was the \"victim\" in a dozen\u00a0incidents between 1995 and 2019.\nHe was classified in prison as a \"conformist.\" That means he's \"been the victim of attempted and actual assaults but has not engaged in violence against other offenders or staff,\" the report said.\nUnauthorized items or contraband have been found in Bernardo's cells three times over the decades.\nIn 1995, a razor blade was found in his cell while he was in solitary confinement in the Kingston Penitentiary. Charges were laid and later withdrawn after a weapon was found in his cell in 2018 at Millhaven Institution.\nBernardo instigated 9 incidents in prison\u00a0\nRecords show Bernardo was the instigator in nine incidents over the past two decades behind bars. He faced nine institutional charges and was found guilty four times in 1999 for disobeying the rules.\nA chain is shown on a segregation cell at the Kingston Penitentiary in Kingston, Ont., on Oct. 11, 2013.\n \n(Fred Thornhill/Reuters)\nThe incidents\u00a0documented include\u00a0a minor disturbance that caused inmates to throw trays,\u00a0making threats in 1998 and involvement in a\u00a0confrontation between two offenders in 2006.\nWhen Bernardo applied for a prison transfer last year, his\u00a0case management team said\u00a0that \"he has remained incident-free for the majority of his sentence, with the last noted concerns occurring four years ago in December 2018, when he was belligerent with staff and refused to return to his cell,\" the review committee report said.\nPsychologist concluded problematic behaviours persist\u00a0\nThe results of Bernardo's score on the \"Severe Sexual Sadism Scale\" \u2014 a\u00a0screening device used by prison officials \u2014\n\u00a0\nare redacted from the review committee's report.\nThe report does say a psychologist concluded that Bernardo participated in \"offence-related programming but continues to exhibit offence-related problematic attitudes and behaviours.... He continues to present with needs in the most relevant domains.\"\nBernardo is shown in a courtroom sketch made during Ontario court proceedings via video link in Napanee, Ont., on Oct. 5, 2018.\n \n(Greg Banning/The Canadian Press)\nThe report cites\u00a0a series of tests conducted in 2023 that concluded Bernardo\u00a0has \"several responsivity issues\" and warned improvements remained \"intermittent.\"\nThe report said Bernardo showed a low potential for reintegration outside the prison system\u00a0and may not fully accept responsibility for his actions. Other tests found he was engaged in his correctional plan and his motivation was rated as \"medium.\"\nA 2014 spousal risk assessment found Bernardo was identified as having a \"high probability of risk for violence towards a partner and a moderate risk of violence toward others.\"\nThe key change that led to Bernardo being transferred to a medium-security prison happened a year ago, the review committee found. On July 20, 2022, Bernardo \"fully integrated\" on the prison range with a larger group of offenders, the report said.\nWATCH\n |\u00a0\nCorrections Canada says rules were followed in Bernardo prison transfer:\n\u00a0\nCorrections Canada says rules were followed in Bernardo prison transfer\n5 days ago\nDuration \n3:05\nThe head of the Correctional Service of Canada, which runs the prison system, says the service followed the rules around the prison transfer of Paul Bernardo. The commissioner of the agency said Bernardo met the criteria for the transfer. However, a review committee said more could have been done to notify his victims' families.\nHe integrated with two groups of 28 offenders and 10 offenders, the report said. That means that, for the first time in his incarceration,\u00a0he went to the yard with everyone from his range, rather than alone.\nThe committee's report said that no security concerns were noted and when there were assaults on the range, Bernardo was not involved.\nWhen assessing an inmate's security level, CSC considers a series of factors, including institutional adjustment (the degree of supervision and control required to manage the inmate in prison), the risk they could escape and the risk to the public if they did escape.\u00a0\nWhen Bernardo's prison transfer was approved, the warden concluded it was appropriate that Bernardo be rated moderate for institutional adjustment, a moderate risk of escaping and a high risk to public safety, the review committee's report said.\nBernardo's request for transfer\u00a0rejected last year\nBernardo asked in 2022 to be transferred to the nearby medium-security Bath Institution in Ontario. That request was rejected.\u00a0\nBernardo was told the prison wasn't suitable because it didn't have locking doors, common washrooms were always accessible to offenders and there were a high number of violent inmates, the review committee found.\nBernardo also was told he could not be transferred to any other prison\u00a0in Ontario because of how notorious his case is in the province.\nHe then set his sights on Quebec, putting in a request to be moved to La Macaza Institution. The review committee's report said that prison was deemed \"compatible\" because it had in the past\u00a0\"safely\" held\u00a0high-profile offenders serving time for sexual offences.\nGuards got no warning of\u00a0Bernardo's transfer\nVictims' families were given a \"heads up\" the morning of Bernardo's prison transfer on May 29. The transfer was kept on a \"need to know\" basis, the review committee's report said.\nWATCH |\u00a0Lawyer for French and Mahaffy families reacts to report on Bernardo transfer:\n \nLawyer for French and Mahaffy families reacts to report on Bernardo transfer\n4 days ago\nDuration \n9:07\nTim Danson, counsel for the French and Mahaffy families, is calling for changes to the law that allowed serial killer Paul Bernardo to be transferred to a medium security prison.\n\"There was a heightened need to be vigilant\" because Bernardo's case is so notorious, the review committee report said.\nTo ensure the the \"safety and security of the escort and the offender,\" staff transporting Bernardo were not told the identity of the offender until the morning of the transfer, the report said. There were also no stops on the way to Quebec during the four-hour-plus drive.\nRisk of escape\u00a0the same at medium-security prison\nBernardo's prison transfer \"does not provide Bernardo with any increased access to the community,\" the review committee's report said.\nJust like a maximum-security prison, La Macaza is surrounded by a high barbed wire fence, and inmates'\u00a0movements are monitored by armed guards, the report said. Kelly said that inmates at La Macaza\u00a0have the same access to visitors, education and programs as inmates in maximum security.\nThe La Macaza Institution is located about 200 kilometres northwest of Montreal in the Laurentian Mountains.\n \n(Pascal Robidas/Radio-Canada)\nThe food there isn't any better either, Kelly said. \"The menu is the same whether you're at maximum, medium or minimum\" she said.\nExperts say Bernardo could spend more time outside of his cell at La Macaza and receive specialized programming for sexual offenders.\u00a0\nVictims' rights could improve after Bernardo's transfer\u00a0\nThe review committee\u00a0found there was nothing stopping the Correctional Service of Canada from sharing more information with the victims' families. It\u00a0recommended striking a working committee to improve practices on engaging with victims and their loved ones.\nThe review committee concluded that it hopes the Correctional Service of Canada reflects on \"victims' considerations,\" including \"courtesy, compassion\u00a0and respect.\"'\nA new ministerial\n order\n \nreleased Thursday is also expected to improve the chances of victims' families being warned in advance of a potential transfer\u00a0so that they can update their victim impact statements. The move to improve victims' rights is something the federal ombudsman for victims of crime has been calling for since the office opened about 15 years ago.\nRead the full report here:\u00a0",

        "summary": "Taylor Powell will make his first CFL start Friday night when Hamilton (2-3) hosts the archrival Toronto Argonauts (4-0).",
        "content": "Taylor Powell was the definition of calm Thursday.\nThe rookie quarterback will make his first CFL start Friday night when Hamilton (2-3) hosts the archrival Toronto Argonauts (4-0). Following the Tiger-Cats walk-through, the 24-year-old Arkansas native gave no indication of having any pre-game jitters or that the moment was too big for him.\n\"I think I'm a pretty chill guy, kind of an outdoorsy guy who's from Arkansas, likes to play football and loves this game,\" he said. \"I guess getting described like that comes from my faith and foundation of who I am.\n\"That's taken time and you have to go through some stuff to develop a sense of character and faith. I'm super grateful for my journey and hopefully it's just getting started.\"\nPowell played in Hamilton's 39-27 road win last week in Edmonton, replacing injured starter Matt Shiltz late in the contest. Powell's first CFL pass was a 17-yard touchdown strike to Tim White as he completed two-of-four passes for 47 yards.\nPowell will become Hamilton's third different starter this season. The Ticats have won two straight while Toronto is the CFL's only unbeaten team.\nThe Argonauts are the defending Grey Cup champions\nToronto also began its Grey Cup defence with a 32-14 home victory over Hamilton on June 18. Powell is looking forward to not only facing the unbeaten Argos but playing in a rivalry game at Tim Hortons Field.\n\"I like to think I'm a competitor,\" he said. \"I'm going to leave it all out there for my team, my coaches and most of all this city and organization.\n\"I'm just going to compete my butt off and have some fun, I'll tell you that. I'm going to have a lot of fun playing.\"\nPowell played collegiately at Missouri, Troy and Eastern Michigan. In 2022 \u2014 his final season at EMU \u2014 he completed 174-of-269 passes (64.6 per cent) for 2,111 yards with 16 TDs and eight interceptions.\nFormer Elk Kai Locksley will be Powell's backup ahead of veteran Antonio Pipkin, who signed with Hamilton this week.\nHamilton is 5-2 in its last seven home games against Toronto, but the Argos have won seven-of-eight overall matchups between the two.\n\"He seems extremely comfortable and so the only thing that's really left is just the test, and that's game day,\" Hamilton head coach/GM Orlondo Steinauer said of Powell. \"He's not out there by himself, we're a team.\n\"There's a lot of other things that go into it, there's a lot of things we can do to help support him and just let his talents take over. We just have to play a cleaner football game and ultimately find a way to come up with one more point.\"\nVeteran Canadian safety Tunde Adeleke returns for Hamilton but at halfback, leaving Stavros Katsantonis at safety. Veteran American defensive lineman Ja'Gared Davis, who was with Toronto last year, won't play for the Ticats.\nPowell faces a Toronto defence that's leading the CFL in turnovers forced (16) and interceptions (11). It's also the league's best against the run (65.3 yards per game).\n\"I think in the back end they play very well together and are always going to be in the right spot,\" Powell said. \"Their linebackers are super smart, very athletic and they're going to get after you up front and stop the run.\n\"There's a reason why they're where they are so we have a great challenge ahead of us.\"\nToronto leads the CFL in offensive points per game\nLinebacker Adarius Pickett, who had 11 tackles in Toronto's season opener, said the Argos' defence isn't taking anything for granted facing a rookie quarterback.\n\"There's some talented football players in this league and you see it all the time where young players step up,\" he said. \"We have to be prepared for any and everything they might come at us with.\n\"We have to make sure we come out and play our game and execute. When we do that, it's very hard to play with us.\"\nTackle Isiah Cage (thigh) will miss a third straight game for Toronto. Defensive linemen Thomas Costigan (ankle), Shawn Oakman (not injury related) and Benoit Marion (thigh) along with Canadian offensive lineman Dylan Giffen are also out.\nStill, Toronto leads the CFL in offensive points (34 per game), net offence (401 yards) and rushing (134 yards) while standing second in offensive TDs (15). The Argos are fourth in passing (275.5 yards per game) but tops in average gain per pass (10.9 yards) and passing efficiency (110.3).\nStarter Chad Kelly was 21-of-25 passing for 351 yards with three TDs and an interceptions in last week's 35-27 road win over Montreal. Conversely, Hamilton's defence is ranked last overall in offensive points (28 per game) and touchdowns (15) allowed and second-last in net offence (381.8 yards), rushing yards (116.4 per game) and passing yards (289.6).\n\"They're a resilient group,\" Toronto head coach Ryan Dinwiddie said of the Ticats. \"They started slow then won the last two so they're rolling again . . . I don't think they'll bat an eye.\n\"We're coming into their building, their fans are going to be excited about it. I'm sure they will be and I'm sure we will as well.\"",

        "title": "Donovan Molloy resigns as N.W.T. judge ahead of misconduct hearing",
        "summary": "Former territorial court judge Donovan Molloy resigned the day before the start of a hearing investigating a complaint about his conduct.",
        "content": "A judicial hearing looking into alleged misconduct from a territorial court judge was derailed by the judge's resignation.\u00a0\nDonovan Molloy, formerly a judge of the N.W.T. territorial court, is the subject of a \n40-page complaint\n alleging a years-long pattern of \"intimidating, insulting and belittling\" behaviour that at times left Crown lawyers in tears and physical distress.\nMolloy tendered his resignation yesterday, citing \nhealth issues\n that had previously delayed the hearing. Molloy has been on an \nindefinite leave of absence\n for the last 14-months.\nMolloy's resignation was accepted and was effective immediately. That means Molloy is no longer a territorial court judge.\nBrock Martland, Molloy's lawyer, and Simon Renouf, the counsel responsible for presenting allegations of misconduct to the hearing panel, argued Monday the hearing would no longer be necessary.\nAccording to the Territorial Court Act, the five-member panel overseeing the hearing could penalize Molloy with a warning, reprimand or removal if they found wrongdoing.\nWith Molloy's resignation, Renouf said those penalty provisions become moot.\u00a0\nHe said Molloy's resignation is effectively a retirement and it's extremely unlikely he would again become a sitting judge in the territorial court.\u00a0\n\"He's left an appointment which is difficult to achieve. There would not appear to be a path for him to reapply to be a territorial court judge,\" Renouf said.\u00a0\nMartland likewise said it would be a strain on public resources to proceed with a multi-day hearing that he said would not serve the public interest.\u00a0\nHe said Molloy now resides in Eastern Canada and would not be attending the hearing.\u00a0\nIf it does proceed, he argued it would be a lopsided hearing without Molloy present, and would involve\u00a0arguments from the complainant but no defence.\u00a0\n\"That is not in the public interest,\" he said, adding that it would be \"unprincipled.\"\u00a0\nEvan McIntyre, representing complainant Martha Chertkow, said the hearing should still go forward.\u00a0\nHe said the \"wounds\" Molloy inflicted from the bench remain despite his resignation and that reprimanding him is important because of the public harm he caused to the territory.\u00a0\nMcIntyre argued the Northwest Territories is a small jurisdiction and the public was aware of Molloy through news stories.\nN.W.T. judicial committee reschedules complaint hearing for judge\nN.W.T. judge showed 'disturbing pattern' of misconduct, lawyer alleges\nWithout the hearing, he said, \"the public will not have sufficient closure or comment on the bad nature of [Molloy's] conduct.\"\u00a0\nThe panel asked the parties to provide written submissions by Sept. 1.\nThe panel, chaired by Justice Karan Shaner, will provide a written decision thereafter. It did not provide a date for when that decision would be made.\u00a0\nShaner said this complaint is the first time this legislation has been used in the Northwest Territories.\u00a0",

        "summary": "Jennifer Timmins often finds herself breaking up fights and managing students with aggressive behaviour, subjecting herself to violence that nearly any other worker would find unconscionable \u2013 and she wants it to stop.",
        "content": "Jennifer Timmins says she often comes home from work with bruises, cuts or scratches that are hard to explain to her three children.\nTimmins works as an educational assistant (EA) at a public school in inner-city Hamilton, a job that goes beyond helping students with their work. She says she often finds herself breaking up fights and managing students with aggressive behaviour, subjecting herself to violence that nearly any other worker would find unconscionable \u2013 and she wants it to stop.\n\"Every day I go in thinking, 'What is my student going to do today? Are they going to give me a concussion or leave bruises all over?\" says Timmins, who says she is hit, slapped, bit, head-butted and kicked routinely. She says one student \"loves to kick you right in your stomach, your private area, wherever he can manage to get hands on\u2026 Holding your hair, ripping your glasses off.\"\nShe has worked as an EA since 2015, and says the situation in schools has become much worse in the last four years, and says\u00a0many of her colleagues are trying to get out. She wears Kevlar protective clothing to work, as do all the other EAs at her school.\nParents at west London public school 'desperate' amid escalating violence in classes\nTimmins believes accepting violence has become an expectation of EAs, even though violence against other school workers is still taken seriously.\n\"If your principal was getting kicked in the privates, or if it was a teacher,\"\u00a0there would be consequences, says Timmins, recalling a time that she and a teacher both got punched while breaking up a fight. The teacher was sent\u00a0home immediately, while Timmins was expected to keep working. \"EAs take the brunt of everything\u2026 I feel like the dirt on the bottom of their feet.\"\nUpper end of salary band is $26.10 an hour; many have second jobs\nTimmins' union, Local 527 of the Canadian Office and Professional Employees, says a \"lack of provincial funding, critical staffing shortages, and limited access to mental health supports are all contributing to the crisis in our schools.\" It released a public statement last month that urged parents to ask their children what kind of violence they have seen at school, saying most would be shocked.\nThe release described \"classrooms being evacuated, students sitting soiled in their own feces, staff unable to work due to injury, principals at their wits end, and a government who chooses to blame parents.\"\nUnion local president Susan Lucek, who worked as an EA until 2019,\u00a0told CBC Hamilton last month that an \"unprecedented\" 59 education assistants from the union resigned this year, a staffing situation made worse by a lack of new recruits taking up the career. This spring, Mohawk College announced it was shutting down its educational assistant program, saying applications had declined dramatically in recent years.\nIs progressive discipline at Ontario schools working? This Grade 8 teacher says no\nLucek said the upper end of the salary band for EAs in her union is $26.10 hourly, adding that is being increased by $1 per hour for each of the next four years.\n\"By the time I retire I may be at $30,\" she said, adding she understands why young people might not want to take on student debt for a job where they know the wages are low and they might face violence. \"A lot of our members work three jobs to make ends meet.\"\n'I don't know what happened to our kids'\nLucek says members have launched work stoppages for unsafe conditions at least twice this year at Hamilton public schools. A recent union survey found 50 per cent of members experience more than one violent incident a day, and that one in five have been discouraged from filing an incident report after such an incident.\nHamilton EA Keira Major says there are few consequences for students who assault\u00a0her colleagues.\n\"They are sent to the principal's office and they... return with stickers or suckers or other tangible things with no disciplinary action,\" she said.\u00a0\"When questioned about this, we are told that they apologized and said they wouldn't do it again or better yet, because of their learning profile we can not discipline.\"\nIn Depth\nWaterloo Catholic board used school resource officers to handle student mental health issues, tantrums: review\nCBC Hamilton reached out to the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board, requesting an interview to discuss these concerns and its expectations and standards around safety for EAs. Communications officer Kim Zarzuela declined, saying\u00a0in an email that the board couldn't comment because it is currently negotiating with Local 527 of the Canadian Office and Professional Employees Union (COPE), which represents the board's EAs: \"As such, we are not able to provide an interview at this time.\"\nWhen CBC Hamilton asked Premier Doug Ford about the issue, during a Hamilton press conference in July, he put the responsibility for curbing violence on\u00a0the school boards.\nDuring a shipbuilding announcement at the Hamilton harbour on July 13, Ontario premier Doug Ford said school boards are responsible for managing school violence.\n \n(Saira Peesker/CBC)\n\"We've hired thousands of new school assistants and educators so we're going to continue to invest in education,\" he said. \"The school boards need to address some of the violence in certain areas.\"\nMajor is so concerned by what she's seen working in Hamilton\u00a0high schools that she's moving her family to a small town in Southern Ontario. She has children with learning differences, and feels that in Hamilton schools, they'll \"get eaten alive\" in a system that is seeing increased antisocial behaviour without increases in discipline and support.\n\"I don't know what happened to our kids, but their minds have snapped,\" she said.\u00a0",

        "content": "A Canadian-born doctor who has been in a protracted battle with medical licensing authorities has finally received the documents she needs to practise medicine in Canada.\nDr. Stephanie DeMarchi, a family doctor who has trained and worked in Australia for the past 10 years, first applied to the Medical Council of Canada (MCC) \u2014\u00a0the body that evaluates medical graduates and physicians \u2014 to have her foreign credentials recognized in April 2022.\nWhat followed was a 17-month wait while the MCC and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO), the provincial regulatory body\u00a0responsible for licensing doctors, reviewed documents such as her university degree, her post-graduate (residency) certificate and resume.\nShe sat for an hours-long test and haggled with officials who were scrutinizing her blemish-free record from a Commonwealth country with a top-notch health-care system.\nAt least one document was rejected by the CPSO\u00a0because\u00a0of how the date on a reference letter was formatted.\nDeMarchi moved her family to her hometown of Hamilton, Ont. in the fall of 2022, thinking the process would be over in a matter of weeks.\nIn May 2023, she had to move back to Australia to keep her licence from that country active. She left her two children and husband behind in southern Ontario.\nCanadian-born family doctor struggles to come home through a wall of red tape\nMeet the Canadian-born doctors who can't work in Canada\nCanada is short of doctors \u2014 and it's turning away hundreds of its own physicians each year\nCBC News \nprofiled DeMarchi's\u00a0quest for a Canadian licence\n at the end of June.\nHer licence from the CPSO came through two days after the story was published.\nReached by phone Thursday, DeMarchi said she was relieved to have her licence in hand.\n\"Can you believe the turnaround time was just 48 hours after the story was published?\" DeMarchi told CBC News.\n\"The CPSO called me the next day and the agent said, 'I'm going to personally see this through.'\"\n\"My journey is over, but what about every other doctor who's trying to be certified and reviewed by the MCC?\" she added, referring to the body responsible for source verification of medical credentials in most provinces.\n\"Especially right now, at this particular time, when there's a massive increase in people who don't have GPs. There are Canadian doctors willing to work and they can't.\"\nDeMarchi, right,\u00a0said she had to move back to Australia by herself to keep her Australian licence current. Her family stayed behind in southern Ontario.\n \n(Submitted by Stephanie DeMarchi)\nShe said the Canadian licensing system is riddled with \"gross inefficiencies,\" with overlapping regulatory bodies sometimes demanding the same documents.\n\"I waited 17 months. Who wants to take a job where the onboarding process is 14 to 17 months? Most people would be like, 'No, no, I'm good,'\" she said.\nThe story prompted the MCC to publicly defend its processing record.\nIt said it has committed to hiring more staff to review applications in a more timely manner, given Canada's acute shortage of doctors.\nFederal\u00a0\ndata suggests\n\u00a0Canada will be short roughly 44,000 doctors \u2014\u00a0including\u00a030,000 family doctors and general practitioners \u2014\u00a0by 2028.\n\"We acknowledge that the current processing times for reviewing documents are longer than what we aim for. We are committed to addressing these longer timelines and are actively recruiting additional staff to improve the processing times and offer our candidates the best possible service,\" the MCC said in a media statement.\nWATCH:\u00a0Canada is losing out on hundreds of qualified doctors each year. Here's why \nCanada is losing out on hundreds of qualified doctors each year. Here\u2019s why\n5 months ago\nDuration \n2:07\nCanada is losing out on hundreds of qualified Canadian doctors trained abroad who can\u2019t practice because they find it difficult to get residencies here due to a combination of red tape and bias.\nThe development means DeMarchi can take over for her mother, a family doctor in Hamilton\u00a0who is due to retire soon. It also means hundreds of patients in the fast-growing city\u00a0won't be left without a doctor.\nDeMarchi didn't wait long to start practising after receiving the necessary paperwork. She's already working alongside her mother in a family health group practice and she has two other locum positions. (A locum is a doctor\u00a0who temporarily fills in for\u00a0another physician.)\nDeMarchi said the whole experience still\u00a0left a \"sour taste\" in her mouth.\n\"It's exhausting. It was an uphill battle. A very long uphill battle. It's certainly taken a toll on me,\u00a0not to mention all the time, money and energy. That energy could have been devoted to building my career in Canada and welcoming new patients,\" she said.\nShe said working\u00a0with those patients reminds her\u00a0that the arduous process ultimately was worth it.\n\"That part is rejuvenating,\" she said.",

        "content": "July 28 will mark 18 years since a newborn baby was found dead beside a Brantford, Ont., street.\nAs the anniversary approaches, Brantford police say they remain dedicated to the investigation and the search to identify the child's mother and/or father, with a renewed appeal to members of the community for information.\nOn July 28, 2005, Brantford police responded to the area of the walking trails near Dufferin Avenue and Parkside Drive, after a citizen discovered the body of a full-term, newborn baby boy.\nAs the identity of the baby is unknown, he was named Baby Parker by officers.\n\"To this date, neither the mother nor the father has been identified,\" police said in a news release on Tuesday.\u00a0\nHundreds of DNA samples collected\nThe death of the baby has since been the subject of an ongoing police investigation.\u00a0\n\"The investigation led to the largest canvass completed by Brantford police. Hundreds of DNA samples were collected from members of the public living in the neighbourhood where Baby Parker was found,\" police said in the release.\u00a0\nThe samples were sent to the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto; however, none were\u00a0found to have a biological link to Baby Parker.\nBrantford police previously released a letter sent in 2005 from a woman who claimed to be Baby Parker's mother.\n \n(Brantford Police Service)\nMeanwhile, police said several 'persons of interest' have been identified over the years but investigators have since eliminated those individuals as being the mother or father.\nExcerpts of a letter collected during the initial phases of the investigation were previously released, with the hopes that someone would recognize the handwriting. The letter, purportedly written by the mother of Baby Parker, indicated that she would be in contact with police in the coming days, but no one came forward.\nOfficers remain committed to solving case\nAccording to the news release, Ontario Provincial Police previously assisted with statement analysis through their Behavioural Sciences Section and generated a profile of the mother.\u00a0\n\"Information previously released to the public indicated that in 2005, the mother may have been between 13 to17 years old, with a connection to the Holmedale neighbourhood,\" police said.\u00a0\n\"The pregnancy was possibly kept secret by the mother from those close to her.\"\nBrantford police say Baby Parker's body was found here, in some bushes about 20 feet from the rail trail at Parkside Drive and Dufferin Avenue in Brantford, Ont.\n \n(Brantford Police Service)\nPolice said although 18 years have passed, \"officers remain committed to finding Baby Parker's mother, father, or anyone else who may have information to assist in providing closure on the case. Police continue to believe that there are members of the public who have information that will be beneficial to the case.\"\nAugust 17, 2023, will mark the 18-year anniversary of the memorial service and date in which Baby Parker was laid to rest.\u00a0\nDetectives remain hopeful that information from the community, combined with the utilization of new investigative technology, may help build a familial lineage to move the case forward.\nAnyone with any information related to the case of Baby Parker is asked to contact Det.-Const. Chris Fleming at 519-756-7050 ext 2851.\nAdditionally, information can also be provided anonymously to Brantford Crime Stoppers by calling 519-750-8477 or 1-800-222-8477.",

Jacobs is the current holder of the title, and was a part of a 20-member delegation from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in Geneva\u00a0to commemorate his predecessor's journey.\u00a0\nDeskaheh's\u00a0petition to League of Nations\nIn 1923, Deskaheh Levi General was sent as a spokesperson to Geneva to petition the League of Nations after exhausting\u00a0all avenues for justice in Canada.\nAn archival photo of Deskaheh in Geneva in 1923.\n \n(City of Geneva/Library of Geneva)\nThe Haudenosaunee Confederacy was concerned about Canada's encroachments on the authority of the Haudenosaunee government, loss of land along the Haldimand tract, and the rights of Haudenosaunee women and children.\u00a0 \nVideo\nSix Nations traditional government wants moratorium on development of Haldimand Tract\nHowever, Deskaheh was never allowed to speak at the League of Nations and his petition sparked a catalyst for Indigenous sovereignty rights at the international level. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945.\n\"He has become a symbol,\" said Kenneth Deer, a member of the Haudenosaunee external relations committee from\u00a0Kahnaw\u00e0:ke, south of Montreal.\n\"The name Deskaheh has been used, has been spoken in the UN for years.\"\nJoe Deom and Kenneth Deer, both Kanien\u2019keh\u00e1:ka (Mohawk) from Kahnaw\u00e0:ke, were a part of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy delegation in Geneva last week.\n \n(Francine Compton/NAJA)\nToday, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy is\u00a0still unable to address the United Nations as a government. The confederacy, along with other Indigenous nations, is\u00a0only eligible to address the UN as a non-governmental organization.\u00a0\n\"It's been a struggle,\" said Deer.\n\"There has been some movement by the United Nations, but not enough.\"\nDeer sits on a committee for enhancing the participation of Indigenous Peoples in the UN that has been lobbying states to create a special status that recognizes Indigenous Peoples as governments so that they can participate at a high level in the UN.\n\"We won't have a right to vote, only members have that, but we will be able to influence resolutions, speak on the floor, or take part in committee work,\" said Deer.\n\"That is the kind of level that we're fighting for.\"\nSteve Jacobs (centre) is the current titleholder of Deskaheh. Both he and Brennan Ferguson (right) addressed the United Nations last week about Indigenous governments not being able to speak in the international body.\n \n(Cathy Richard/Facebook)\nIt's something that Brennan Ferguson, a member of the Tuscarora Nation who also sits on Haudenosaunee external relations committee, addressed at\u00a0the UN last\u00a0week. He argued that the human rights council implement modalities to allow Indigenous Peoples to participate \"with the recognition\u00a0that they deserve.\"\n\"We have treaties with at least four\u00a0states in this room,\"\u00a0Ferguson said to the UN.\n\"NGOs do not sign treaties. This is only the responsibility of governments.\u00a0Indigenous Peoples like the Haudenosaunee should be able to address the human rights council through their own representative institutions.\"\nRelationship with Geneva\nAlthough Deskaheh never got to speak to the League of Nations in Geneva, his visit did spark a relationship with the city. The mayor, Jean-Baptiste Pons, invited him to speak to the people of Geneva.\nThe relationship continues today. In February, the city planted a tree of peace. Last week, they worked with the Indigenous Peoples' Center for Documentation, Research and Information\u00a0(Docip) and the Haudenosaunee Confederacy to mark the centennial anniversary.\u00a0\nHaudenosaunee Confederacy retrieves sacred objects from Geneva museum\n\"For us, this is very important because we're a Geneva-based organization and we've been supporting Indigenous Peoples' work for 45 years,\" said R\u00e9mi Orsier, director of Docip.\n\"The centenary is also a way to show people who know less about this historic period, to learn about it.\"\nLevi General held the title of Deskaheh in 1923.\n \n(Collection of Cleveland General courtesy of Richard Hill)\nThe Haudenosaunee flag was erected along Mont-Blanc bridge\u00a0and there were receptions, a march through\u00a0the city, and the opening of new photo exhibition illustrating Deskaheh's story\u00a0along Quai Wilson.\n\"Support for Indigenous Peoples is part of the City of Geneva's commitment to human rights and the self-determination of peoples,\" said Alfonso Gomez, mayor of Geneva, in a statement.\nThe photo\u00a0exhibition, which features 30 large panels along Lake Geneva, is curated by Jolene Rickard.\nFrom July 3 to Aug. 16, the photo exhibition 'Deskaheh in Geneva 1923-2023: Defending Haudenosaunee Sovereignty' is set up at Quai Wilson in Geneva.\n \n(Submitted by  R\u00e9mi Orsier)\nRickard, who is Skaru\u0300\u00b7re\u0328\u0294 (Tuscarora) and a professor at Cornell University in New York state, said\u00a0it was important to include a mix of contemporary and historic photographs.\n\"Although it focuses on the historic aspects of this relationship, it also provided an opportunity to focus on the work that is currently going on and continues to be done,\" said Rickard.\n\"The exhibit demonstrates our persistence, that as a people\u00a0we are in it for the future.\"",

        "summary": "CBC Hamilton heard from Ameil Joseph, an associate professor in the school of social work at McMaster University, and Gessie Stearns, a homelessness researcher \u2014 both of whom have concerns with Hamilton's approach to encampments.",
        "content": "As Hamilton wrestles with\u00a0worsening homelessness and how to address it, city councillors are poised to finalize a plan next month\u00a0to deal with a growing number of encampments.\nIn June, the city held three\u00a0in-person public consultation sessions and had an\u00a0\nonline survey\n\u00a0open for people to share their thoughts and offer feedback on the plan.\nThe plan works off the idea that without help from the province and federal government, encampments aren't going away anytime soon.\nLacking affordable housing, emergency shelter space and\u00a0mental health supports, as well as an ongoing opioid crisis have created the current conditions, the city previously said.\nIt has put money into house, created an opioid action plan and declared states of\u00a0emergency related to homelessness, opioid addiction and mental health to try and get extra funding.\nHamilton's community meetings are supposed to be part of the feedback the city is using to create recommendations for councillors in August.\n \n(Samantha Beattie/CBC)\nWhile waiting for a long-term solution, \nthe city's proposed encampment plan\n\u00a0explores the idea of sanctioned encampment sites and rules for encampments that aren't in sanctioned areas.\nA staff report with a recommended plan and summary of the feedback\u00a0is due to be presented in August.\u00a0\nBut the plan \u2014 and its public consultation process about the plan \u2014 is facing\u00a0some\u00a0criticism.\nAmeil Joseph, an associate professor in the school of social work at McMaster University and Gessie Stearns, a homelessness researcher, both\u00a0have concerns\u00a0with the plan and process.\nIn a conversation with CBC Hamilton, they said the current discussions treat encampments like an eyesore instead of being more focused on creating housing.\u00a0They also say there should be more transparency.\nSome of that conversation is here. It\u00a0has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nHow would you summarize the state of homelessness and housing in Hamilton?\nJoseph: \nThe state is terrible.\u00a0The state is one that will produce people dying. Sometimes there are allusions to the fact shelters are over capacity or there are thousands of people on a waitlist for housing or waiting for an application to be processed without housing possibilities. People are spending 50 per cent of their income on renting. All these things together remind us of the historical context where we've been pulling out of addressing matters of housing for some time \u2014 income support, people with disabilities, ODSP, housing provisions, all inadequate over several years. These things are cascading upon one another without a coherent strategy.\nPeople facing homelessness in Hamilton describe what they want the city to do\nStearns:\n We focus on homeless people as the problem, and not on the way in which we develop our community or the way in which we plan all kinds of other things. It erases the idea that housing is actually what we need. We have inclusion policies and ideas of what belonging looks like in Hamilton and none of these plans and processes don't actually reflect any of that. We silo many of the things going on in our community as though they're distinct items and as a result, we focus on people's inability, trauma and drug use, rather than looking at many of the core reasons why we are where we are today.\nStorm Mallinson, right, stands next to his partner, as they shared their story about being unhoused and explained what they wanted the city to do to help combat Hamilton's homelessness issue.\n \n(Bobby Hristova/CBC)\nWhat do you think about the city's plan and\u00a0consultation process?\nJoseph:\n We see people outside as something broken that needs to be fixed rather than our policies, programs and resourcing infrastructure that is a problem that needs to be fixed. The consultations are about how do we identify and police those people outside and remove them and place them somewhere else. Every one of these consultations, people are saying, \"I live outside, no one has offered me anything, I can't afford any option talked about and none of this makes sense.\" What about housing? We offer them no guarantee or provision or plan for how they can access anything they need at all.\nYour questions answered on encampments and Hamilton's proposed plans\nStearns: \nConsultation happened, housing wasn't on the table. There are rooms full of people with the will to start talking about solutions, but we're always told housing is not one of them. We were told to not talk about housing all along the way and the reason we were given is we'd have to draw from provincial and federal governments to do that and we're waiting. We're never quite pulling together all the ways we build this community in an inclusive way that people can belong. The way the current documents to draw upon are written, with five metres here or 50 metres there, leaves the responsibility of finding a space to people outside. What we have are a set of prohibitions never quite looking to how we're developing.\nAmanda Clarke is unhoused. She previously said she has had trouble accessing services to help her and also said people in encampments face violence daily \u2014 from people who are homeless and people who aren't. \n \n(Bobby Hristova/CBC)\nIs something different possible? What does that look like to you? And what do we do next?\nStearns: \nWhat are we doing here waiting for levels of government that aren't responding to this scathing Auditor General of Canada report that says we don't really know if we're doing the thing we set out to do? In this community, we need to be having conversations about how to address the needs of folks we're seeing struggling now. There's the ability to have more transparency to have these discussions. There's a lot of will but this consultation process has not laid out a path for us to have these conversations.\nHamilton man stabbed at Woodlands Park encampment in critical but stable condition, police say\nJoseph: \nWhen people are telling you over and over again there are a number of ways we can weigh in differently, that's where we need to think about how to get to. The pass the buck kind of conversations where we can't talk about provincial, federal and municipal issues continuously is a strange entry point. It's not just the case we need Ontario Works and ODSP to be higher amounts, it's also the case we can take municipal funding programs and make them livable for people on social assistance in terms of cost by re-sourcing how they're funded ...\u00a0rather than retreating to \"how do we get rid of these people we see as the worst?\"",

It was collected through freedom of information (FOI) requests by two Toronto-based organizations \u2014 Downtown Legal Services and Parkdale Community Legal Services.\nBRAMPTON\nBrampton international student alleges restaurant stole $18K worth of her wages\nBRAMPTON\nHow this international student fought for $16K in unpaid wages \u2014 and won\nExperts and those affected by wage theft are concerned that the exploitative practice of not paying employees has become the norm, and they worry it's getting worse.\nOntario's Ministry of Finance says it acknowledges that unpaid wages are an issue and is introducing measures to help counter the problem.\u00a0Advocates say the provincial response is far from enough and that for some workers the measures come too late.\u00a0\nKaur alleges she wasn\u2019t paid any of her wages after leaving her job, despite multiple efforts to get in touch with the employer. She says her case has been under investigation for more than a year now under the Federal Labour Program.    \n \n(Submitted by Simranjeet Kaur)\nKaur said without her wages, she had to resort to asking friends for help.\n\"For groceries, for rent, for my car instalments and insurance, everything was paid for by my friends,\" she said. \"I asked them to help me out, and now, I am paying them back.\"\nNaujawan Support Network, an Ontario-based group of immigrants fighting wage theft, pushes\u00a0for stricter enforcement of rules compelling employers to pay workers the wages they're owed. They help people who register complaints about unpaid wages with the province and also those who file complaints at the federal level, such as\u00a0Kaur.\nIn the just over two years\u00a0NSN has been in operation, the migrant collective says it has recovered $323,209 in owed wages for 74 members. The group directly confronts employers accused of wage theft by delivering letters and staging protests, boycotts and social media pressure campaigns.\u00a0\nGrowing concern wage theft becoming the norm\nAnmol Sanotra, a member of NSN, says newcomers are more vulnerable when it comes to wage theft, but the problem affects everyone\n\"Interestingly, we have been contacted by everyone \u2014 not just international students or work permit holders, but even by citizens,\" he said.\u00a0\nNSN says the data obtained through FOI requests shows there has been a steep decline in the number prosecutions for non-compliance with the Ontario Ministry of Finance's orders to pay \u2014 down from 79 prosecutions in 2017-18 to 12 prosecutions in 2021-22. In 2020-21, prosecutions dipped to a low of two.\nIn a letter to the Ministry of Labour last month asking for a meeting to discuss wage theft, NSN said one trait that appears to unite these employers is their attitude toward the ministry.\u00a0\n\"They regard the ministry as weak and ineffective \u2014 an institution that cannot enforce the orders it issues, and that will not prosecute employers who ignore the orders,\" the letter read.\u00a0\nMembers of the Naujawan Support Network met with provincial labour ministry representatives in June this year to discuss wage theft. NSN member Anmol Sanotra, seen above in a blue shirt, said the ministry told them it was aware that unpaid wages were an issue, but didn't provide specifics about how it was being addressed. \n \n(Submitted by Anmol Sanotra)\nClaims reached historic low during pandemic: ministry\nAccording to the data interpreted by NSN, the number of investigations into employment standards completed by the ministry dropped by roughly 50 per cent from 2014 to 2021.\u00a0\nAccording to Sanotra, the group wanted to know why there was such a \"shocking\" drop. He said that when they eventually met with ministry officals late last month,\u00a0they were told that the ministry was\u00a0aware of unpaid wages\u00a0being an issue, but\u00a0didn't provide specifics about how it was being addressed.\u00a0\nHe says if the ministry knows about wage theft, \"it's their job to investigate and plug those loopholes that are being exploited by the employers.\"\u00a0\nThe Ministry of Labour said in an email to CBC News that it has recovered more than $110 million in wages and other money owed to employees over the last five fiscal years.\u00a0\n\"Employees are entitled to be paid for the work that they do and we investigate any and every claim for unpaid wages,\" the email said.\u00a0\nIt said one reason for the declining numbers of completed investigations, and subsequently, the number of prosecutions, is that during the COVID-19 pandemic, it received a historically low number of claims.\u00a0\nOntario to tighten rules for temp agencies, firms that recruit foreign workers\nAccording to a media \nstatement\n released earlier this month, the ministry said its inspections have shown that multiple temporary agencies in Ontario are illegally paying people below the minimum wage and denying other basic employment rights to gain an unfair competitive advantage over law-abiding agencies.\u00a0\nAs a step to counter this practice, the announcement says roughly 2,300 temporary help agencies and recruiters of temporary employees across the province will require a licence to operate as of Jan. 1, 2024.\nWhile applying for the licence, the agencies will be required to submit $25,000 in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit that can be used to repay wages owed to employees.\nMore enforcement needed\u00a0\nLeah Vosko, a political science professor at York University who researches labour rights, says more needs to be done to ensure minimum employment standards are followed, especially as the cost of living rises.\n\"It's shocking to me that employees for whom there are orders to pay wages often don't receive their wages,\" she said via\u00a0email.\u00a0\nOften, there aren't enough resources to make sure rules are enforced, Vosko said, adding that when those minimum standards aren't met, it can become something that's seen as normal and acceptable.\nWATCH | Temporary foreign workers vulnerable to mistreatment, expert says:\u00a0\nLabour shortage fuelling huge increase in temporary foreign workers\n1 month ago\nDuration \n1:49\nFaced with a pandemic-induced labour shortage, businesses in the Rocky Mountain tourist hot spots of Banff and Canmore, Alta., have been given the green light to dramatically boost the number of temporary foreign workers they hire to fill low-wage positions.\nIn Kaur's case, she says she knew something wasn't right.\u00a0\nShe came to Canada from India in 2017 and started at Northedge Logistics, a transportation company in Caledon, Ont., in 2021. She says she worked there for two months before quitting.\u00a0\nKaur alleges she wasn't paid any of her wages when she left, despite multiple efforts to get in touch with the employer.\u00a0\n\"There was a lot of mental stress.\"\u00a0\nPretty Grewal, director of Northedge Logistics, said via email that all allegations of wage theft were false.\u00a0\n\"We haven't kept a single dollar for anyone, but in this case it's a matter of ethics, integrity, and the trust we put on them when we hire,\" Grewel's email said. \"Now, they have put false allegations on us so we are dealing with the proper authorities.\"\nWhat happens after a complaint is made\nKaur says her case has been under investigation for more than a year now under the Federal Labour Program.\u00a0\nThe Labour Program, administered by Economic and Social Development Canada, said it couldn't comment directly on Kaur's case, citing confidentiality under Canada's Labour Code.\u00a0However, the program's website explains that once federally regulated employees file a\u00a0complaint, if it's found admissible, the Labour Program will investigate.\nIf the complaint is founded, the program contacts the employer and asks it to voluntarily pay wages owed. Failing that, the\u00a0program can issue\u00a0a payment order, a legal document filed\u00a0in the Federal Court of Canada. This means it has the same effect as if it were a judgment obtained in that court.\nThe government \npublicly lists\n the cases where the total amount owed exceeds $5,000. Since 2020, there have been 41 employers with payment orders filed in Federal Court.\nIn an emailed statement, the Labour Program said it is \"taking action against non-compliant employers who are short changing their employees through tactics like wage theft,\" the email said.\nScott Blodgett, spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of Finance, said in an email that the ministry makes every effort to recover what's owed to claimants under the Employment Standards Act.\u00a0If employers don't pay up, he said the ministry \"may take legal actions to collect monies owing.\"\nNSN's Sanotra says the government should be doing a better job.\u00a0\n\"The ministry has the authority, it has the options,\" he said. \"It's not our job to stand up against the employers.\"",

CBC teams have installed temperature and humidity sensors in dozens of homes in several cities, including Windsor, Ont., to see just what happens to people when things go from hot to sizzling to seriously dangerous. This is one of those stories.\u00a0\nTrade sunbathing, sweet treats and cooling off indoors with vertigo, migraines, and insomnia.\nThose are the signs of summer for Windsor's Jessica Mailloux-Lesperance, who was forced to remove her air conditioning last spring\u00a0and could not afford a replacement.\nIt's a situation a lot of households in Ontario may face if they live in a multiple-storey residence, due to new housing legislation introduced\u00a0in Toronto in 2019.

I was in bed a lot through most of the summer.\"\nWhen Mailloux-Lesperance moved into her apartment with her husband James and cat Spook, they had a window unit for air conditioning. In the spring of 2022, they received a letter informing them that the unit had to be removed.\nA portion of a letter from Skyline Living explaining the risks of window air conditioners.\n \n(Obtained by CBC News)\nIn 2019, the Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) started removing units like the one Mailloux-Lesperance used to have, \nafter an improperly installed wall AC caused the death of a toddler\n.

Chatham Sports Hall of Famer Mel Wakabayashi passed away earlier this month at the age of 80. His nephew Dwight joins us in the few moments, to tell us more about his impact on the ice and how he made the sport more diverse.\nDwight Wakabayashi is Mel's great nephew and a\u00a0sports writer from Chatham. He\u00a0joined \nWindsor Morning\n host Nav Nanwa\u00a0to reflect on Mel's legacy.\nDwight, first and foremost, condolences to you and your family. If you can describe your great uncle with one word, what would that be and why?\nWell, you you took it, it's \"great,\" probably. The other one would probably be \"accomplished.\" Mel has always been associated with\u00a0all the great things that he's done. Not just, not just sports wise, but just in the business world and you know, the way he's carried himself through his life and you know, he was the president of the Prince hotels and he was also vice president of hockey in Japan and for the federation there.\nSo he's just always kind of been known as\u00a0great Uncle Mel or just by the great things that he does, tries to do. And then, you know, he was already quite accomplished when I came along. So he's just always been known as someone who just, you know, he's always striving.\u00a0Yeah, someone to look up to for sure.\n \nTell me a bit about Mel and his upbringing and how he ended up in Chatham.\nHe was actually born in one of the [Japanese internment] camps in B.C. and it was Slocan city. And he\u00a0wasn't even a year old before they moved. They actually gave a choice for some of the people that were interned, if they wanted to go to Ontario, and so they picked to go\u00a0Neys, Ontario, a camp near Thunder Bay.\n[It] ended up being eight of them, but it was only a few of them at the time. I think three of my my aunts and uncles and my dad included, actually, but he ended up in Thunder Bay when he was one.\nAnd then in 1950, there was also an opportunity. They asked,\u00a0do any of you want to go to Southern Ontario? There's land there. And so, my family ended up in Chatham and that was when Mel was... [in 1950], he was seven years old, I believe.\u00a0\nWith the camp life,\u00a0I\u00a0know that there was always talk that they were always together and playing sports. I'm not too sure how they learned, what they used or anything, but I know that my grandpa was big into baseball and\u00a0 they played sports in the camps.\u00a0\nBut I think\u00a0in Chatham in 1950, when they arrived there, that's when the sports really started to pick up.\nIs that how he got into hockey, eventually?\nYes,\u00a0I'm pretty sure. Like, I think hockey was [played] a little bit when they were in B.C. when they were growing up.\u00a0There was always hockey from my grandpa,\u00a0and then I think that they played a little bit and just with the older people in the camp, there was some hockey \u2014 like the skill set. But then when they came to Chatham, I know that's when the hockey really started to develop.\nAnd then, the timing of it was perfect for Mel because when he was 16, the Chatham Maroons were\u00a0formed. That was like the first team. They were just starting to get it going.\u00a0\nYeah, he would go on to eventually play for the Chatham Junior\u00a0Maroons and then eventually he went over\u00a0to the University of Michigan, where I know he really made an impact as a Wolverine. Do you want to maybe touch on his time there?\nYeah, well I know Al Renfrew was the coach at the time, and\u00a0he took the time to come to Chatham and watch Mel play and then I think he immediately wanted him on the team. But because of the university rules, my uncle couldn't start until later in the semester.\nSo he actually had a late start to his hockey career. But he jumped in right away when he joined the team in January, and and just started pumping in the points and I think my uncle through his time in Michigan he was known for his offence, I mean his pure dynamic speed and offence and also the way that he played the game at the time.\nI think he got one penalty in his whole university career. So I used to joke with him actually because, you know,\u00a0it's a badge of honour for him. But I used to bug him because I used to tell him that he wasn't involved in the play enough, right? That was always my shot back to him. But yeah, he was just a speedy guy.\nHe put up huge numbers at the university. And the thing was, in his first year they won the title and I think it was '64. And they\u00a0won the title against University of Denver and in the finals he actually potted two goals. So that's kind of a big thing. Like,\u00a0my family, especially my uncles ... they always talked about, you know, you could play the whole year and get lots of points and lots of wins and everything, but but when it came down to the end, like in the crunch time\u00a0did you show up?\nSo I that was a big thing with my uncle that he got two goals and the national and the national title game. It was just a star at Michigan, a lot of accomplishments.\nAnd it wouldn't end there, right? Like, you know, he would then go get drafted to the Detroit Red Wings. But then he decided to play in the Japan Ice Hockey League and then eventually led to him coaching the Japanese hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. Dwight, you wrote a pretty extensive post about him on your sports blog awakafightermma.com, titled A Life with Uncle Wolverine. What are you going to miss the most?\nWell, with Uncle Mel,\u00a0 I wasn't able to spend a lot of time with him. I spent a lot of time with his son Chris, my cousin. Him and I grew pretty tight in the in the earlier years, but the thing\u00a0with Uncle Mel is and with both my uncles, is you just always knew that they were out there spreading the\u00a0Wakabayashi vibe, you know what I mean?\nLike they were just out there at high places, letting it be known the the Wakabayashi way, which is like, you know, the way to treat people.\u00a0With my uncles, it's like, you're not going to get the love unless you're doing something right, like unless you're doing something you know? So that was with Uncle Mel, I'm going to miss that.\n\u00a0",

The department has an \"all hands on deck\" callout for staff to help get the region cleaned up this weekend.\u00a0\nDamage reported across region after heavy storm rolls through southwestern Ontario\n\"We've had some major rain events in the last few years, but as far as wind and damage, this is definitely something that that has not happened in awhile,\" Van Gaver said.\nResidents can help by being patient with first responders as they get debris cleaned up, Van Gaver said. And if they're bringing downed tree limbs to the street for collection, sorting them into large and small piles can help crews handle them more efficiently.\u00a0\n\"We're making every effort we can to get this cleaned up as quick as we can.\"",

Events will be held across Windsor-Essex throughout the week as part of the festival.\n \n(TJ Dhir/CBC)\nOn the support of local politicians, a member of the festival's board of directors said that the government needs them and they need the government.\n\"Teamwork makes the dream work,\" said Mariam Adam.\nVisitors are coming from all over the world not only to participate in the week's events, but also to help organize it.\n\"Everybody's done such a good job,\" said Chuckly Shyngle, an actor based in Leeds, England. \"I've obviously been in England, but we've got a group and I've been in touch with them, so I know how hard they've worked to make this happen.\"\nMariam Adam is a member of the board of directors for WIDAFest. She says it's a good thing that the government is supporting the festival.\n \n(TJ Dhir/CBC)\nAfrican vendors are also expected to showcase their wares.\n\"There are\u00a0gonna be vendors to sell their products and looking for partners who have stores here in Windsor or across Canada to do business exchanges,\" said Adam. \"If you are a businesswoman or a businessman, come here. You will learn how you can do trade locally and internationally.\"\nSaturday will also have the main feature of the festival: a parade heading down Riverside Dr. from Devonshire Rd. to the Riverfront Festival Plaza.\n\"We have Yellow Moon all the way from Barbados right here to do drumming,\" said Adam. \"So if you are a drummer, come and join the drumming. If you love cultural music, come and join. If you love the food, come and join. If you like to see your city shining and glowing, come because it's a grand opening for bringing the culture and business together.\"\nQueen Amina Eghujovbo and Mariam Adam, two organizers of WIDAFest, dancing with members of the Oakville Soccer Club's U19 League 1 team. The team was in Windsor for a tournament when Adam and Eghujovbo came up to them to talk about the festival.\n \n(TJ Dhir/CBC)\nPart of the festival's goal is to be a zero-waste event.\u00a0Eghujovbo\u00a0says coming from the hot climate of Nigeria, she wants to to try and stop climate change and has used this as a way to get there.\n\"We are going to try to make sure that everything that is used is reusable and compostable,\" she said. \"So we're trying to avoid people bringing in plastic water bottles; rather we have bottled waters that we can refill their water bottles.\"\nWIDAFest already has some fans from the Greater Toronto Area.\n\"They came up [with] really great energy,\" said Abby Bertin, captain of the U19 League 1 team from the Oakville Soccer Club. \"[It was] super nice to meet everyone and learn a bit about the community and culture over here as well.\"\nFor more stories about the experiences of Black Canadians \u2014 from anti-Black racism to success stories within the Black community \u2014 check out\u00a0Being Black in Canada, a CBC project Black Canadians can be proud of.\u00a0\nYou can read more stories here\n.\n \n(CBC)",

Windsor tax expert breaks down the process\n\"So things are actually getting better. Obviously a lot of people are focusing on the 9.1 per cent, but things are actually improving.\"\nThe consumer price index (CPI) said food prices were\u00a0up 9.1 per cent in June, from nine per cent in May \u2014 even as the overall inflation rate slowed to 2.8 per cent year over year.\u00a0\nSome categories driving food inflation\nCharlebois said some categories of food are more influential in the overall rise of food prices, like fruits and meat in June. Before that, bakery and vegetables were driving increases.\u00a0\nWindorites reached by CBC News said there are a few categories in which they're cutting back spending.\u00a0\n\"I don't buy a lot of meat products anymore, I don't buy a lot of frozen stuff, because of the fact that prices are so high,\" said Kevin Shelson.\u00a0 \nThe Signal\n54:59\nAMA with the food professor\nThe show starts with DFO scientist Jack Lawson giving folks safety advice for being on the water around whales. Then it's an AMA with the food professor Sylvain Charlebois from Dalhousie's Agri-Food Analytics Lab.\nMike Denyer said he's noticed the price of chips going up\u00a0and will shop around to get the best deal.\u00a0\n\"I use Flipp [a grocery flyer app] a lot to see what's on sale and who has it on sale, and take into consideration what will it cost for me to drive over there, because even gas isn't the cheapest,\" Denyer said.\u00a0\nHe said global events have been shocking to the supply chain, including COVID-19\u00a0and the war in Ukraine.\u00a0\nBut while Canadians are certainly feeling the pinch of higher food prices, Canada has one of the lower food inflation rates.\u00a0\nInflation behind record food bank use in Windsor, says unemployed help centre\nCan you grow your own food to beat inflation? It depends\n\"We actually have the lowest food inflation rate within the G7 after the United States, and so I know that a lot of people are concerned about food prices, but Canada actually has done fairly well.\"\nCharlebois said\u00a0experts are forecasting that things might calm down before the end of the year.\u00a0\n\"We're getting there. It's going to take some time. In terms of forecasting, we are expecting to finish the year 2023 with a food inflation rate below seven per cent nationally \u2026 so we're headed in that direction.\"",

Robinson said he recently heard about the group and the two discussed mutual concerns about things going on in school.\n\"I think it showed on June 1\u00a0that it's not just a small minority of right-wing bigots,\" said Robinson.\nRobinson created his group because of the Greater Essex County District School Board's (GECDSB) gender expression policy. The policy, which has\u00a0been in effect since 2016, states that students at any age can use a different name, gender or pronouns at school without the parents' knowledge.\nIt's one of the issues that prompted \nduelling protests last month\n outside of the board office.\nBut what happened at Northwood last month is now gaining attention\u00a0again.\nAudio recording exposes teacher\nTrue North, an independent online media outlet,\u00a0released audio that appears to be taken by a\u00a0student at that school where a teacher expresses \"disgust\" that so many of them were absent from school when the Pride flag was being raised.\nCBC News has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the recording.\nThe audio appears to depict a teacher saying the statement made by skipping school\u00a0amounts to hatred and was \"incredibly disgusting.\" Students, some of whom said they're Muslim, can be heard saying they aren't being hateful. Instead, they said their religion doesn't allow them to support LGBTQ people.\nVideo\nGender identity policy divides crowds outside Windsor school board's first closed meeting\nIn an emailed statement , the GECDSB\u00a0said it was made aware of this incident when it happened in early June. A spokesperson said administration reached out to staff, students and community members to ensure \"their well-being.\"\nPrincipal apologizes to families\nThe board sent out a letter was to parents, apologizing about the incident. It said inappropriate comments were made that \"do not reflect the values of acceptance [and] inclusion.\"\n\"As stated in the letter, diversity and a sense of belonging enrich students' learning experiences, and we are committed to ensuring that all students and families are represented positively in our schools. We cannot comment on personnel matters relating to any staff member, but this incident is being addressed internally,\" said GECDSB communications officer Madeline McEachern.\nSuperintendent of education Clara Howitt\u00a0tells CBC News she cannot confirm if the teacher is still at the school or in the same classroom. However, the board said \"this incident is being addressed internally.\"\nSupport for Pride flag\nThe board overall asserted its support for the Pride flag and LGBTQ rights last month.\u00a0\n\"We care about everyone and their rights to freedom, security and safety,\" said Erin Kelly, director of education, in a statement on the website.\u00a0\nThe president of the Windsor Pride board said in June that he was surprised so many students were out of school.\n\"It does send a message to the 2SLGBTQ students that attend most schools that the school isn't behind them and that their peers and the family members in their community are not supportive of their identities,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"Windsor-Essex has such a strong community and some amazing services led by some amazing individuals, and so I am surprised about the number.\"",

It's a very challenging endeavour, but it is not so challenging that it can't be done, and done successfully and done with great enthusiasm and and and and longevity,\" Robert said.\u00a0\n\"There's so many rewards over the course of the ups and downs of a journey like this. I can't imagine not having done this in our lives and continuing to do it. It is truly the coolest thing I've ever done.\"\nBoth the LaBrecques and Ross said people often imagine that foster families are in it alone, when that couldn't be further from the truth: There's training, both mandatory and optional, as well as a case worker assigned to assist foster parents and kids, and a local foster association parents can draw on for tips and advice.\u00a0\nRebecca Ross is the foster parent recruiter with the Windsor-Essex Children's Aid Society. She said the organization is partnering with PrideFest to get the word out to diverse families about the opportunity to foster, amid a shortage of foster parents. \n \n(Kathleen Saylors/CBC)\nAnd while WECAS is\u00a0actively recruiting for foster families, Ross said the best scenario is working with families preventatively keep children in homes. From there, they'll look at kinship options for safe adults who have relationships with the child before placing the child into foster care.\u00a0\n\"That's when we want to make sure that we have safe homes where we could make the best cultural or religious match possible,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"The bigger the pool of foster parents with a wider range of diversity, the better the matching can happen,\" Ross said.\u00a0\nRoss said they're looking for all types of stable and supportive homes, and prospective foster parents need to come from a place of stability in order to offer that to kids.\u00a0\nIf someone's really thinking about it, I would definitely say come forward, talk to us, have that conversation, let us know what it is that's stopping you and we can kind of talk that out,\" Ross said.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"We absolutely love it when people come and reach out to us and say, hey, I've been thinking about this, I'm not sure.

It says\u00a0that administration had reviewed the all-way stop policy which was last approved in 2005. It\u00a0had already been identified for review.\n\"In the past, installing all-way stops were seen as the solution to many traffic problems,\" the report reads but goes on to list how all-way stop controls have negative effects and can often lead to poor stop sign compliance, more rear-end collisions and speeding.\u00a0\nWard 2 city councillor Fabio Costante says his effort to lower the threshold to get a new all-way stop installed may have had the opposite effect.\n \n(Submitted by Fabio Costante)\n\"The unnecessary delay from a stop sign results in motorists increasing their travel speed between intersections to make up for the perceived time lost,\" the report read.\nIf city council ultimately accepts staff recommendations, Windsor's all-way stop policy would mirror that of the province, which has stricter criteria. Request for four-way stops related to speeding would be dealt with through the city's\u00a0traffic calming policy.\nCreatures of habit\nCarl Berkowitz, who is a transportation and traffic engineering expert, said that people will disobey un-needed stop signs.\n\"People become creatures of habit and if they find that there's an unreasonable reason for the stop sign, they'll ignore it,\" he said.\nThe city also said there are 17.4 million kilograms of carbon emissions caused by all-way stops yearly\u00a0and each stop sign in the city costs $500 to maintain.\nThe report said that other tools and practices have come about since 2005 to keep pedestrians and students safe and speeding down.\nIt lists measures such as speed humps, raised crosswalks and curb or sidewalk extensions among measures that could address speeding and/or pedestrian safety while also eliminating the installation of \"an otherwise unwarranted all-way stop.\"",

        "content": "Despite often being described as smelly and not nice to look at, Eric Hirzel and Matthew Hehn say they find algae blooms helpful when it comes to catching more fish in Lake Erie.\nBoth are longtime charter fishing captains\u00a0who patrol the lake's western basin, primarily pulling walleye (pickerel) and yellow perch from the water.\nAlgae blooms are caused when algae grow\u00a0quickly in water systems from excess nutrient run-off, like phosphorus or nitrogen from fertilizer.\u00a0\nOne of the largest recently recorded algal blooms in western Lake Erie occurred in 2017.\nEric Hirzel, left, and Matthew Hehn are fishing charter captains in western Lake Erie.\n \n(Eric Hirzel/Matthew Hehn)\nHirzel, from Ohio, said\u00a0if the blooms get thick enough, they provide enough shade that fish often accumulate underneath the green slime, making it easier to hook them.\n\"Sometimes, it's not like we're running away from these blooms,\" said Hirzel.\u00a0\n\"A lot of times, we're going right to them. It's not very pleasant to look at. It's sometimes not very pleasant to smell it, but the fish are certainly active under it.\"\nRyan Atkins helps bring a boat ashore at South Bass Island State Park, Ohio, in Lake Erie on July 29, 2015. \n \n(Eric Albrecht/The Columbus Dispatch via AP)\nHehn, from Michigan, agrees, calling it \"kind of a running joke\" in the charter industry and specifically the group he fishes with.\n\"It's almost like the walleye have sunglasses at that time of year and then a flat day with the algae bloom \u2026 the bites continue to be very good still, where if we don't have that algae bloom and it flattens out, and it's really high sun, the bite will typically slow down quite a bit.\"\nCan humans get sick from eating fish exposed to algae blooms?\nHehn said that from his experience, fish typically aren't eating algae on the surface.\u00a0\n\"Everything I've ever heard from the Michigan DNR\u00a0[Department of Natural Resources]\u00a0and then through the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission is that algae doesn't have any effect on the quality of the meat or anything like that.\"\nBut what do the scientists say?\nThe director at Ohio Sea Grant and Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory said\u00a0fish can accumulate toxins from algae blooms in their flesh.\nA fish is filleted. \n \n(Emily Rendell-Watson/CBC)\nHowever, according to Chris Winslow, academic and agency research isn't showing high enough fillet concentration levels to justify additional warnings, in fear of transferring toxins to people who eat them.\n\"There is already a fish consumption advisory in place for Lake Erie fish\u00a0and it's primarily based on mercury,\" said Winslow.\u00a0 \n\"But what we're finding is the toxins in the fish tissue are not trumping the mercury consumption advisory, so long as you're following the advisory that's been in place since the 70s \u2026 those toxins have not made it any worse.\"\nAre fish impacted by exposure to Lake Erie algae blooms?\nRen\u00e9 Shahmohamadloo has published a \nresearch paper\n on how Lake Erie fish are safe to eat despite being afflicted by algal hepatotoxins, but he's also concerned about the health of the fish.\nThe ecotoxicologist and postdoctoral scientist said\u00a0he hopes his work can advocate for a \"voiceless\" fish population.\n\"What about the fish themselves who have no choice but to swim in these potentially very toxic baths?\" said Shahmohamadloo, who's dually affiliated with Washington State University and the University of Guelph in Ontario.\u00a0\n\"I find it fascinating how we can look at this story because it shows how human centric we've become \u2026 if it's not an issue to us as a human species, let's keep life going on.\"\nA dead fish shown washed up on a beach area along Lake Erie.\n \n(U.S. National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms/Thomas Archer)\nAfter two rounds of sampling, Shahmohamadloo said\u00a0their study suggests the levels of concentrations would be of concern to fish population growth and development.\u00a0\nSome fish were harbouring unhealthy levels of microcystins \u2014 a liver toxin \u2014 before, during and after major algae bloom events, he said.\n\"It's suggestive that it could be an issue for their own growth, development and population dynamics.\"\nRen\u00e9 Shahmohamadloo, an ecotoxicologist and postdoctoral scientist, is shown holding a flask of cyanobacteria.\n \n(Ren\u00e9 Shahmohamadloo)\nShahmohamadloo\u00a0said\u00a0there's a chance fish are flocking together underneath the blooms because they're stressed out.\u00a0\n\"It's easy for us to fish them, but there could potentially be a serious biological reason that's causing the fish to congregate that way, like cyanobacteria. We need to be careful when we think about these blooms.\"\nIn contrast, Winslow said, he needs to see more \"definitive\" research to support the idea that fish are being affected by the toxins.\n\"We don't seem to see that it's killing fish and we don't even seem to think that it's affecting their behaviour or their growth to date.\"\nHow have\u00a0blooms been so far this summer on Lake Erie?\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) continues to predict a low to moderate-sized bloom across the western Lake Erie watershed this summer.\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, the U.S. federal agency expects a severity level range of 2 to 4.5 because of a dry spring and low phosphorus loads into the lake.\nForecast predicts 'moderate' sized algal bloom for western Lake Erie this summer\nAs of July 24, the current bloom in western Lake Erie has an approximate area of 620 square kilometres, with scum likely showing up nearshore around parts of Michigan and Ohio.\u00a0\nSatellite imagery showing cyanobacterial density levels across Lake Erie.\n \n(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)\nRajesh Bejankiwar said\u00a0even though they\u00a0don't\u00a0change the severity of algae blooms, wind and wave action can impact them\u00a0across the western basin of Lake Erie.\u00a0\nThe International Joint Commission scientist said\u00a0they can alter\u00a0how blooms spread, and collect at beaches and local shorelines.\n\"If you have a big amount of algae and if there is a wind from south to north, obviously the blooms will move towards the north shore of Lake Erie and then we'll see more on our shoreline, on the Ontario side,\" Bejankiwar said.\u00a0\nNOAA chart illustrating forecasted bloom severity for western Lake Erie.\n \n(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)\nSandy Bihn lives at the mouth of the Maumee River and Lake Erie \u2014 an area widely viewed as a main source of phosphorus load into the lake from livestock manure.\nShe's also the executive director for an advocacy group called Lake Erie Waterkeeper \u2014 with a focus on algal blooms.\nThe New Wave\nStopping algae blooms may start on farmlands\nBihn said\u00a0she expects the bloom to be bigger in August and September because of the recent rainfall we've seen.\n\"These blooms are caused by usually six to eight major events in a year,\" Bihn said.\n\"The waters are a little cooler this year. Water levels are down this year from what they've been a little bit. How much that factors in temperature certainly does play a role in it, but I suspect we're going to have a large bloom in August and September.\"\nLake Erie is shown from Pelee Island in the summer of 2023.\n \n(Cathy Miller)\nThe health of Lake Erie is \"immeasurably important\" to Pelee Island, according to its mayor.\nSo far, Cathy Miller said\u00a0there's nothing notable to report along Canada's southernmost shoreline.\n\"Our main industries of agriculture and tourism are both reliant on a healthy lake \u2014 as is most of mainland Ontario,\" said Miller.\n\"Tourism has been negatively impacted in years where massive blooms have impacted water quality.\"\nPelee Island Mayor Cathy Miller says, 'Tourism has been negatively impacted in years where massive blooms have impacted water quality.' \n \n(Cathy Miller)\nShe said\u00a0the island consistently tracks algae bloom reports from a handful of agencies, adding despite algal blooms affecting small communities like Pelee Island first, that it's an \"international issue that ultimately could affect us all.\"\n\"It is my perception that \nOntario's 12-point plan\n to address this issue has been effective.\"\u00a0\nEveryone who draws on Lake Erie for drinking water could be impacted by high levels of algae and algal blooms, added Miller.\n\"Residents draw from personal wells, small drinking water systems, sand points and the municipal water system. The municipal water system is heavily monitored and regulated to ensure safety.\"",

Sabia's work resulted in the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada in 1967.\n\"She had a talk show every morning, and she started having all these discussions about women, and women's rights and what we should know,\" said Hogg. \"Boy, did my attitude change.\n\"I just started speaking up for myself. I said, 'I'm not being a doormat anymore,'\" said the self-described free spirit, who has often taken off on adventures around the world.\nOne of Hogg's\u00a0three daughters, Amy, said,\u00a0\"I grew up knowing I didn't have a 'conventional'\u00a0mother. As a result, I had many adventures that none of my friends were lucky enough to experience.\n\"She led by example, and inspired me to dream big and be independent.\"\nDiagnosis changes life\nIn her 70s, Hogg learned of a group for seniors with ADHD.

This photo of her Danish grandmother hangs above the bakery. \"She would think that was funny,\" the baker said. \n \n(Garrit Sepers)\n\"They were at night and I was alone in my bed, so they went unnoticed and the symptoms of them, like anxiety and various struggles, presented as severe mental\u00a0health [problems],\" she said.\u00a0\n\"Bakers get up at obscene hours,\" she said. \"Proper sleep is really important for epilepsy. So when you're waking up at two o'clock in the morning,\u00a0you're not getting good, restful sleep,\" she said.\u00a0\nWith the bakery's flexible hours, however, \"I can provide people with what I love, but in a safe environment\u00a0with the people that I love. It's really amazing and special thing.\"\nIt's also an important connection to her past.\u00a0\n\"My grandmother is really the one who started it all for me.

It can be very stressful.\"\nFranklin\u00a0said if individuals are stressed about having a seizure at work, it can actually lead to more frequent seizures. She added that not all seizures are convulsive, and can present as daydreaming or staring off.\u00a0\nThe agency\u00a0offers training for workplaces, to help staff recognize what seizures looks like and how to keep somebody safe, as what workplaces can do to\u00a0avoid triggering them. Last year, the agency did 106 workplace presentations.\u00a0\nThis can be especially\u00a0helpful for high-traffic arenas and concert venues, she said.\u00a0\n\"If you think of one\u00a0in 100 people having epilepsy, that's a lot of people they're seeing and the potential is there,\" said Franklin.\u00a0",

        "content": "\"I couldn't imagine doing this on my own,\" says Nolan Wilde, lead singer of Brothers Wilde. For the last five years, he's been performing with his brother, guitarist Ethan Wilde, with an April show at Toronto's legendary Horseshoe Tavern.\u00a0\nThe siblings from Kettle and Stony Point First Nation, northeast of Sarnia, Ont., are performing at Revelree Music Festival in Sarnia\u00a0on Saturday. The\u00a0lineup that includes The Arkells, Lights and Glorious Sons.\u00a0\nAfternoon Drive\n's Allison Devereaux spoke with Brothers Wilde ahead of the show.\u00a0\nThe following has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nAllison Devereaux: Nolan, this story starts with you, as lead singer. When did you realize you have a gift?\nNolan Wilde: I realized it was more of a passion than a gift early on, about the age of 10 to 12, singing in the car with my aunts as we go for car rides. Just getting small comments from my family members saying, \"Oh, you have a nice voice.\"\nAD: Did you wonder at times if maybe they were just trying to be encouraging out of the goodness of their hearts?\nNW: Even today I still think, from my family, they're just being kind out of the kindness of their own heart sometimes. (laughing)\u00a0\nBut in high school (Sarnia Collegiate Institute and Technical School), that was singing in front of people who had no background on who I was. It wasn't family members, it wasn't friends. It was just to the public.\u00a0\n20 and 24-year-old Ethan and Nolan Wilde performed at Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto in April.  \n \n(Meghan Bond Photography)\nThe high school put on a performance called The Review, it was singing\u00a0\nHead Over Boots\n\u00a0by John Pardi. It was a very stripped-down song, just me and an acoustic guitar. It was really quiet and I was nervous. I was definitely shaking in my boots.\nBut as soon as the song ended and I sang the last line, just this uproar of about 300 people. I felt this sense of belonging that I'd never felt before.\nAD: Ethan, Nolan is your older brother, and you were actually in the crowd that day?\nEthan Wilde: I was in the crowd for sure. And I get what he says, that roar. There was a real roar and I wanted to be a part of that. I just looked around, at 300 people, just looking at my older brother and I'm like, \"Man, that's so cool. I want to do that\u00a0\nwith\n\u00a0him.\" And I learned how to play guitar.\u00a0\nAD: What are the stories you tell in your songs?\nNW: The most common theme in our songs is having a good time. Having a positive outlook even when things seem negative. Our song, Good Day, touches on those experiences and looking at the better things. Our songs are just about nothing but positive vibes, with a few heartbreak songs in there, of course. (laughing)\nEW: Roots was the first song we've written. We both wrote it together. It's just about paying homage to where we come from, which is Kettle & Stony Points. That's our reserve that we're from. We're not afraid to show that we're country guys, too. We're Indigenous, and we're country. That's our roots. We're putting them in the ground for people to see. It's just paying homage to who we are, where we come from, and just letting people know, as an introduction. That's why we released that as our first song.\u00a0\nAD: Ethan, would you say you have a sibling rivalry at all?\nEW: A sibling rivalry? Yeah, definitely ever since growing up. We've always been into wrestling as young kids, like WWE and we'd have no one to wrestle with so we'd wrestle with each other. Basketball. I pretty much did everything Nolan did, growing up. I would get pretty good at those things, too, so there were some rivalries. But it's all love in the music game here.\u00a0\nAD: Nolan, what do you think being brothers brings to what you're creating?\nNW: I think first and foremost it brings a sense of trust. Music is music, but at the end of the day, it is a business, too. I couldn't imagine doing this on my own or with someone who I didn't have that relationship with. We know what each other is thinking, we can read each other's vibe.\u00a0\nEthan and Nolan Wilde\n \n(Meghan Bond Photography)\nAD: You're 20 and 24 right now. What is the dream? Where are you hoping to take this?\nEW: We just want to continue doing this as long as we can. Playing shows all over the world, touring, opening for being names and possibly being that big name. We want to do it all.\u00a0\nNW: If I was to add anything, to be on a platform that helps inspire young, Indigenous youth who want to write songs, they have songs but are too afraid to get it out there. We want to be someone that people look at and say, \"Well, if they can do it, maybe I can do it, too.\"\nBrothers Wilde are performing at\u00a0\nRevelree Music Festival\n\u00a0in Sarnia on Saturday, July 22nd.\u00a0\nThey're on the\u00a0\nGrand Bend beach stage\n\u00a0on Sunday, July 23 at 7pm, supporting Celtic rock band Mudmen.",

        "summary": "London should get first dibs on any publicly funded addiction rehab centres the province builds, Mayor Josh Morgan says after Premier Doug Ford commits to building new facilities.",
        "content": "London should be the first city in Ontario to get any newly-built publicly-funded addiction rehab facilities, Mayor Josh Morgan says.\u00a0\n\"Treatment is health care, and so it's not something the city can do. This is a fully provincial responsibility and only the province can help us and our citizens and residents,\" Morgan told CBC News.\u00a0\nMorgan, Deputy Mayor Shawn Lewis and Coun. Susan Stevenson are asking for other councillors' support to advocate for a provincial addiction rehabilitation centre in London.\u00a0\n\"It would mean a great deal for those in our community who need affordable addiction treatment. We know across the province there is a lack of affordable options. There are many options available for those who have the wealth to be able to move into that space but for those who need more support, it's just not there,\" Morgan said.\u00a0\nWhy Jessica Beacham's death is being called 'emblematic of our failures as a city'\nOntario Premier Doug Ford made the pledge to move \"full steam ahead\" to build\u00a0new publicly funded addiction rehab centres during a radio interview on July 14.\u00a0\nPrivate rehab facilities are out of reach for many people, Ford said.\u00a0\n\"There's a very high demand for rehabilitation and addiction services. Once you do the assessment, there's a very long waiting process and unless people have insurance or money, those funded spots can be pretty challenging to get,\" said Sarah Campbell, who runs the Ark Aid Mission in London.\u00a0\nLack of affordable options\nLondon, like many other cities, is dealing with a mental health and addiction crisis. People living on London's streets are dying from overdoses and harm reduction services, such as giving out clean drug-use products, supervised drug consumption sites and prescribed drugs called safer supply, only go so far in reducing death, Morgan said.\u00a0\nWhat you need to know about London's proposed homeless hubs\n\"Harm reduction keeps people alive. It allows them to get to the space where they can move into treatment options,\" he said. \"But when there's a lack of affordable treatment options available, that is a significant challenge.\"\u00a0\nThere are good programs in London, such as the Salvation Army's Centre of Hope recovery centre and Mission Services' Quintin Warner House, a 20-bed treatment centre with a four-month live-in program, Campbell said. But many more are also needed, she added.\u00a0\nThere are good things happening, but we need to make sure that there is more that is accessible to all people,\" Campbell said.\u00a0\nCoupling harm reduction services with affordable treatment options for people who need and want that would be key to building a system that offers proper supports, Morgan added.\u00a0\n\"Harm reduction and treatment go hand-in-hand,\" he said.\nCan't have one without the other\nThat sentiment is echoed by Dr. Peter Selby, a clinician scientist and the senior medical consultant at Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Selby's\u00a0research focuses on innovative methods to understand and treat addictive behaviours and their associated health outcomes.\n\"In addiction to treatment, you need housing and supports and meaningful work and meaningful life to all come together,\" Selby said. \"You can't have one without the other. It just doesn't work.\"\u00a0\nHaving a fewer drugs on the street, and making sure those drugs are as safe as possible, is also important, Selby said.\u00a0\nThat's Morgan's perspective, too.\u00a0\n\"Those who believe in the harm reduction model also recognize the treatment as a key component. Those who believe in the treatment model know that harm reduction helps keep people alive from the tainted drug supply, and allows them to get to the place where they can receive the treatment that they need. These things work together. One doesn't work without the other.\"\u00a0\nPeople are suffering in London and need both harm reduction services as well as treatment options so they can eventually get housing without supports.\u00a0\n\"I see the need for harm reduction but I also see the need for people to have realistic, reasonable treatment options that they can reach and achieve to get themselves to a place in life where they can move into housing without supports, move into a place where they can go back to contributing to the community in a significant and meaningful way,\" Morgan said.\u00a0",

People packed the street left to right, with many following the parade all the way to Victoria Park.\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\nSince protests at June's Wortley Pride celebrations and Saturday's pride festival in Victoria Park, those attending the parade reacted positively to the lack of resistance on\u00a0Sunday.\nTensions high as protesters and drag queen story time supporters face off at Wortley Pride\n\"I'm feeling great, I'm feeling energized, positive vibes all around,\" said Deputy Mayor Shawn Lewis, the city's first openly gay elected official. \"After the negativity of some of the anti-LGBTQ+ hate that we've seen in the region in the last couple of months, this was a really affirming afternoon.\"\nWhile the parade was a celebration of life and culture, it was also a message, according to Lewis.\n\"I think more than ever it's important for allies to join the community and speak out and say [anti-LGBTQ hate is] not okay,\" he said. \"So this is a celebration, but it's also a show to the negativity out there.

They could be seen atop floats, or standing on slow-moving trucks while police escorted the parade forward.\nTo Miss Shaneen, a 19-year-old performer\u00a0who claims to be London's youngest drag queen, the lack of protesters at Sunday's parade was surprising, but welcome.\n\"I'm really excited just to see all these new faces and see all the new kids coming out just to celebrate who they are,\" said Miss Shaneen, who\u00a0started drag at age 13.\u00a0\n\"The energy here is amazing.\"\nWith Sunday's parade, London's pride week has come to a close.\u00a0\nHere are some more sights from the festivities:\nThe sound of music and shouts of support from paradegoers filled the streets Sunday.\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)",

He was among\u00a0the elite\u00a0livestock painters.\"\nBefore the Second War, Ross\u00a0painted\u00a0ideal depictions of 11 different breeds, \"standard types\" as they were called \u2014 four dairy cow breeds, four beef breeds\u00a0and two draft horse breeds.\u00a0He continued painting and sculpting animals for many years. The\u00a0bulk of them remain\u00a0on display\u00a0at the family farm\u00a0gallery, which once doubled as Butler's studio before he died in 1995 at age 88.\nBut thanks to waning public interest, David, who lives at the farm and has run the gallery for some 30 years, is\u00a0making plans to close it down. The art will be sold,\u00a0bequeathed and donated, he said.\n\"The collection will be dispersed.\"\nButler painted this Holstein cow in 1936.\n \n(Submitted by David Ross)\nEarly 15 minutes of fame\nRoss was born in Norwich\u00a0in\u00a0southwestern Ontario\u00a0to a farming family. He had two passions: farm life and drawing.\n\"As a young boy, he was always drawing and doodling,\" said David. \"But the farm life was always there.\"\u00a0\nRoss, who eventually became a Jersey breeder himself,\u00a0began specializing in drawing and painting farm animals. But his true talent was realized when\u00a0he began \"creating breed standards for domestic livestock in Canada,\" said David.\n \nRoss Butler's works\u00a0idealize life on the farm and this notion of a quieter and more noble way of life.\n- Mary Reid, curator, Woodstock Art Gallery\n\"He worked with different breed committees, such as Holstein Canada or Jersey Canada,\" David explained to\n London Morning\n's Rebecca Zandbergen.\u00a0\"They would develop what was thought to be the ideal specimen of what the cows should look like and he would paint that\u00a0after it was approved by the committees.\nThis Butler painting from 1975 is called All Canadian Holsteins.\n \n(Submitted by David Butler)\n\"During the 1930s, that was kind of his 15 minutes of fame,\" said David.\u00a0\"It's a specific genre and fairly niche, and often it's considered folk art.\u00a0\n\"Because of that, he was not well known in the art world,\u00a0but had a worldwide reputation in the agricultural community.\"\nFor the breed committees, Ross painted an\u00a0Aberdeen\u00a0Angus, a Hereford, a Beef Short Horn and a Dual Purpose Short Horn \u2014 all\u00a0beef breeds. He also depicted four dairy breeds: a\u00a0Holstein,\u00a0a Jersey, a Guernsey\u00a0and an\u00a0Ayrshire,\u00a0as well as\u00a0two draft horse breeds: a Percheron\u00a0and a Clydesdale.\nPrints of his paintings travelled around the world, said David.\u00a0\n\"Often when\u00a0cattle was\u00a0exported to other countries to improve their dairy herds, some of his models\u00a0or his prints would go along with the cattle.\"\nRoss also made sculptures of livestock and was the first Canadian artist to sculpt in\u00a0butter at the Canadian National Exhibition and the Royal Winter Fair in Toronto, said David.\nButler, who was born in Norwich, Ont., made his livelihood by painting. He also ran a farm for many years.\n \n(Submitted by David Butler)\nSimpler and kinder lifestyle\nAs people began feeling more isolated in big cities during the Great Depression, agricultural art\u00a0became more popular, and for good reason, said Woodstock Art Gallery curator and director Mary Reid.\n\"People turned to more rural and agricultural representation of America as holding up moral and ethical values of society,\" said Reid.\u00a0\n \nButler's paintings are a beacon of hope and a reminder of us to not forget or lose sight of what is important in life.\n- Woodstock Art Gallery curator, Mary Reid\n\"Ross Butler's works fit squarely in this genre, idealizing life on the farm, and this notion of a quieter and more noble way of life.\"\u00a0\nReid believes Butler's work has an even\u00a0greater significance today.\n\"It not only speaks to representation of agriculture from 100 years ago, but also what is being lost as the agricultural industry becomes more and more corporatized,\" she\u00a0said.\u00a0 \n\"Butler's paintings are a beacon of hope and a reminder of us to not forget or lose sight of what is important in life.\"\nAccording to David Butler, his father Ross was the first Canadian artist to sculpt in\u00a0butter at the Canadian National Exhibition and the Royal Winter Fair.\n \n(Submitted by David Butler)\nHopeful for new home\nThe Ross Butler gallery shut down during the pandemic, but has since reopened by appointment.\nIn the next two to three years, the\u00a0gallery will likely just close, said David.\u00a0\n\"We're hopeful that some of [the collection]\u00a0will end up in the Woodstock Art Gallery and the Woodstock Museum National Historic Site,\" he said.\nCollectors have also shown interest in purchasing some pieces, but that's not his preference, said David.\n\"I would rather it ended up in public institutions.\"\nDavid Butler is Ross's only child and has been showing his father's collection at the family farm for more than 30 years.\n \n(Submitted by David Butler)\n\u00a0",

        "summary": "London city councilors approved a plan to build a number of community hubs that will provide emergency shelters and service supports to the city's growing homeless population.",
        "content": "The City of London has moved a step closer to approving a\u00a0multi-million dollar plan to open a series of neighbourhood service hubs intended to provide life-saving supports and pathways to housing for those suffering through an increasingly deadly homelessness crisis.\u00a0\nThe plan was approved by a 11-4 vote in council sitting as the Strategic Priorities and Police Committee\u00a0after almost six hours of discussion held solely to debate the hub plan.\u00a0\nMonths in the making, the plan will allow the city to enter a procurement process to set up three to\u00a0five hubs before the end of the year, with the possibility of expanding to up to 15 hubs in the future.\u00a0\nThe hubs will be places where those who sleep outside\u00a0\u2014 they number about 2,000\u00a0\u2014\u00a0can get access to basic services such as food, water, a temporary bed, bathroom and shower facilities\u00a0but also begin the process of accessing supportive housing. The hubs are intended to stabilize the most acute cases so they can be safe while they're assessed and connected with the services they need.\nThe report says the need for expanded services is urgent as more than 200 people who have a history of accessing services\u00a0in London have died since 2020.\nCouncillors on Monday debated the plan, raising questions about its cost, which a city report says will include an annual operating cost of $2.7 million per hub, along with an estimated $2 million capital startup costs. City manager Lynne Livingstone said the city will need help from senior governments to help fund the plan. A fund of $25 million donated by a family that wishes to remain anonymous will also help cover the costs.\u00a0\nWhere will they be located?\nThere were also questions about where the hubs will be located, but their locations won't be known until the city receives requests for proposals from the agencies expected to bid on contracts to operate the hubs. In response to councillors' questions, staff said each hub will be housed in a building\u00a0between 8,000 to 10,000 square feet in size, near an arterial road, not close to schools or parks and on land zoned for emergency care establishments.\u00a0\nCoun. Susan Stevenson, who's been a regular critic of the city's plan, questioned whether the hubs will have enough capacity to create a significant improvement. She also pointed out that the staff\u00a0report outlining the plan only became public last week, and argued it didn't give enough time for people to understand the plan.\n\"There is not time to really digest something that is so important to them,\" said Stevenson. \"We're talking about bringing these hubs into their communities and they care passionately about this crisis that we face.\"\u00a0\nIn response to Stevenson's concerns, councillors pointed to the city's engagement efforts on the broad strokes of the plan, including multiple community engagement sessions\u00a0and 1,500 responses to the city through various forms of feedback.\u00a0\nMayor Josh Morgan said he expects the plan will need some adjustment as the hubs get up and running. He also pointed out that it was designed by a group of stakeholders that included everyone from medical professionals, to business leaders and people who provide frontline care for people who are homeless.\u00a0\n\"The City of London played an important role in this system but it is not the City of London's system,\" Morgan said. \"This belongs to the community, it was designed by the community.\"\u00a0 \nCoun. Paul Van Meerbergen put forward a motion to hold a special committee meeting to discuss the plan and include a public participation meeting before it moves ahead.\u00a0\nThat motion was defeated by a 4 to 11 vote (Van Meerbergen, Stevenson, Cuddy, Hillier in favour).\u00a0 \nCoun. Sam Trosow\u00a0said pushing the decision back to another public meeting\u00a0would only delay the hubs getting up and running.\u00a0\n\"Rhetorically I would ask 'How many people are going to die between now and then?'\" he said. \"This is a matter of very serious urgency and I don't think much is going to be added at another public meeting.\"\u00a0\nThe hub plan will face a vote for final approval at Tuesday's council meeting.",

Who's going to fix it?\u00a0There's a million questions that we have to answer.\"\nLTC General Manager Kelly Paleczny, London Mayor Josh Morgan, London North Centre MP Peter Fragiskatos, President and CEO of CUTRIC Josipa Petrunic, and London West MP Arielle Kayabaga. \n \n(Mike Lacasse/CBC London)\nTo offset costs, the London Transit is joining with Burlington Transit in a coalition to invest in electric batteries,\u00a0electric buses, charges ports and accompanying infrastructure, said Josipa Petrunic, president and CEO of CUTRIC.\n\"It's so complicated that the only way to do it is you partner these agencies together. You do these bulk buys and you get a bunch of funding bodies with a really innovative city council backing it up,\" Petrunic said.\nElectric buses long way away\nBurlington and London are the first two members of the\u00a0Canadian Urban Transit Zero Emission Bus Joint Procurement Initiative. It's a group that will help cities bulk-buy what's needed to transition to zero emission busses while\u00a0keeping costs down.\u00a0\n\"The work we're going to do is not just getting the first bus out the door, it's getting the next 10 buses out the door,\" Petrunic said.\nThe project is receiving funding\u00a0from\u00a0the Government of Canada's \nZero Emission Transit Fund\n, of which CUTRIC is the designated national planning service.\nLondon Transit has said it wants to add 10 battery-powered buses to its fleet, but the move would come with a $25 million price tag and years of waiting. The facility to charge and maintain the electric fleet would cost more than $330 million.\u00a0",

The counties outside of London are full of hidden gems, so we're asking the people who know their county best to give their top three list of must-dos.\u00a0\nRick Sickinger\u00a0is an economic development officer in Huron County, specializing in tourism and food. He joined \nCBC London Morning\n to talk about\u00a0the county north of London, Ont., known as 'Ontario's West Coast.'\nHere are his\u00a0top three picks for a\u00a0Huron\u00a0County road trip.\n1. A day at the beach\n\"It's time for a day at the beach and Huron County has 100 kilometres of Lake Huron shoreline and 15 public beaches for you to enjoy,\" said Sickinger. \"I'd start with Goderich, and it's\u00a0because Goderich has three beaches for the price of one.\"\nThere's the Main Beach,\u00a0St.\u00a0Christopher's Beach, which is dog-friendly, and Rotary Cove, which has playgrounds for children. There's a boardwalk that spans the entire shoreline and features washrooms and\u00a0places to\u00a0eat. There are fees for parking.\nBuilt in 1907, the Canadian Pacific Railway Station in the Goderich Harbour is now home to the Beach Street Station restaurant.\n \n(Travis Dolynny/CBC)\n\"Goderich also has something they call the double sunset,\" said Sickinger. \"If you are watching the sunset from Rotary Cove, you can watch the sun go down the horizon. Then you can quickly run up the stairs to the bluff where the lighthouse is,\u00a0and you can watch it again.\"\n2. The Vine and Ale\u00a0Trail\nAfter a day at the beach, what says Canadian summer like drinks on a patio with friends?\n\"So Huron County's got you covered there. Our Vine and Ale Trail is a trail of our six wineries, six breweries and one cidery,\" said Sickinger. \"Most of the wineries and breweries have live musical entertainment and parings with local food during the summer months.\"\nRick Sickinger is the economic development officer for tourism in Huron County.\n \n(Rebecca Zandbergen/CBC)\nThe Wine and Vine Trail\n features wineries and breweries that span from Grand Bend, through Bayfield and north to Goderich, along with stops in Blyth and Vanastra. It's not a hiking a trail, so visitors will have to plan for a designated driver.\n3. Get outside and play\nHuron County has 36 free public trails in the region, including the Goderich to Guelph Rail Trail\u00a0known as the \nG2G Rail Trail\n, which runs 132 kilometres along a former rail line.\nA former rail bridge is part of the G2G Rail Trail near the Goderich trailhead.\n \n(Travis Dolynny/CBC)\n\"It is very flat in most of the area and nicely surfaced, so it's a fully accessible trail,\" said Sickinger. \"It started with hikers and walkers, but has exploded since 2020 with cyclists. So it's a multi-use trail that's very popular and gets you off the busy roads.\"\nThe largest G2G trailheads in the county are in Walton, Blyth, Auburn and Goderich.\nLISTEN | So many things to see and do in Huron County:\nLondon Morning\n7:10\nLooking to leave the city this summer for a quick get-away?

He's also behind on his $2,200\u00a0monthly rent, and he can't\u00a0find work that will\u00a0accommodate his disability and help support his family.\n\"I just personally don't understand how I'm expected to live,\" Kitchen, 37, said, adding he's worried that the \"snowball effect\"\u00a0from putting off\u00a0bills will eventually make\u00a0himself and his family homeless.\n\"It's really crazy what we're going through, and ... I don't think the public has any idea.\"\nKitchen said\u00a0despite public perception of social assistance\u00a0being enough to make do,\u00a0the financial support he receives from all levels of government \u2014 including a hydro rebate and the Canada Child Benefit, in addition to his disability payment\u00a0\u2014 isn't nearly enough to contend with soaring\u00a0rents, let alone the rising cost of living.\nAs rents run rampant, doubling ODSP and Ontario Works 'the only decent thing to do,' says advocate\nConcerns, confusion mount over Manitoba's new disability income support program\nKitchen isn't alone.\u00a0According to the most recent federal data, about\u00a0\none in five people in Canada aged 15 years and over\n\u00a0\nhave at least one\u00a0disability, with almost 17 per cent of all people living with a disability experiencing poverty. To make matters worse,\u00a0people with disabilities account\u00a0for \n30 per cent of Canadians living in deep poverty\n, earning below\u00a075 per cent\u00a0of Canada's official poverty line.\nExperts say governments are not only providing an inadequate amount\u00a0of affordable and accessible housing units for people with disabilities, but they're failing their broader duties of ensuring sufficient\u00a0support\u00a0in\u00a0the community.\n\"People are receiving rates that are at least a decade behind, if not more,\" said\u00a0Rabia Khedr, national director of advocacy group Disability Without Poverty.\nWATCH | Advocates call on government to double Ontario's disability support rates: \nDisability advocates are calling for the Ontario Disability Support Program social assistance rates to double\n10 months ago\nDuration \n8:30\nMitchell Tremblay is an ODSP recipient and advocate, he joins us to discuss how the rising cost of living is most affecting those who rely on social assistance.\nAcross Canada, people on some form of disability benefit\u00a0generally receive\u00a0about 40 per cent of the \nofficial poverty line calculated for\u00a0the community\n\u00a0in which they live, Khedr said.\u00a0The lack of annual increases to supports, in line with inflation, and the rise in the cost of living have\u00a0essentially kept people with disabilities in \"a cycle\" of poverty that makes it hard to get ahead, she said.\nAnd while the federal Liberal government has passed legislation for a new \nCanada-wide disability benefit\n, it still remains to be seen how much people will receive \u2014 and whether it will even come into force if another party forms the government, Khedr said.\n\"If you don't have the money, you can't have appropriate shelter, you can't have clothing, you can't have food to be productive and be able to keep a job,\" she said. \"You're constantly in this struggle. It's just keeping you down.\"\nCritics call for boost in assistance\nDouglas Kwan, director of advocacy and legal services at\u00a0the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario, said\u00a0people with disabilities accounted for about 60 per cent of the roughly\u00a010,000 tenants the centre served last year. Many of them went to the province's Landlord and Tenant Board facing eviction due to not being able to afford rent, he said.\nAnd that's only\u00a0the case for people with disabilities who were able to find\u00a0housing to\u00a0begin with, he said.\nPeople with disabilities accounted for about 60 per cent of the roughly 10,000 tenants served by the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario last year, a representative says.\n \n(David Horemans/CBC)\n\"Especially in a tight housing market and in the midst of an affordable housing crisis, property owners simply won't rent out to people with fixed incomes or with disability,\" Kwan said, adding this is considered discrimination\u00a0under Canadian law.\nTo alleviate the problem, his said, governments need to commit to boosting social assistance rates across the board, fund and build more\u00a0transitional, affordable and accessible housing units, and implement rent and vacancy controls.\nBut Tim Aubry, a co-chair of the Canadian Housing First Network, which helps communities across Canada implement programs aimed at housing people experiencing homelessness, said\u00a0disability supports,\u00a0such as income supplements, are only part of the solution.\nLISTEN |\u00a0When housing is affordable but not accessible: \nAll Points West\n9:46\nWhen housing is affordable but not accessible\nVictoria's Dalmation building is part of a growing strategy to reduce the costs of new rental housing by reducing or eliminating tenant parking. But for tenants who live with a disability, like Aeryn Donald, it's been a big challenge. Aeryn shared their story with Jason D'Souza.\nThe rest lies in ensuring that people with disabilities can access additional services, ranging from mental health to assistance entering the workforce.\n\"One of the biggest feeders of homelessness, without a doubt, is the level of poverty that people with disabilities are living,\" said Aubry, a psychology professor at the University of Ottawa.\n\"Homelessness, it's really a reflection of the failure of our social policies.\"\nGovernments need to be held to account: lawyer\nThe federal government \nannounced a 10-year plan in 2017\n aimed at \"taking steps toward advancing the right to housing,\" and in 2019, it officially encoded \nhousing as a human right in Canadian law\n.\nDespite this, Kwan said,\u00a0it's not a right that's enforceable through law,\u00a0but instead is used as a\u00a0\"way and an approach\" to design housing programs.\nBut Vince Calderhead, a lawyer with Pink Larkin in Halifax who specializes in law reform for low-income Canadians, said\u00a0people with disabilities should still consider holding governments legally accountable for the gap between \"what they've promised internationally to do\"\u00a0and \"what they're actually doing.\"\nNew benefit increase in B.C. will not provide money to all who need it: critics\nPeople with disabilities need more federal supports to deter requests for assisted dying, committee says\nHe said governments in Canada, both provincial and federal, are failing their obligations under both domestic and global covenants \u2014 such as\u00a0the right to equality under the \nCharter of Rights and Freedoms\n\u00a0and \nUnited Nations\u00a0declarations\n\u00a0\u2014\u00a0pointing toward\u00a0inadequate disability support programs\u00a0and government \nfailure in\u00a0making\u00a0them easy to access\n where people with disabilities live.\n\"Too often those obligations aren't being respected when it comes to persons with disabilities, and governments have felt that they could get away with it because, essentially, we live in a largely ableist society,\" Calderhead said.\n\"It's time to hold governments to account.\"\nManitobans on disability now get $25 more a month, but as costs soar, some priced out of basic needs\nHe pointed to a \n2021 ruling by the\u00a0Nova Scotia Court of Appeal\n, a case\u00a0he helped litigate, that found the province was systemically discriminating against people with disabilities. Last month, \nan independent human rights board made a decision\n outlining a five-year resolution process.\n\"Advocates and people with disabilities are beginning to hold government accountable, and ... those efforts have to be redoubled,\" Calderhead said.",

That's why it's pushing the temperatures in the humidex up, and that's what we're seeing right now for the next three days,\"\u00a0said Gerald Cheng, a meteorologist with Environment Canada.\nOn Wednesday, temperatures are expected to reach 30 degrees Celsius, with a humidex value near 37.\n\"There will also be some thunderstorms, especially on Wednesday, and\u00a0they could be severe,\" Cheng said. \"Keep your eyes on the sky, and if you are traveling toward\u00a0the Windsor area, there's certainly a tornado risk on Wednesday as well.\"\nOn Thursday, temperatures are expected to dip slightly, but still, high humidity will mean humidex values in the upper 30s.\nFriday could be one of the hottest days of the summer in terms of humidex values, according to Cheng. Humidex will reach 40 for many areas.\nThroughout the duration of the heat warning, overnight lows in the low 20s will provide little relief until Saturday, when the warning ends, Cheng said.\nStaying cool is staying safe\n\"Certainly drink plenty of water even before you get\u00a0thirsty and stay in a cool place. During this time, those who are particularly vulnerable or their family, friends and neighbours\u00a0can\u00a0make sure they're cool and they're drinking water,\" said Cheng.\n\"A lot of people have air conditioning, but for those who don't, certainly this these three days will be particularly bad.\"\nOther safety tips from Environment Canada include making sure you don't leave children and pets in parked vehicles, and ensuring outdoor workers take breaks in a cool place.\nIt's also important to be aware of symptoms of heat illness\u00a0like\u00a0swelling, rash, cramps, fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and the worsening of some health conditions.\nThe City of London website says\u00a0any city-owned\u00a0community centre can be used as a cooling centre, when open, if Londoners need a reprieve from the heat.\nAreas near the lakes can expect to remain cooler than areas inland, according to Environment Canada.",

Surgeries to treat the cancer damaged her uterus and any chance of a pregnancy could be life-threatening for Smith\u00a0and the fetus.\u00a0\nProcedures to correct the damage went unsuccessful, leading Smith and her husband to look for a gestational surrogate to carry\u00a0their baby.\n\"It was devastating because I always wanted to be a mom,\" she\u00a0said. \"I\u00a0would've done anything to carry my own baby but when I found out I had no choice, I had to embark on this journey.\"\nThe search connected her to Ariel Taylor, a London, Ont., fertility therapist, who has been a five-time surrogate herself. Taylor has long documented her surrogacy journey to her nearly 80,000 followers on Instagram to educate others about the process and debunk myths around it.\nTaylor became a surrogate for Smith's family after the two women realized how much they had in common and developed a close friendship. The two have been making videos about how the process is experienced by both a surrogate and an intended parent.\u00a0\n\"We're really trying to\u00a0show people what surrogacy can be like and how it can be collaborative and a positive experience to help people with infertility get their babies here,\" said Taylor.\u00a0\n'Closest I could get to being pregnant myself'\u00a0\nSmith is pictured holding her newborn son with Taylor by her side. \n \n(Submitted by Ariel Taylor)\nThree weeks ago, Taylor gave birth to the couple's baby boy, and Smith said she's been involved every step of the way from appointments, to prenatal care\u00a0and witnessing\u00a0her son's birth.\u00a0\n\"It was the closest\u00a0I could get to being pregnant myself,\" Smith said. \"It was very important for me to have this experience since I wasn't carrying on my own. It's a very big loss and I grieved a lot, I still do because\u00a0there's a huge part of it that was missing for myself.\"\u00a0\nIn 2021, Taylor\u00a0started her practice, Carried with Love, to provide virtual therapy\u00a0and support to pregnant patients, intended parents, surrogates, mom's struggling with postpartum depression, and those who experience pregnancy loss.\u00a0\nNew postpartum support program to launch in Oxford and Elgin Counties this fall\nFirst Person\nInfertility can make you feel alone. But I can tell you you're in good company\nShe was motivated after\u00a0her first pregnancy as a surrogate\u00a0ended in a miscarriage. Taylor felt there was very little accessible counselling for people dealing with infertility and loss.\u00a0\n\"I didn't have that support so it was really important for me to create that space for other people and it's really\u00a0about reaching this population that typically goes unserviced,\" she said.\u00a0\nIn Canada, one in six couples experience \ninfertility\n. That number has doubled since the 1980s.\u00a0\n\"If you want to have a child and grow your family, then infertility shouldn't be the reason you can't do that. We have the technology and people willing to collaborate with these parents\u00a0to bring their baby here,\" Taylor added.\u00a0 \nDebunking\u00a0myths\nTaylor believes infertility rates will continue to rise\u00a0and more people will use non-traditional methods\u00a0to grow their families,\u00a0which is why it's important to address misconceptions about surrogacy, that\u00a0mainly come from a lack of education, she said.\u00a0\nCommon fallacies Taylor encounters stereotype surrogates as\u00a0poor and easily exploitable people getting paid thousands to carry a baby. Others infer that a surrogate is the baby's biological mother or that they're selling a baby, all of which are false notions, Taylor said, adding that surrogates only get reimbursed around $25,00 to $35,000 in medical, travel, and grocery expenses incurred during the pregnancy.\u00a0\nSmith said sharing their journey has opened up space for other parents to not feel alone. The experience has taught her that surrogacy doesn't need to be a taboo or shameful process.\n\"It was really scary when a doctor told me I'd need surrogacy. I thought\u00a0'How is somebody else gong to carry my baby?' but if I looked at other intended parents who were documenting, I\u00a0would've felt better,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"Knowing that all these people worked together to bring this baby here is really special,\" said Taylor. \"It just might not be the traditional way but it doesn't make it wrong.\"",

        "content": "The much-loved Thames Park Pool has likely seen its last swimmer after London city council voted Tuesday in favour of decommissioning the damaged pool instead of going ahead with repairs that could allow it to operate a few more seasons.\u00a0 \nCommunity rallies to save Thames Park Pool in Old South\nCouncil voted 8-7 in favour of a motion instructing staff to permanently close the city's largest and most-used outdoor pool. The motion also instructs staff to begin looking at new amenities for Thames Park and look into the feasibility of adding a spray pad to Thames Park or the Green in Wortley Village in consultation with the community.\u00a0\nThe motion also calls on staff to look into the logistics of building a new indoor pool in the neighbourhood, possibly at Rowntree\u00a0Park, Murray Park or at another city-owned property.\u00a0\nA staff report released in the spring recommended\u00a0against rebuilding the pool, arguing its\u00a0location on a flood plain and the site's high water table means any pool build there will be prone to water damage and closures. A crack in the pool deck prevented it from opening in the spring of 2022 and it has\u00a0been closed since.\u00a0\nCouncil was considering two options to carry out repairs costing either $1.9 million or $2.3 million\u00a0that would allow the pool to remain open a few more seasons while a new pool site is found.\u00a0\nDecommission Thames Pool, redirect funds to possible new amenities, politicians say\nBoth would not see the pool open until the 2025 season at the earliest.\nAhead of Tuesday's council meeting, members of the Old South Community Organization (OSCO) wrote a motion\u00a0to have council approve those repairs using private funds from an unspecified source.\u00a0\nA slim majority of councillors, however, opted to pull the plug on Thames Park Pool and direct staff to instead\u00a0focus on finding a new site. The money that would have been spent on repairs will now go into improvments at Thames Park and a feasibility study for the pool's replacement site.\u00a0\nCommunity left with no clear pool plan\nThe decision disappointed OSCO president Nicole Phillips. She's worried the neighbourhood will have to wait years for a new pool instead of having a place to swim while planning for the new site happens.\n\"The city has a long history of closing infrastructure and then not building new infrastructure for decades, if ever,\" she said. \"With the decommissioning of this pool there is currently no new location identified for the pool. The motion has no timelines. It's the ambiguity of that that causes alarm within the community.\"\u00a0\nOld South Community Association President Nicole Phillips said council's decision to decommission Thames Park Pool leaves the community without a needed aquatics facility with no plan or timeline to replace it.\n \n(Andrew Lupton/CBC)\nCoun. Skylar Franke, whose ward includes Old South, asked councillors to support the motion to\u00a0repair the pool\u00a0 so it could keep operating a few more season while a replacement plan takes shape.\u00a0\nHowever Deputy Mayor Shawn Lewis said it made more sense to divert money and staff time to a new aquatics facility for the neighbourhood.\u00a0\n\"I think we have to come to the realization time that it's time that we say goodbye to Thames Park Pool,\" said Lewis. \"Let's invest in the community in a responsible way .... and let's start the ball rolling on a new location.\"\nThames Park Pool was built in 1927 and at 25,000 annual visitors, had the heaviest usage of the city's 11 outdoor pools.\nOld South not ready to throw in the towel on Thames Park Pool",

        "summary": "For many, the debate over the a short stretch of the Queen Elizabeth Driveway has served as a bellwether for how local politicians and leaders view active transportation \u2014 and approach broader questions about how and for whom the city is designed.",
        "content": "The temporary closure of about\u00a0two-kilometres\u00a0of road\u00a0to motor vehicles has sparked a debate that highlights a clear divide among local leaders\u00a0on\u00a0the city's approach to active transportation.\nIn a CFRA radio interview last Tuesday, Mayor Mark Sutcliffe said he believes\u00a0the Queen Elizabeth Driveway (QED)\u00a0active transportation program should be scaled back.\nCoun. Jeff Leiper responded publicly\u00a0in a post on the Kitchissippi Ward Facebook page calling the mayor's stance \"regressive\" and his approach to advocating on the issue \"inappropriate.\"\nTwo days later, Sutcliffe elaborated on his view\u00a0in an open letter published in the Ottawa Citizen\n.\nClosing the driveway to motor vehicles \"inconveniences more residents than it benefits,\" he wrote.\nNCC releases its parkway plan to mixed reviews\n'A wonderful surprise': Ottawans flock to closed-off Queen Elizabeth Driveway\nTobi Nussbaum, CEO of the National Capital Commission (NCC), which manages Ottawa's parkways, responded days later in another letter in the newspaper.\nNussbaum defended the closure, citing the City of Ottawa's official plan, which \ncalls on the NCC\n to \"reimagine Queen Elizabeth Driveway and Colonel By Drive to reduce the roads' importance as a commuter route in favour of pedestrian activity.\"\nFor many, the debate over the short stretch of road\u00a0has served as a bellwether for how local politicians and leaders view active transportation \u2014 and\u00a0approach\u00a0broader questions about how and for whom the city is designed.\nThe active use program\nThe NCC is reserving both lanes of the QED between Fifth Avenue and Somerset Street for active use\u00a0from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day from July 1 to Sept. 4.\nThe same stretch had been closed to vehicles on weekends\u00a0and holiday Mondays from mid-May to the end of June.\nProgram\u00a0hours will be\u00a0reduced back\u00a0to weekends and holiday Mondays from Sept. 9 to Oct. 9.\nThe NCC first closed the Queen Elizabeth Driveway to motor vehicles during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. NCC CEO Tobi Nussbaum said nearly all survey respondents support continuing the program.\n \n(Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)\nActive use hours may be interrupted, the NCC said, during \"certain major events, such as the Escapade Music Festival and Ottawa Redblacks games.\"\nThe NCC originally began reserving a portion of the QED for pedestrians and cyclists\u00a0during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, responding to calls for more public space for people to exercise while remaining physically distanced.\nThe popularity of the program, Nussbaum said, inspired the NCC to expand it.\nIn its 2021-2022 annual report, the NCC\u00a0noted\u00a0\n95 per cent of survey participants\n supported continuing the program.\nTraffic, transit and emergency services\nIn a Wednesday interview on CBC's\u00a0\nOttawa Morning\n, Sutcliffe outlined his main arguments for curtailing the active use program on the QED.\nA closure of the road\u00a0between Pretoria and Fifth avenues, Sutcliffe said, creates \"traffic pressure\" for residents in the Glebe, limits accessibility to Lansdowne Park during major events and creates barriers for\u00a0emergency vehicles attempting to service the area.\nSutcliffe recognized that limiting the active use program may push more cyclists and pedestrians onto the comparatively-crowded path along the canal but, in his view, that outcome must be weighed against the benefits.\nOttawa aims to close cycling 'missing links' in new transportation plan\nSpeed limit lowering to 40 km/h on Queen Elizabeth Driveway and Colonel By Drive\n\"If our emergency vehicles are not getting to their destination in a timely fashion, if congestion is building up on residential roads that were not intended to be commuter routes, then that might be the greater issue than the pathway is getting a little bit full,\" he said.\nAlso speaking on CBC's \nOttawa Morning\n Wednesday, Leiper said he understands where Sutcliffe is coming from on the issue\u00a0but\u00a0still has a \"disagreement of opinion.\"\n\"I feel that we need to make much more space available for active transportation for pedestrians and for cyclists than we do,\" he said. \"Attempts to claw back the space that we have gotten are regressive.\"\nOttawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe says closing the stretch of the Queen Elizabeth Driveway between Pretoria and Fifth avenues causes more inconveniences than benefits for nearby residents.\n \n(Giacomo Panico/CBC)\nA recent City of Ottawa staff report notes an uptick in traffic on surrounding residential streets during periods where the QED is closed to motor vehicles.\nThe report also\u00a0\ndescribed instances in July 2022\n where Ottawa Fire Services faced delays responding to emergencies due to \"an inability to move barricades overnight.\"\nThe NCC addressed that\u00a0problem this year by restoring motor vehicle access at 8 p.m.\nThe report\u00a0found the QED closure \"introduced approximately 10-40\" pedestrians and cyclists per hour, compared to when the road was open to motor vehicles.\n\"Results show that most pedestrians and cyclists remain comfortable using the multi-use pathway,\" the report said.\nOn the basis of that report, the city's director of traffic services, Phil Landry, said in an email that the active use program affected nearby traffic, transit and emergency services.\n\"The City recommended the NCC study alternative options for its active transportation efforts and will continue to work with them to mitigate any ongoing traffic impacts from the closure of the Queen Elizabeth Driveway,\" he wrote.\nFor its part, Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group\u00a0\nhas previously opposed\n the closure of QED, citing concerns about access to Lansdowne Park.\nOttawa Morning\n14:02\nSince the spring the NCC has closed the Queen Elizabeth Driveway to cars during the day in favour of active transportation but not everyone is giving the idea a green light.\nWe hear from Mayor Mark Sutcliffe about why he thinks the N-C-C should pump the brakes on the plan.\nProgram appreciated, could use 'fine-tuning': community association\nJune Creelman, vice-president of the Glebe Community Association, said she has witnessed the displaced traffic first-hand.\nOn the occasional day of bad traffic, she said, drivers who are diverted off the parkway and onto residential streets may become confused or frustrated and make rash decisions behind the wheel.\nBut like many in the area, she said, her view on the active use program isn't black and white.\n\"I actually go up there almost every day,\" she said. \"I often bike downtown, so I think it is a value, and I see quite a few people out there and enjoying it.\"\nThe \nNCC reported 126,200 active use visits\n were made to the QED in 2022.\nCreelman said she supports active transportation on the\u00a0QED, but added she believes the program could use some \"fine-tuning or rethinking\" to manage traffic and\u00a0ensure it works better for everyone.\nWhat is the purpose of the parkways?\nNCC parkways were never intended as commuter corridors, wrote Nussbaum in his open letter in the Citizen.\nInstead, he wrote, public organizations must \"think creatively, differently, and meaningfully\" about how to reduce the city's carbon footprint.\nNussbaum, photographed after a board meeting in 2019, says the NCC is responding to a call from the city's official plan.\n \n(Jean Delisle/CBC)\nSome grassroots organizations\u00a0have taken on that thinking for themselves.\nParkways for People, a group that advocates for a new approach to managing the city's parkways, has floated ideas in the past, including \na vision of the QED\n between Pretoria and Fifth avenues as a natural urban park.\nThe group previously told CBC it would like to see the NCC's active use program extended all the way to Preston Street next year.\nDave Robertson, vice-president of cycling advocacy group Bike Ottawa, said the city has some pathways for cyclists but few quality active transportation links.\nHe said pathways along the canal that are an alternative to the QED for pedestrians and cyclists are narrow and overcrowded.\n\"They're very old. We need more space to move more people,\" he said. \"That's what the city's plan is, is to make that shift away from cars to active transportation.\"\nRobertson said Bike Ottawa would like to see the QED \"turned over to people\" \u2014 and closed to motor vehicles \u2014 on a permanent basis.\nHe said arguments about emergency vehicle access\u00a0and local traffic effects are \"fallacies.\" For example,\u00a0he said, many active transportation pathways in other cities can easily accommodate emergency responders.\n\"What the mayor is talking about just doesn't jive with the declared climate emergency,\" he said.",

        "content": "With frustration among transit riders mounting and no word on when\u00a0LRT service will resume, experts in communication and crisis management say\u00a0OC Transpo needs to apologize and offer free fares.\nThe entire light rail\u00a0line has been shuttered since Monday, as experts try to decipher why a bearing on a train became loose and whether any other cars are afflicted.\nA replacement bus service immediately hit the streets but had to be adjusted \ntime\n and \nagain\n to provide reliable service.\nNo word on LRT resumption expected until at least Monday\nCould Bluesfest crowds have broken the LRT?\n\"I get it. They're trying to improve the route and they're trying to maximize the buses. But this is the sort of stuff you should implement before everything goes to hell,\" said Justin Kelly, who runs an Ottawa transit website.\nKelly's\u00a0tongue-in-cheek site,\u00a0\nOccasional Transport\n, gives riders updates and lets them blow off steam amid the frequent disruptions that have plagued the service since its\u00a0launch.\n\"You'd think these lessons would've been learned. But we know previously there's been a culture of we do what we want and you live with it, right?\"\nOttawa software developer Justin Kelly hopes the city will explore offering a fare rebate to LRT users.                       \n \n(Hallie Cotnam/CBC)\nOnly 'missteps' so far\nRenu Bakshi, an international crisis manager and leadership coach based in Vancouver, said the city should be following the same\u00a0advice NASA follows: When everything is going right, tell the media everything. When everything is going wrong, tell the media even more.\n\"From what I've gathered looking into this situation so far, I have only seen missteps. I have not felt any empathy,\" she said.\u00a0\"I've certainly not heard any action plan, and there has been no apology.\"\nRenu Bakshi, a crisis manager and a media trainer based in Vancouver, says the City of Ottawa could have done more to reassure the public in the first days after the shutdown.\n \n(Submitted by Renu Bakshi)\nThe city gave an\u00a0hour-long media conference on Tuesday, with officials and experts from the city and the maker and maintainers of the line, Rideau Transit Group and Rideau Transit Maintenance.\nSince then, the city has opted to provide memos and some individual media interviews\u00a0\u2014 a move it says allows experts to focus on solutions to the problem.\nTo Bakshi, that's the bare minimum. She also wants more action\u00a0from Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe, who has been in New York since before the issue was discovered taking part in\u00a0the first stages of the\u00a0Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative.\u00a0\n\"Which I find ironic,\" she said.\u00a0\"If he's at a\u00a0leadership conference, he should have known that this is his time. It's time to step up into that leadership role.\"\nMayor working from New York\nSutcliffe said he's been fully engaged on this\u00a0issue from New York. He said he's been\u00a0\"in constant contact with city councillors, with city staff\" and with his office\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a work ethic which earned him praise\u00a0from\u00a0\nOntario Premier Doug Ford\n.\nSutcliffe\u00a0tweeted about an hour after the shutdown began on Monday that the situation is \"frustrating\" and that \"with every issue that is identified and fixed by our contractors, we will be one step closer to providing residents with the light rail service they paid for and deserve.\"\nOttawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe has been in New York with the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative this week, but he says there's nothing he would have done in Ottawa that he hasn't been able to do there. \n \n(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\nBakshi called the initial response \"very weak\" and lacking accountability. She said the correct response would have been to immediately\u00a0call a remote press conference so that he could speak directly with the public and explain what he will do to \"make this right.\"\nKathryn LeBlanc, the principal consultant at\u00a0LeBlanc (& co.) Communications, likewise said she would have advised the mayor to be \"a trusted face\" on the ground, which can \"go a long way in reassuring the public.\"\nSutcliffe denied any suggestion that his trip affected his work.\n\"I'm doing as much here as I could be doing in Ottawa,\" he said. \"If at any time there's a reason why I need to be back in Ottawa, and it would be better to be back in Ottawa, then I'd be there.\"\nRocky history increases need for leadership\nThe LRT has been the subject of \nTransportation Safety Board investigations\n and a public inquiry. Both called for long-term solutions.\nThey also brought forward calls for accountability.\n\"We're in a\u00a0really unique situation with the LRT, because we've had years of this billion dollar boondoggle breaking from time to time. There's been a lot of public trust that's eroded,\" LeBlanc said.\n\"There's been a culture of secrecy over the years, particularly under the last mayor at city hall.\"\nKathryn LeBlanc, principal consultant at LeBlanc (& co.) Communications, says renewing public trust in the LRT will require the City of Ottawa to provide more frequent and fulsome updates.\n \n(Submitted by Kathryn LeBlanc)\nLeBlanc agreed\u00a0that it's important to boost communication during a crisis and meet\u00a0the public where they are on social media, radio, television and online.\nA strong example of that sort of response occurred\u00a0during the pandemic, LeBlanc said, when public health experts provided consistent daily updates whether there was substantive\u00a0new information or not.\n\"While politicians are not engineers and they're not making the calls on what's safe and what's not, there's a certain responsibility when it comes to clarity,\" LeBlanc said.\nExperts recommend fare refunds\nKelly, LeBlanc and Bakshi all agreed on more piece of advice.\n\"If I was guiding the city,\" Bakshi said, \"I would say, 'Right now, make an announcement that you will reimburse those people who are holding monthly passes. You will reimburse them for every day that this train is down.\"\nFare-free travel is\u00a0something that \ncity councillors have voted to provide in the past\n, but general manager of transit services\u00a0Ren\u00e9e Amilcar has said the city is not looking at the option at this time.\nTransit riders, drivers frustrated by LRT replacement bus service\nUnreliable LRT keeps undermining public confidence in system, observers say\nLeBlanc\u00a0encouraged leaders to consider the idea\u00a0as a human response\u00a0to the struggles of\u00a0a mom who may be commuting\u00a0to work and picking kids up at daycare\u00a0or a\u00a0minimum-wage worker who may be worried their boss won't understand why they're late.\n\"As someone who relies on public transit, I'd say I feel a lot of empathy for the public and everyone else in this situation,\" she said.\u00a0\"City hall should too.\"",

        "summary": "A look at some of the most ambitious developments on the table that could change the city's skyline and suburbs.",
        "content": "More than a dozen multi-tower skyscraper\u00a0projects are on the drawing board for Ottawa, and together they could change the city's skyline from one end to the other.\nThe plans could bring towers of 30 and even 40 storeys to Kanata and Orl\u00e9ans, and line\u00a0O-Train routes with dense neighbourhoods packed with thousands of housing units.\nThat's if they go ahead in a tough\u00a0financial environment. Just last year, Claridge cancelled a 30-storey tower project, citing \nhigher interest rates\n. It had already scaled the project back from 39 storeys.\nA look at Ottawa's tallest existing building, Claridge's Icon, as well as three projects already approved, though it's unclear when, if at all, developers plan to begin serious work on the Sky and the Trinity Centre projects.\n \n(CBC News Graphics)\nThere's still no sign of construction on\u00a0Richcraft's\u00a0the Sky project on the edge of Little Italy. \nThat was approved eight years ago\n, with skyscrapers expected to reach 55 and 45 storeys. Trinity Centre, \na\u00a0LeBreton Flats development approved in 2018\u00a0with a\u00a0towering 65-storey building\n, still hasn't gotten off the ground.\nNeither developer responded to multiple requests for comment about whether those projects are going ahead. But\u00a0other companies are pitching new highrise projects now working their way through the city's approvals process, and at least some\u00a0proponents are confident that they'll get built, sooner or later.\nThe location of three highrise projects above 40 storeys already approved but not built, including Trinity Centre and the Sky, plus 15 projects still winding their way through the development approvals process.\n \n(CBC News)\n\"The market's there in Ottawa, and if anything it's just simply going to grow,\" said Tim Smith of Urban Strategies Inc., an urban design consulting firm that has worked with the City of Ottawa and local developers. \"Whatever the lull there is now is going to be a bit of a blip.\"\nHe said towers\u00a0are at\u00a0least part of the solution to affordability, as Canadian cities look to welcome record-high numbers of immigrants. As long as highrise projects make a real effort to enhance public space, the added density can energize communities.\n\"There's sort of a bit of an aversion to highrise developments coming into areas that historically have been mostly low-rise, but it really is the way that Canadian cities generally, and Ottawa in particular, needs to evolve,\" Smith said.\n\"You have to get beyond the height of buildings, and the towers, and recognize that the density that comes with those developments can have a real net benefit for an area.\u00a0It supports the transit.\u00a0It brings more life to local businesses.\"\n265 Centrum\nToronto-based Bayview Group is looking\u00a0to bring another highrise project to\u00a0Orl\u00e9ans, the second ever\u00a0\nafter Brigil's Petrie Landing development\n. But Bayview's towers would be taller, rising 40, 35 and 30 storeys.\nAn architect's drawing of the proposed 265 Centrum development.\n \n(Fotenn)\nThe site just east of Place d'Orl\u00e9ans shopping centre is within walking distance of a planned O-Train station and right in the middle of a city-designated development hub.\nTwo of the towers would be purely residential, while the third also has office and ground-floor retail. Together they would contain more than 1,000 housing units, including some townhouse-like homes.\nA design brief says the towers are inspired by \"floating chunks of ice in the Ottawa River,\" with \"prismatic geometries\" that evoke the winter landscape.\nSam Gulamani, managing director and general counsel for the Bayview Group, said the project still needs site plan approval from the city. After that, the group will determine whether the units will be condos or rentals.\nHe couldn't give a specific timeline for when construction would begin after approval. He pointed to financial head winds that make such projects difficult in the short run, from higher interest rates weighing on demand to inflationary pressures on building costs.\n\"In the long run, we're very confident in Orl\u00e9ans and in this project,\" he said.\u00a0\"We think that it adds something to the skyline in Orl\u00e9ans that hasn't been there.\u00a0We also think that there is a shortage of housing, so we're building\u00a0something that is going to be in demand.\n\"We don't get the approval just to sit on it,\" he added.\u00a0\"We get the approval with the intent to build it.\"\nKanata North\nMain and Main Developments is proposing a 5.5 hectare project at March Road and Terry Fox Drive that would transform an area of Kanata North now spotted with low-to-mid-rise tech complexes.\nAn architect's rendering of March and Main's 2,100-unit Kanata North development.\n \n(SvN Architects)\nA design from SvN Architects foresees five towers reaching up to 30 storeys, plus several mid-rise buildings, with 2,100 housing units in total. It also includes a public park, plazas, bike paths, retail at ground level and two office buildings.\nOne of the few proposals located far from any planned O-Train station, the Kanata North project lies alongside a bus rapid transit corridor planned for March Road where the city is looking to direct mixed-use development to \nenliven the existing tech district\n.\nMain and Main didn't respond to a request for comment about its plans. But Smith said highrise developments can make sense when strategically located, even in the most suburban of suburbs.\n\"You have to pick your spots,\" he said.\u00a0\"I'm not saying towers make sense everywhere in the suburbs.\u00a0You don't plop them\u00a0into the middle of low-rise neighbourhoods that are healthy and sustainable and valued, but there are places on commercial corridors and commercial nodes where that kind of intensification generally is going to be appropriate.\"\nLansdowne 2.0\nThree highrise towers are an integral part of the plan to finance a $332-million rebuild of the north-side stadium stands at Lansdowne Park, \nalong with a new arena for the Ottawa 67's\n.\nThe city is looking to sell air rights over the stands that would permit towers of 40, 34 and 29 storeys. They'd sit above a podium loaded with commercial space.\nAn artist's rendering of the proposed Landowne 2.0 redevelopment.\n \n(Fotenn)\nThe proposal has already received a stamp of approval from the last council\n that allowed staff to launch public consultations and seek a developer interested in buying the air rights. It will have to come back to council for final approval.\n2000 City Park\nOttawa-based Colonnade Bridgeport is applying for a zoning bylaw change that could allow it to build as many as\u00a0eight towers with an estimated\u00a02,250 housing units near the 417-174 split.\nA rendering of the 2000 City Park Dr. project by Neuf Architects.\n \n(Neuf Architects)\nBonnie Martell, the company's development manager, said the plan is to proceed gradually, with a first stage including five towers ranging from 20 to 30 storeys including about 1,200 units. A design\u00a0was included in\u00a0a press release Tuesday,\u00a0though Martel said it remains \"fairly conceptual.\"\nThe site is a short walk from Blair O-Train station. Martel called it a \"transit-oriented development.\" She said the site is attractive because it's already fairly well established, with amenities and pedestrian activity.\nShe said the hope is to address zoning issues by the end of this year, then move onto site plan approvals in 2024 with construction to start \"shortly thereafter, depending on market conditions.\"\n\"Our\u00a0intent is very much to move this forward and we have investors that are aligned with moving this forward,\" Martell said.\n829 Carling Ave.\nThis is the only single-tower project on the list. Claridge is proposing to build another highrise across the street from its existing Icon tower at the corner of Preston and Carling.\nThe project was initially slated to reach 60 storeys, but the current concept before the city is for a 40-storey tower.\nA rendering of Claridge's 40-storey design across the street from its existing Icon building. An outline of another tall building sits on the site of Richcraft's the Sky project.\n \n(Fotenn)\nNeil Malhotra, chief financial officer of Claridge Homes, said he's not sure that height is final. It could conceivably reach above 40 storeys as the proposal continues to navigate the city's approval process.\nMalhotra said it's tough to predict how quickly the project will move if it gets approval.

Just west of St. Laurent Shopping Centre, the area is now mostly commercial and industrial, but the city has designated it a hub\u00a0to promote dense development.\nAccording to a design brief submitted with the city, the two most prominent towers will feature \"unique dynamic steel elements\" that run the full height of the buildings.\nFormer Greyhound station\nLocal developer Brigil is proposing to build a trio of highrise towers on \nthe site of the now-demolished Greyhound terminal on Catherine Street\n.\nAn architect's rendering of the project Brigil is looking to build over the now demolished Greyhound bus terminal.\n \n(Brigil)\nIt is applying for a zoning change since height limits are currently set at 25 storeys in the area, which is currently surrounded by low-rise buildings.\nThe plan includes a 26-storey tower to the east and a 36-storey tower to the west, with a 40-storey one in the middle, all on six-storey podiums. The plan would provide about 1,000 housing units, as well as a public park and a pedestrian path cutting through the long block.\nThe local Centretown Community Association has said \nit wants more affordable housing from the project in exchange for accepting the shadows the towers would cast over the neighbourhood\n.\n1047 Richmond Rd.\nFengate Development Holdings is proposing to build three towers of 36, 38 and 40 storeys overlooking the Ottawa River near Lincoln Heights.\nAn architect's rendering of three towers proposed by Fengate Asset Management for 1047 Richmond Rd.\n \n(Fotenn)\nThe plan foresees more than 1,300 housing units, mostly with one or two bedrooms, plus commercial space on the ground floor. It would be located right across the street from the planned New Orchard O-Train station, in an area already packed with apartment buildings.\nStill, the proposed development would dwarf its neighbours and tower over a low-rise development to the south.\u00a0\n665 Albert St.\nDream Asset Management, one of the companies behind the Zibi project along the Ottawa River, is looking to build a two-tower highrise complex on LeBreton Flats right beside Pimisi O-Train station.\nAn architect's rendering of Dream's LeBreton Flats development project.\n \n(Dream)\nAs proposed, the 31- and 36-storey towers are among the more visually striking buildings currently pitched for Ottawa. They would include 607 rental units \u2014 with 41 per cent deemed affordable \u2014 as well as retail, a community hub and a park.\nCouncil approved the necessary rezoning last year, and the company is now working to finalize approvals. Dream's VP of development, Justin Robitaille, did not have an exact timeline for construction, but said the company is working to bring it \"to\u00a0fruition in the near future.\"\n2026 Scott\nHoppner Holdings is applying to build two 40 storey towers right across from the proposed Westboro LRT station. Colonnade Bridgeport said it's also involved in the project.\nKen Hoppner, a partner in Hoppner Holdings, said the aim is to start work in the third quarter of next year. The plan has changed twice before, from a three tower project pitched in 2022 to a two tower design with a link connecting two skyscrapers.\nA closeup of the facades of the towers proposed for 2026 Scott St.\n \n(Hobin Architecture)\nThe current design dispenses with the link, but retains a podium design that steps down toward a low-rise neighbourhood to the south, revealing terraces open to the sky.\nAccording to the design brief for the second plan, the project aims to transform the site into a \"bustling urban hub\" with a landscaped pedestrian plaza.\n2 Robinson\nThis four-tower development in the southernmost corner of Sandy Hill, near Lees,\u00a0is\u00a0interesting in part for the history of the site.\nIt formerly hosted an Iranian Cultural Centre that was \nforfeited as part of a lawsuit seizing Iranian property to\u00a0compensate victims of militant groups\u00a0its government bankrolled\n. At the time, the site was worth an estimated $3.9 million.\nA rendering of the proposed four-tower development at 2 Robinson.\n \n(2 Robinson Property Limited Partnership)\nBased on submissions and a land title search, the developer appears to be Montreal-based\u00a0Place Dor\u00e9e Real Estate Holdings Inc.\u00a0Its original five-tower design has now been revised to two 32-storey and two 28-storey towers. The project would provide 1,440 housing units, some retail space and a public park with an amphitheatre seating area.\nA short walk to Lees O-Train station, the site is again in a hub area where the city is looking to concentrate development.\nStandard Bread Building\nCLV Group Developments is looking to preserve Hintonburg's Standard Bread Building, recently declared a heritage property, while adding three towers of 35, 33 and 30 storeys.\u00a0\nThe former bread factory, which the city considers \"a rare example of an early 20th century industrial building,\" is now home to the Enriched Bread Artists\u00a0collective.\u00a0\nAn architect's design of the proposed development at the current Standard Bread Building in Hintonburg.\n \n(CLV Group)\nIt would take up an entire block right next to the future Corso Italia station. The proposal dates back to 2021, \nthough an even larger\u00a0plan for the site from a different developer goes back to 2018\n.\nThe current plan involves 846 residential units,\u00a0office space and two small public green spaces. Retail would face Gladstone Avenue and a new pedestrian street parallel to the rail line.\nEach of the towers would sit on four- or five-storey red brick and concrete podiums. Black metal panels are intended to\u00a0\"reflect the industrial character of the surrounding area.\" The towers themselves would be mostly grey and white, though the tallest one would have hints of red.\nCLV did not respond to requests about its plans or timeline.\n2946 Baseline Rd.\nBaseline is set to become a magnet for highrise development under a slew of projects now up for approval, with many centred near Merivale Road.\nBut one of the most ambitious projects is\u00a0further west, with towers of 32 and 28 storeys proposed near the Queensway-Carleton hospital, along with a squatter nine-storey building. The height requires a zoning change, which is\u00a0expected to come before the city's planning and housing committee in September.\nBrigil's project at 2946 Baseline Road.\n \n(Neuf)\nThe developer\u00a0is Ottawa-Gatineau-based Brigil, which brought on architect Neuf\u00a0for a design it calls \"playful\" and \"dynamic.\" The project would provide 700 dwelling units. It includes a public park, a small number of townhouses and retail.\nThough Baseline itself\u00a0doesn't lie on an O-Train lie,\u00a0\nthe entire corridor has been designated a bus rapid transit route in the city's transit plan\n, which significantly relaxes zoning restrictions in a bid to welcome more density.\n70-80 Woodridge\nFerguslea Properties is looking to add\u00a0towers of 40 and 37 storeys\u00a0near the site of its existing Accora Village development, right next to Bayshore Shopping Centre.\nA rendering of Ferguslea Properties proposed towers near Bayshore.\n \n(Fotenn)\nIt would create up to 584 residential units, along with retail at ground level and an open space with a splash pad and public art. It abuts a site where a project to construct two slightly shorter towers is also under consideration.\n1640-1660 Carling Ave.\nRioCan Holdings is pitching six buildings up to 40 storeys on the site of the Canadian Tire building on Carling Avenue.\nIt's expected to hold 1,715 dwelling units, and would include a new public park and ground floor retail. The tallest towers, at 40, 37, 30 and 22 storeys, are proposed as rental buildings. There's also a 20 storey tower anticipated to hold condos, and a nine-storey retirement home.\u00a0\nA rendering of RioCan's six-building development proposed for Carling Avenue.\n \n(Hobin Architecture)\nBut it's unclear exactly what the buildings\u00a0will look like, with the current design little more than a featureless shell of six towers.

        "content": "A proposed pilot project in Kingston, Ont.,\u00a0is fuelling discussion\u00a0about the role\u00a0of for-profit companies in the textile recycling sector, which has traditionally been dominated by charitable groups.\nKingston city council voted to defer the decision on its partnership with Renewalsquared Inc. to its September meeting after\u00a0several councillors raised concerns about the project taking away donations from charities and thrift stores.\nThe project would see the company place up to 20 donation bins on city-owned property including parking lots at city parks, community centres and arenas. The company would be responsible for collecting the donations and ensuring the area\u00a0around the bins is kept clean.\nThe project would come at no cost to the city.\u00a0\nCouncillor\u00a0concerned\nCoun. Don Amos, who has 25 years of experience working in the charity sector, is against the idea.\n\u00a0\"I have a problem with this,\" he said at the July 11 council meeting.\n\"As a city, we're promoting and reaching out to a for-profit company when we have a number of charities in the area that are reliant on donations from Kingstonians.\"\nCoun.\u00a0Lisa Osanic\u00a0said the company may fill a void because while charities want items for resale, Renewalsquared would take unmatched socks and stained or damaged linens and towels.\nKingston conducted a residential curbside waste audit in 2022 that found about 4.5 per cent of waste was made up of textiles \u2014 an average of 14.4 kilograms per household, a staff report presented to council said.\nThat audit also found nearly half of the household textiles being thrown into the garbage were towels and linens, an average of nearly seven kilograms per household.\nAerial view of used clothes discarded in the Atacama desert, in Alto Hospicio, Iquique, Chile.\n \n(Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images)\nUsed textile market 'saturated'\nMyra Hird, a professor at Queen's University's\u00a0School of Environmental Studies, said groups that collect used textiles to recycle and reuse\u00a0are inundated.\n\"The sad fact is that we are donating far more than all of these charities and companies combined can deal with,\" she told\u00a0CBC's \nOntario Morning\n\u00a0on Wednesday.\n\"Only a fraction of those textiles are actually going to be sold in these places, and they only stay on the ...\u00a0hangers, on the shelves for a certain period of time.\"\nShe said the \"vast majority\" of donations either end up in landfills or are sent to other countries.\u00a0\n\"And those countries are saturated as well. So they're actually sort of open dumping these textiles, in some cases they're setting them on fire, which has really bad environmental consequences,\" she said.\n\"We're just simply at a point where the used textile market is saturated.\"\nOnly 25 per cent of the materials donated to Value Village ever make it to the sales floor; the rest are recycled.\n \n(CBC News)\nTrevor McCaw, CEO of Renewalsquared, echoed Hird,\u00a0saying 85 per cent of textiles end up in landfills, so there's plenty for everyone.\nMcCaw said the pilot could involve giving some clothing or extra funding to\u00a0non-profits.\nWhat's to be done?\nHird\u00a0said\u00a0there's one thing people can do to help: stop buying new items.\n\"What individuals can do is rather than buy new textiles, new clothing, new curtains et cetera, we can buy used,\" she said.\n\"The more we can keep something that's already being produced in circulation, the more we can use that, the better for the environment.\"\nCan fast fashion slow down? It's not that simple\nTextile waste is a growing problem \u2014 and Canada still isn't doing enough to solve it, experts say\nHird said textile production has an immense impact\u00a0on the environment.\u00a0\n\"If we were to stop the production of textiles around the world ... that would be the equivalent, in terms of CO2 emissions and water use, of halting all flights on the globe and all shipping,\" she said.\nAt the council meeting, Coun. Gary Oosterhof agreed with Amos and moved to defer the decision. The deferral passed.\nCity staff have been\u00a0instructed to reach out to charities for their perspective on the project, and to Renewalsquared\u00a0to get more information before council at its September meeting.\nMcCaw said the company will be available to answer questions from councillors at September's meeting when the matter comes up for a vote again.\n\"Partly, it's an education on the problem, how big it is,\" he said.\nThe pilot\u00a0would run for nine months, after which another waste audit would be conducted to determine how effective the project was in diverting textiles from the waste stream.\nHere's where your donated clothing really ends up\nTextiles are the next frontier in recycling for cities looking to cut waste",

David Hill said a \"deep maintenance issue\" was recognized at the splash pad over the winter, and it required substantive repairs before it could operate.\n\"The contractors are working with Hydro Ottawa. There's a strike right now, and so it's just delaying the process,\" Hill said.\nThe repairs were completed\u00a0mid-June, but\u00a0the developer of the subdivision put in a\u00a0connection request just two days before the strike started on June 26. In an email, the city said the\u00a0work was forecasted to be complete by mid-summer.\nPower outage? Prepare to wait as Hydro Ottawa workers walk off the job\nNow, nearing the end of July, it's finally up and running. Hydro Ottawa confirmed in an\u00a0email that the splash pad was reconnected on Thursday and was working the next day.\nFor some parents, the delay was frustrating.\nCatherine Enticknap said her three young kids had been\u00a0hoping to make use of the splash pad since school ended in June.\u00a0\nShe called the city three times since the late spring. Each time, she said she didn't get a straight answer as to why the splash pad hadn't been turned on.\n\"First, the contractors didn't do a good job. It's for safety reasons.

Six require further investigation, and the final car (which is undergoing unrelated work in Kingston) will be inspected later on, according to Richard Holder, the city's director of\u00a0engineering services.\nNo word on LRT resumption expected until at least Monday\nCommunication amid LRT shutdown falls short, crisis experts say\nYou can watch Monday's\u00a0media briefing\u00a0in the player below:\nAxle hub assemblies will\u00a0be redesigned\nBearings have been a recurring problem since the Confederation Line\u00a0opened in fall 2019.\u00a0\nNearly\u00a0two years ago, the entire system was shut down for\u00a0nearly a week because of a similar problem. Weeks later, LRT service was suspended for nearly two months in the wake of another malfunction.\nTo\u00a0address long-standing bearing problems in the axles of light-rail cars, the axle hub assembly is going to be completely redesigned, Mayor Mark Sutcliffe announced Monday.\n\"That alone\u00a0will not solve all of our\u00a0issues, but I and the team at OC Transpo are hopeful that this redesign will be a giant step forward. At last\u00a0we are working on the root problem, and not just the issues that arise from it,\" Sutcliffe said.\nRTG to handle costs for new assembly\nA preliminary\u00a0design of a new axle hub assembly has already been submitted, according to Nicolas Truchon, CEO of Rideau Transit Group. A final design needs to be signed off on, followed by making a prototype and \"significant testing.\"\n\"This is not a small undertaking,\" Truchon said.\u00a0\nIt could take about 12 to 18 months\u00a0to come up with a final design, test it and install it on every LRT car.\nMore details are expected in the coming weeks, Amilcar said.\nThe entire cost for the new hub, testing and installation will be charged to Rideau Transit Group.\nShort-term fixes\nTo help deal with the bearing issue in the short term, equipment will be installed at 16 points along the Confederation Line\u00a0to grease up the track in tight curves, Holder said. It will take several weeks to complete the installations.\nStaff are also working to optimize a maintenance plan for the system, Holder said.\nR1 buses are currently running the length of the line, except for Cyrville station. A shuttle instead connects Cyrville and St-Laurent stations.\nPeople have \nexpressed frustration over the R1 bus service\n, including capacity.\nOC\u00a0Transpo is trying to be agile in responding to complaints and suggestions about R1 replacement service, according to interim city manager\u00a0Wendy Stephanson.\nMedia briefings will be held daily to provide updates until service resumes.\nTesting and work done so far\nOC Transpo still doesn't know what the root cause is. A report is expected in the coming months.\nIn addition to inspecting all the axle hub bearings for every LRT car after the latest issue, the entire track was inspected visually\u00a0and no issues were identified, according to Holder.\nThe rails have been measured to see how they're holding up, and those results are being analyzed. Several restraining rails have been reset to optimum positions, and the remaining restraining rails will be adjusted by July 30.\nOC Transpo\u00a0has also conducted multiple test runs\u00a0using\u00a0a train with axles equipped with monitors and sensors, to find out how different temperatures, weights, speeds and restraining\u00a0rail positions may be affecting the bearings.\nPreliminary indications are that \"repetitive loading cycles contribute to degraded performance,\" according to a slide presented by Holder.",

        "content": "The popularity of a new Canadian program meant to attract American tech workers north of the border should serve as a warning to U.S. immigration officials and lawmakers, American immigration lawyers say.\nEarlier this week, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada opened up an application portal for immigrants in the United States who hold H1-B visas that allow\u00a0them to work in the tech industry there.\nThe portal\u00a0was designed to draw these visa holders\u00a0to Canada on three-year open work permits. It worked \u2014 the program reached its 10,000-applicant cap within two days.\n\"It's a smart move by Canada. They see a need to fill in their own economy and available workers who are not being properly used ... by the United States,\" said Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, head of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\"This [policy] was really directly targeted at our program and our failures at our program, and really giving an opportunity to H1-B workers who may not have that opportunity in the United States anymore.\"\nSharvari Dhalal-Deini of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said Canada's policy is a smart move that takes advantage of the United States' failure to reform its immigration policies.\n \n(Submitted)\nUp to 600,000 immigrants in the States may hold H1-B visas. These documents are directly tied to employment\u00a0and immigration advocates there say they provide poor pathways to permanent residency.\nAn H1-B holder in the U.S.\u00a0who loses their job\u00a0would have to leave the country within 60 days \u2014 unless they find new employment within that time period.\nIn Canada's search to attract tech workers, are other migrant workers getting lost in the mix?\nProgram to attract tech workers from the U.S. hits capacity one day after opening\nDhalal-Deini said immigration advocates in the U.S. have been asking for\u00a0reform of the immigration system\u00a0for years, but lawmakers are stuck in a political deadlock over the issue.\n\"It's a big talking point for the [political] parties to say, 'Oh we support immigration,'\" she\u00a0said \u2014 but undocumented migration\u00a0from Mexico\u00a0has turned the idea of reforming immigration policy into a\u00a0highly partisan brawl.\n\"At the very least, Canadians have brought to light the fact that there are other, smarter countries with better immigration policies that actually value science, technology, engineering and math,\" said immigration lawyer Ashwin Sharma\u00a0of the Sharma Law Office in Jacksonville, Fla.\n\"Perhaps the U.S. will start doing the same.\"\nWill the tech workers coming to Canada stay here?\nSharma also acknowledged that the open nature of the Canadian work permit, coupled with the higher salaries generally on offer in U.S. tech industries,\u00a0may mean that not all applicants are looking to move to Canada on a long-term basis.\n\"It could be that the H1-B workers are coming over\u00a0for a short period of time to perhaps kill off some unemployment period of time,\" he said.\n\"It remains to be seen how many will remain in Canada.\"\u00a0\nHe said the speed with which the program hit its application cap is still\u00a0remarkable.\nMeta is one of many tech giants that have laid off thousands of workers in the last few months. The cuts are what prompted the Canadian government to attempt to draw U.S. tech workers here.\n \n(Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images)\nImmigration Minister Sean Fraser said Canada has other advantages that make up for lower salaries.\u00a0\n\"Tech workers who are here on a work permit have a unique opportunity to transition to permanent residency,\" he said.\nHe said his department would follow up on the application process over the next few months before deciding whether it would expand this policy or others \u2014 part of what he calls Canada's \"digital nomad\" strategy.\nCanada wants to woo 'digital nomads.' Can we compete?\nCanada to launch 'digital nomad strategy,' other measures to woo international talent\n\"We're going to want to see whether people are in fact landing jobs in the sector with companies who are looking to experience growth,\" Fraser said.\nThe minister\u00a0said he expects to see the first applicants arrive in\u00a0Canada this summer or fall.\nHe said he has not heard from U.S. immigration officials since starting the program.\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to a CBC News request for comment.\u00a0\nThe Canadian online portal has faced criticism for glitches that prevented some applicants from completing their entries.\nFraser said the government will address those problems if it decides to relaunch the program.",

I ride the buses quite a bit. And so I've accumulated quite a bit of knowledge of this system and this is something I started doing many months ago,\" she told host Giacomo Panico on \nOttawa Morning\n.\nPrimeau's maps became a Reddit sensation recently, with followers calling her a hero and a lifesaver. With transit officials\u00a0warning the LRT likely won't be up and running until the end of July \u2014\u00a0at the earliest \u2014\u00a0the maps are likely to keep growing in popularity.\n \nI have this knowledge, it might be of use to people now that the train is down again for an unforeseeable amount of time.\n- Ella Primeau, University of Ottawa engineering student\n\"When the train's down, I use these routes to avoid the R1, mostly because I would rather take the shortcut route, the side street route.\u2026\u00a0And so I thought, I have this knowledge, it might be of use to people now that the train is down again for an unforeseeable amount of time.\"\nThe replacement buses were especially crowded during morning and afternoon rush hour, especially when they were running along\u00a0Queen Street downtown. The idea was to keep the buses travelling as close to the LRT route as possible.\nHowever, the ensuing gridlock on narrow Queen Street led to overcrowding and frustration. The replacement buses have since been rerouted through downtown's Albert and Slater streets, a move Primeau supports.\n\"It'll definitely reduce travel times on the R1. I think that crowding is still an issue.\u2026\u00a0There was also the rerouting at Lees station, which again saves a lot of travel time but I don't know where the balance is between optimizing this route and having a bunch of shuttle services that just confuse\u00a0passengers.\"\nLRT won't reopen for at least another week\nOngoing, full LRT shutdown blamed on another bearing problem\nThe sweet 16\nWhile you might not save a ton\u00a0of time taking Primeau's suggested alternate routes, they could help you hop onto a bus with an available place to sit\u00a0and a shorter wait time at the bus stop.\u00a0\nA route like the 16 though, can really ease the headaches of finding replacement shuttle routes.\n\"The 16 stops at almost every train station downtown. So it stops at Parliament, it stops at Lyon, and then goes all the way to Tunney's Pasture. And so, if you are someone that lives downtown and you want a quick way to get to Tunney's Pasture ... that's I think probably the best.\"\nPrimeau's maps are available on her Instagram account, @ellalikesbuses, and they're not just focused on downtown commuters. She details many options for Barrhaven, Orl\u00e9ans and Kanata-Stittsville riders.\nPrimeau's maps provide transit users the kind of alternate routes Doug Hempstead provides drivers on his morning and afternoon traffic reports.\u00a0\n\"They kind of crisscross through the R1 and that's emblematic of the way they're routed,\" she said. While they're not meant to be geographically accurate, they \"really just communicate where these buses go, which stations they stop at, and so in doing that, people can use these to just avoid the R1 and get right to the stations that they want to go to.\"\nBut will the popularity of her maps render her alternates obsolete if they're overused?\n\"I think that a lot more people are going to be aware of these alternate routes and maybe there will be crowding on these alternate routes as well. I haven't kind of set out to explore that, but I do believe it is still more likely that you will get a seat.\"",

No results from those tests have been released, though the city has revealed inspections of 24 axle hub assemblies have uncovered\u00a0no issues.\u00a0\nBefore the bearing issue was detected on July 17, an earlier inspection was\u00a0done around the first weekend of Bluesfest: after the Shania Twain concert, but before equally-high-wattage acts such as Foo Fighters\u00a0and\u00a0Ludacris\u00a0with\u00a0Pitbull,\u00a0who also played on the\u00a0LeBreton Flats stage.\u00a0\nIf there had been a problem with the bearing at that point, it would have been identified, the city said.\u00a0\nOn July 4, the Ottawa Police Service said the Pimisi LRT station 'does not facilitate the efficient handling of substantial crowds.' The next day, the city and the police service said the station is safe.  \n \n(Guy Quenneville/CBC)\nBluesfest unquestionably brought more people than normal to Pimisi station.\u00a0\nAccording to statistics provided by the city, about 160,000 customers entered and exited Pimisi\u00a0Station between 3 p.m. to 12 a.m. over the course of the festival. That's compared to 8,050 customer trips from June 8-11 and June 14-18 during the same time of day.\u00a0\n\"I visited Pimisi\u00a0Station after Shania, Foo Fighters and Pitbull,\" Bluesfest spokesperson\u00a0Joe Reilly said.\u00a0\"It was very busy and people had to line up and wait.\u00a0But overall the staff did a good job of getting people on trains.\"\nPremature to speculate, Senators say\nMayor Mark Sutcliffe\u00a0said development on a new arena and major events centre, wherever it goes, isn't going to happen quickly.\u00a0\n\"We have a lot of time to think through what's the best location,\" he said, adding, \"I hope that, by the time we get to that point, we'll have a safe, reliable light rail system.\"\nA spokesperson for the Senators said via email that \"with the distance between now and the downtown arena project, it would be premature to speculate.\"\nToronto-based Michael Andlauer, owner of the Brantford Bulldogs junior hockey team, \nsigned an agreement in principle\n last month to become the new owner of the Senators. He did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for the Ottawa Senators said the team has strong relationship with the City of Ottawa. \n \n(Guy Quenneville/CBC)\nThe NCC said its CEO, Tobi Nussbaum, was not available for an interview.\u00a0\nAccording to the NCC's website\n, the consortium behind the event centre project, which is led by the Senators, \"continues to make good progress on its proposal\" and \"the target date to enter into a lease agreement is fall 2023.\"\nAnalysis\nNHL commissioner puts non-LeBreton Flats arena locations in play\nNCC confident new Senators owners want LeBreton Flats arena\nNussbaum\u00a0said last month\n that while it's possible other lands may be chosen, \"Until otherwise notified, the message has been clear to us that there is a strong interest in building an arena [at LeBreton Flats].\"\nThe NCC will work with\u00a0OC Transpo\u00a0\"to ensure robust transportation demand management and emergency strategies are in place to support transit use at LeBreton Flats,\" the organization said by email last week.\nAny development application for a proposed events centre will require a \"detailed\" transportation impact assessment, the city said in its own emailed statement.\u00a0",

        "content": "Ottawa's former city registry office was on the move Saturday, at the leisurely pace of about 3.5 metres per hour.\nWith a 149-year-old building, it's unwise to rush.\nA team of engineers was scheduled to spend about\u00a0five hours pushing the 500-tonne building 18 metres to the north as part of a plan to preserve, restore\u00a0and embed it into\u00a0a 21-storey tower just east of Rideau Centre at 70 Nicholas St.\nThe building dates back to 1874 and is one of about a dozen remaining registry offices across the province, according to Barry Padolsky,\u00a0the heritage consultant at the\u00a0site. It was part of Ottawa's former judicial district, along with the former Carleton County Courthouse and county jail.\n\"For the last 40 years, it's been vacant,\" he said.\u00a0\"And sadly so, because it's such a wonderful icon.\"\nA rendering of the proposed 21-storey Rideau Registry project, Cadillac Fairview\u2019s first residential rental development in Canada.\n \n(Commonwealth Historic Resource Management and Barry Padolsky Associates Inc.)\nHe explained how the team inserted a steel cradle under the building, with holes poked through the masonry to accommodate beams.\u00a0Then workers jacked the whole structure\u00a0up and slid it along rails at an imperceptible speed.\n\"They need a lot of hydraulic force to push it sideways, but it has to be pushed evenly.\u00a0Otherwise it cracks, so that's what they're doing\u00a0\u2014 and successfully,\" said Padolsky.\nHe said collapse is a risk. The vaults inside the building can be especially tricky. But everything seemed to be proceeding as planned on Saturday afternoon.\n\"It's, as we speak, approaching its final location, so I'm very excited about this.\"\nCompany that helped seal up Chernobyl pitches in\nThe developer\u00a0is Cadillac Fairview, which brought on Mammoet, a company with the self-described mission of moving \"big objects,\" to play a leading role.\nIt previously helped install the\u00a0containment dome over the destroyed reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The company also helped recover the Kursk, a Soviet nuclear submarine stuck in the 108-metre-deep seabed on the edge of the Arctic Ocean.\n\"So we're in very good hands,\" said Padolsky.\nIt would have been cheaper to deconstruct the building and move it in pieces, but both the city and Heritage Ottawa recommended keeping it whole as the best conservation option.\nSaturday's efforts caught the eye of a handful of curious onlookers. Dave\u00a0Valentine said he's stopped by about 15 times, day after day,\u00a0to watch the preparations and the move itself.\nHe said he's fascinated by the mechanics of it, and impressed that it's even possible.\n\"It requires quite a bit of heavy equipment to move a building,\" he said. \"I think it's a pretty good idea. It's quite an interesting looking building.\"\nRestored registry office could host bar or caf\u00e9\nThe building had reached the end of the rails when CBC returned to the site on Sunday. Brian Salpeter, senior vice president of development at Cadillac Fairview, said it was successfully moved in two phases and is now in place.\nBut\u00a0there's still more work left on the agenda. Padolsky explained that crews will have to dig a two-level parking garage around and under the heritage building. He called that \"a major tour de force.\"\n\"The last phase will be transferring the city registry office from its temporary steel piles to the top of the concrete parking garage, and then the ice cream on top of that is restoring it,\" he said.\nThis 149-year-old building was moved 18 metres over five hours\n1 day ago\nDuration \n1:00\nA team of engineers moved Ottawa's former city registry office Saturday as part of a plan to embed it into a 21-storey tower next to Rideau Centre.\nThat will include replacing a previously demolished brick chimney.\nThe development plan for the site foresees an outdoor plaza and caf\u00e9\u00a0or bar at the registry office, which will intersect a three-storey glass atrium and also serve as a lobby entrance.\nCity registry offices were used to register and store\u00a0property records like deeds, mortgages and lot plans. According to a conservation plan submitted with the city, the building has the appearance of a little temple\u00a0\"dedicated to the sacredness of private property.\"\nPadolsky expects that it will take about two years until it's restored, occupied and open for the public to come and marvel at the beautiful brick\u00a0barrel-vaulted\u00a0ceilings inside.",

There was a layer of stratus cloud below us as we descended down over Lake Winnipeg.\"\nThe Boeing 767 became known as the 'Gimli Glider' after safely landing with no power at an airstrip near Gimli, Man.\n \n(CBC)\nBut after another pilot said they wouldn't make it to Winnipeg,\u00a0Pearson decided to make a turn toward Gimli.\nHe had three choices to slow the plane down: one was to do a 360-degree turn, but that could mean losing\u00a0track of the airstrip. Another was to try\u00a0\"S-turns\" \u2014but they may not have had enough time to reduce their speed.\nThe third was to try\u00a0a \"sideslip\"\u00a0\u2014\u00a0something Canadian pilots train for in case of engine failure.\nPearson opted for the last, angling the plane sideways so the wings pointed diagonally, allowing the plane to slow down and reduce its altitude.\n\"We touched down 800 feet down the runway \u2014 and normally the ending spot is about 1,000 feet,\" he said.\nAfter using the brakes to steer, the plane eventually came to a halt.\nAll things considered, it was a good landing for Pearson\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but he knows it scared a lot of people, including Dion.\nThe plane landed on an abandoned airstrip, which had been turned into a race track, on July 23, 1983.\n \n(Canadian Press/Winnipeg Free Press/Wayne Glowacki)\n\"We just sort of went into shock when the lights went out, and we were told to go back to our seats and put through emergency procedures,\" Dion said.\n\"You just kind of are spaced out.\u2026 But you do know that something is dreadfully wrong and you're wondering if you are going to die.\"\nOther people were also watching the landing nearby \u2014 the Winnipeg Sports Car Club was out on the airstrip, which had been converted into a race track.\nAs it Happened: The Archive Edition - The Flight Time Episode\nPeople were also out having barbecues, and kids were riding their bikes along the track.\nMeeting people along the way\nPearson and Dion aren't the only two whose fates have been intertwined since that day.\n\"That's the best part of the whole thing, is the people that we've met along the way.\u2026 We've met some wonderful, wonderful people and we wouldn't have otherwise,\" Dion said.\nThat includes Barb Gluck, president of the Gimli Glider Museum in Gimli, which features the plane's fuelling system, the steering wheel, a chair from the cockpit and other pieces of the aircraft.\nGimli Glider museum commemorates 'amazing aviation story'\nGimli Glider parts return to area of historic landing site\nGluck said the exhibit has attracted visitors from around the world.\n\"It's been fascinating, absolutely fascinating, to meet people from around the world and hear their stories of why they have come to see us,\" she said in an interview with\u00a0\nRadio Noon\u00a0\nguest host\u00a0Pat Kaniuga.\n\"We never know who's coming through the door.\"\nRadio Noon Manitoba\n11:29\nMarking the 40th anniversary of the Gimli Glider\nThis weekend marks the 40th anniversary of the Gimli Glider.

        "content": "The Manitoba government has ordered a private\u00a0clinic to stop charging patients for echocardiograms and ultrasounds, nearly six years after they gave the Winnipeg clinic the green light to do so.\nThe directive was given to Prota Clinic by the government last\u00a0Monday, forcing the clinic on Lorimer Boulevard, in southwest Winnipeg,\u00a0to stop\u00a0accepting new doctor requisitions for the diagnostic scans.\u00a0\nThe province's move\u00a0comes on the heels of an announcement in March that the federal government\u00a0\nwould deduct over $350,000\n from\u00a0Manitoba's next health transfer payment because of the\u00a0clinic's continued operations.\u00a0\nThe Liberal government said at that point it was making health-transfer deductions\u00a0from eight provinces related to patient charges levied during 2020-21\u00a0for what Ottawa said were \"medically necessary services that should be accessible to patients at no cost.\"\nProta Clinic announced in December 2017 that it would begin offering medically necessary echocardiograms\u00a0\u2014 heart ultrasounds \u2014 for a $650 fee. With Manitobans waiting almost nine months for an echocardiogram at that point, doctors at Prota said the service gave people another option.\u00a0 \nThe federal government immediately raised concerns about the move, \nstating publicly\n that it violated the Canada Health Act.\nFeds raise flag over for-profit ultrasounds offered by Winnipeg clinic\nOttawa plans to crack down on doctors charging for medically necessary health care\nHowever,\u00a0the provincial Progressive Conservative government\u00a0\nwelcomed Prota's plans\n, with then health minister Kelvin Goertzen saying in 2017 he was \"disappointed\" that the feds would look to \"reduce health-care options for Manitobans.\"\nThe clinic later started charging patients for\u00a0ultrasounds as another diagnostic service.\u00a0\nProta Clinic president and medical director Dr. Dimitrios Balageorge is shown during a 2017 tour of the clinic, where he touted its fee-based services as a way to cut down on the wait-list for elective cardiograms. \n \n(CBC)\nHealth Minister Audrey Gordon declined to do an interview with\u00a0CBC or to answer why the government changed its\u00a0mind about the clinic's operations.\u00a0\nIn a prepared statement, her spokesperson,\u00a0Eleni Hague, said the government takes its responsibilities\u00a0under the Canada Health Act seriously, with \"timely care for Manitobans that is publicly funded with government oversight\" a top priority.\nProvince touts elimination of pandemic backlog for ultrasounds, critics suggest wait times still 'too long'\nAccording to recent data provided by\u00a0Shared Health, Manitobans are now waiting almost five months for an elective echocardiogram and over 6,800 patients are on the waiting list.\nThe province's \ndiagnostic imaging dashboard\n says there is\u00a0about a two-month wait for an ultrasound, and over 19,000 people are on the wait-list, according to May 2023 figures.\nProvince could be reimbursed: feds\nThe federal government's diagnostic services policy, which came into effect on April 1, 2020, gives\u00a0the federal government the authority to claw back health transfer funds from any province that allows patients to be charged for medically necessary diagnostic services.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0deductions officially began in March 2023. Using \"best evidence\" available, the federal government estimates Prota Clinic charged patients $353,000 in 2020-21 fiscal year, according to a spokesperson for Health Canada.\u00a0\nThe federal government said it\u00a0invited the province to provide its own data before settling on the deduction, but the Manitoba government never responded.\u00a0\nThe province has until 2025 to be reimbursed for these deductions if it \"eliminates the charges and the circumstances that led to them,\" the federal spokesperson said.\nSask. health minister 'deeply disappointed' by Ottawa's clawback of $750K in transfers over patient fees\nIn response to questions about the impact the province's\u00a0directive\u00a0will have on patients and the clinic, Eleni Balageorge, an administrator with Prota Clinic, said in a prepared statement the clinic is \"unable to provide any comments or further information on the matter, as it falls under the jurisdiction of the provincial government.\"",

        "content": "Phil Fontaine has had a year to reflect since he heard an apology from the head of the Roman Catholic Church, something the former\u00a0Assembly of First Nations national chief fought much of his life to have delivered on Canadian soil.\n\"Without an apology, it would be impossible to forgive,\" Fontaine says after taking a few moments to contemplate the historic moment.\n\"And without forgiveness, there can't be any true healing.\"\nPope Francis asks for 'forgiveness in the name of the church' for abuses at residential schools\nResidential school survivors still waiting for next steps a year after papal visit\nThis week marks a year since Pope Francis arrived in Canada. He delivered his first apology in Maskwacis, a Cree community south of\u00a0Edmonton, in front of thousands of survivors, leaders and community members.\nPope Francis said he was sorry for the Roman Catholic Church's role in the cultural destruction and forced assimilation of\u00a0Indigenous people, which culminated in residential schools.\nThe pontiff would deliver further apologies as he made stops in Alberta, Quebec and Nunavut during the six-day tour. On his flight\u00a0back to Rome, in response to a journalist's question, Francis said the abuses Indigenous Peoples faced amounted to genocide.\nAn Indigenous elder wipes her face as she listens to Pope Francis give an apology during a public event in Iqaluit, Nunavut on July 29, 2022, during his papal visit across Canada.\n \n(Nathan Denette/Canadian Press)\nThe apologies met a mixed response. Many Indigenous people said it was necessary, especially for residential school survivors,\u00a0because it meant the head of the Catholic Church was finally recognizing harms were committed.\nSome criticized Francis for not going far enough. Others thought Indigenous Peoples and organizations should disengage with the\u00a0church altogether because they'd expended enough energy on it. Many called for actions, not words.\nFor Fontaine, the apology was extremely important.\nThe abuse inside the schools was long kept quiet nationally, but\u00a0Fontaine broke the silence in 1990 when he spoke about his own\u00a0experiences at the Fort Alexander Residential School in Manitoba.\nAn estimated 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend\u00a0residential schools. More than 60 per cent of the schools were run\u00a0by the Catholic Church.\n'A long journey'\nFontaine went to the Vatican in 2009 to meet Benedict, who was\u00a0then the pontiff, and requested an apology. Benedict didn't oblige.\nFontaine once again travelled to the Vatican with an Indigenous\u00a0delegation last year. That\u00a0time, Pope Francis delivered his first\u00a0apology and committed to bring his atonement to Canada.\nThe apology may not have been accepted by everyone, but Francis's plea for forgiveness is just part of the journey the church must take, Fontaine says.\n\"We received the apology each in our own way as individuals,\" Fontaine says. \"And we decide as individuals whether we want to\u00a0forgive.\"\nPhil Fontaine, a former Assembly of First Nations national chief, says the Pope's apology was part of the journey that the church must take, even though it may not be accepted by everyone.\n \n(Jaison Empson/CBC)\nDonald Bolen, the Archbishop of Regina, described the papal visit and apology as \"life giving.\" But when Pope Francis left, Bolen\u00a0says, it became even more important for the church to take action.\n\"The real work of reconciliation happens day by day on the ground,\" he says. \"We are on a long journey of reconciliation.\"\nPope Francis asked Canadian Catholics to commit to four things: to ensure history is told in a truthful way; to support Indigenous\u00a0language, culture and traditions; to be an ally in the pursuit of justice; and to appreciate Indigenous wisdom to care for the land\u00a0and environment.\n\"It's easier to say it than to do it,\" Bolen says.\nLISTEN\nThe Pope said he's sorry. So what's next for reconciliation?\nQ&A\nHow Canadian law could change with the Vatican repudiation the Doctrine of Discovery\nBolen reflected on what the church accomplished in the last 12 months. Many dioceses, including his own, have been working on\u00a0providing access to archives. There has been financial support for culture camps and a national fundraising campaign by the Canadian\u00a0Conference of Catholic Bishops.\nEarlier this year, the Vatican formally denounced the 15th-century papal bulls used as the basis for the Doctrine of Discovery, which legitimized the seizure of Indigenous land.\nBolen says the hard daily task for churches on a local level will be building relationships with Indigenous people, listening deeply\u00a0and learning to walk together to improve society.\nBut Bolen recognizes not every non-Indigenous Catholic has committed to reconciliation in the same way. Shifts in society\u00a0happen over a long time, he says.\n\"People are at various places on the journey.\"\n'So much at stake'\nPaul Gareau, an associate dean in Native Studies at the University of Alberta, says he feels \"slightly confused and maybe a\u00a0little hopeful\" a year after the apology.\nGareau, who is M\u00e9tis and from the Batoche Homeland in Saskatchewan, says he felt \"gobsmacked\" watching Francis participating in the Lac Ste. Anne pilgrimage wearing a red M\u00e9tis\u00a0sash around his neck.\nIn the historic relationship between Catholics and Indigenous people, Gareau says the church has acted \"like bad relatives,\"\u00a0making betrayals even more devastating.\n\"The church has to take a reflection on how to be a good relative,\" he says.\nOttawa spent less than half the cash pledged to Indigenous communities for papal visit by journey's end\nMounties spent nearly $14M to protect Pope Francis during historic visit\nFrancis said in his apology that the largest evil is indifference, so now it is up to the Catholic institution to work on\u00a0dismantling 400 years of a colonial mindset toward Indigenous Peoples, Gareau says.\nGareau pointed to Vatican II, which significantly modernized church practices to meet cultural shifts in the early 1960s. Not\u00a0everyone immediately embraced the structural changes, but it eventually revolutionized the church.\nFrancis has steered the ship in a direction toward reconciliation, Gareau says. But the church must now recognize Indigenous sovereignty, and that means engaging in diplomatic\u00a0relations and returning land.\nIt also means changing the hearts and mind of Catholics and dismantling anti-Indigenous structural racism \u2014\u00a0work that cannot and\u00a0should not rely on Indigenous people.\n\"There's so much at stake.\"\nA national Indian Residential School Crisis Line is available to provide support for survivors and those affected. People can access emotional and crisis referral services by calling the 24-hour service at 1-866-925-4419.\nMental health counselling and crisis support is also available 24 hours a day, seven days a week through the Hope for Wellness hotline at 1-855-242-3310 or \nby online chat\n.",

They got heavier.\"\nDumond said the size of the bearing cartridge stayed the same, which may have lead to more force being exerted.\nA damaged cartridge assembly is seen after a light rail train derailed in Ottawa in August 2021.\n \n(Transportation Safety Board)\nRoot cause analysis coming soon\nHeavy loads, similar to the crowds leaving Bluesfest, have been tested in recent weeks to see if they're causing\u00a0the unusual wear-and-tear.\nRichard Holder, the city's director of engineering services, said\u00a0none of the tests found conditions for\u00a0\"instantaneous failure\" but suggested reliability may drop\u00a0with \"repetitive loads.\"\nRichard Holder is the City of Ottawa's director of engineering services. He says tests to ensure the safety of the LRT are ongoing.\n \n(Kate Porter/CBC)\nIt's like a twist tie being bent and straightened over and over until it eventually breaks, Dumond explained.\nWhile Dumond has no access to specific data, he said redesigning the wheel hub assembly makes sense.\nStrengthening\u00a0it by using better materials\u00a0\u2014 as RTG and Alstom appear ready to do with their new axle hub assemblies\u00a0\u2014 will allow the\u00a0system to\u00a0withstand more force.\nAnother issue\u00a0raised\u00a0in the LRT inquiry was\u00a0the side-to-side force exerted on the wheel bearings as a train\u00a0pushes around corners at high speed.\n\"If you're coming into a corner with a train that's way heavier than it should be,\u00a0that first rail that comes into the corner,\" Dumond said,\u00a0\"you can imagine that you're putting almost all of that extra load onto that one wheel.\"\nThe city has also looked at potential track issues, adjusting restraining rails built to prevent derailments and adding lubrication to the top of the rails around the tightest curves.\nAxle bearings on Ottawa LRT might need to be redesigned\nLRT inquiry commissioner still concerned about wheel and track problems\nHolder said the root cause analysis of the 2021 derailment should be released within the next few months, but teams\u00a0are working on recommendations from the Transportation Safety Board and the National Research Council, \nwhich RTG hired to look into it\n.\n\"Based on their experience and everything they've seen, they have a very good idea of what the problem is now,\" he said, further extending the city's medical analogy. \"They're just waiting for the blood work to come back.\"\nWho pays for the fix?\nThe city plans to gradually resume service starting next Monday, but Amilcar said that timeline is\u00a0contingent on the completed inspection of all bearings in the fleet, the French manufacturer's\u00a0analysis of the failed hub assembly and a safety plan from Alstom and RTG.\n\"They're working on a redesign that will bring a final fix,\" Amilcar said. \"In the meantime, for sure, we will need to continue to improve the current system to ensure we can safely continue to use the [light rail vehicles] as we have them now.\"\nSpecific plans to bolster\u00a0maintenance will come in the next few days.\nIn the meantime, frustrated commuters will continue to rely on a replacement bus service that often lengthens their commute. The added service also relies on paying overtime to drivers.\nWATCH | Who pays for what during this LRT shutdown?\nWho pays for what during this LRT shutdown?\n19 hours ago\nDuration \n0:59\nTransit commission chair Glen Gower said the city is on the hook for extra personnel and overtime needed to operate R1 buses, while RTG and Alstom will take on the cost of finding and fixing the root cause.\nBut Gower said as long as\u00a0the train is not running, the city will not have to pay the \"millions of dollars per month\" it usually provides to RTG for a functioning LRT.\nThe testing and the fix itself, meanwhile, will be fully covered by RTG and Alstom.\n\"I believe that one day we will have a safe, reliable light rail service for the people of Ottawa, for the passengers of OC Transpo, for the people who rely on public transit,\" Sutcliffe said.\n\"This work is bringing us closer to that day.\"",

But it was a time consuming, emotionally, financially draining process,\" he said.\u00a0\"We feel it was worth it.\"\nStatus revoked for promoting 'hate and intolerance': CRA\nIn 2018, \nthe CRA told CBC News\n it revoked the mosque's charitable status because the organization failed to devote all its resources to charity and \"allowed its resources to be used for activities that promote hate and intolerance,\" causing it to fail the CRA's public benefit test.\u00a0\nAt the time, the CRA said its decision rested in part on the fact that four controversial speakers, some of whom had made derogatory comments about women, Jewish and LGBTQ people\u00a0had appeared at the mosque multiple times between 2009 and 2014.\nIn 2018, a spokesperson for the mosque said they felt the CRA's decision to revoke its status was unfair given it was based on things someone had said somewhere other than the mosque.\nWhen asked if any of those speakers had appeared at the mosque since, Moalimishak wouldn't elaborate but said the mosque has and will continue to reject divisive speakers and its values reflect the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\u00a0 \nWith its charitable status restored, this mosque can continue its good work, president says\n19 hours ago\nDuration \n0:51\nAbdulhakim Moalimishak, president of the Ottawa Islamic Centre and Assalam Mosque, said the past five years without charitable status have been hard and he's excited for the future now that it has been returned.\n\"We condemn any type of hate, political, religious or otherwise. We condemn any type of judgmental or biased understanding of theology,\" he said.\nThe CRA wouldn't elaborate on why it had reversed its decision about the mosque due to confidentiality provisions in the Income Tax Act.\nBut in an emailed statement, a spokesperson said the agency \"is dedicated to diversity, inclusion and anti-racism, in alignment with its values of professionalism, integrity, respect and collaboration, and assesses all concerns about charities against a clear regulatory and risk framework.\"\n\"Where those assessments give rise to further concerns, the CRA will look into them in line with its standard processes.\"\nLooking ahead to the future\nMoalimishak characterized the years without charitable status and the appeals process as a \"roller-coaster.\"\u00a0\nHe said the mosque relies on its charitable status to fundraise and it was hard not to be able to give charitable receipts to its congregation.\u00a0\n\"Words cannot describe the amount of, you know, difficulty that we encountered\u00a0not having a charitable status,\" he said.\u00a0\nNow the mosque is once again considered a charity, Moalimishak is hopeful it will continue to have a positive relationship with the CRA and he's excited about the possibilities moving forward.\u00a0\n\"I would say that the relationship with the CRA today is what inspires me to keep going and not to look back on all the suffering and negativity.\"",

        "content": "WARNING: This story includes distressing details.\nBefore the sun broke through the sky Monday morning, members of a Manitoba First Nation planned to start a month-long search in a good way.\nSpiritual advisers were to lead a pipe ceremony in Minegoziibe Anishinabe while a sacred fire was to be lit near where there may be graves of children who were forced to attend residential school.\nThe sacred fire is expected to burn for the entirety of the estimated four-week-long excavation of an area underneath the Catholic church where 14 anomalies were detected using ground-penetrating radar last year.\n\"This allows for a trauma-informed, spiritually and culturally sensitive approach to the work that we have to do in the community,\" Chief Derek Nepinak said before the ceremony.\nMonday is about ensuring elders, survivors and intergenerational survivors of the former Pine Creek Residential School are provided support before ground is expected to be broken Tuesday.\nPotential unmarked graves investigation finds no evidence so far of criminal activity: Manitoba RCMP\nThe First Nation, northwest of Winnipeg, is working with archeologists and scientists from Brandon University to conduct the search. Nepinak said it's the same team that assists police when archeological digs and excavations are conducted in the province.\nBefore the excavation can start, the team has to \"stage an area\" where the dig will take place and where materials will be transported.\n\"It is a very meticulous and focused approach that they're using,\" said Nepinak.\nHe believes Minegoziibe Anishinabe is one of the first communities in Canada to begin excavating after detecting possible unmarked graves at former residential school sites.\nAn estimated 150,000 Indigenous children were forced to attend residential schools. More than 60 per cent of the schools were run by the Catholic Church.\nSurvivors of the schools have been speaking out for decades about the possibility of unmarked graves at the sites, prompting the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to release a report on missing children and unmarked burials in 2016.\nWestern Manitoba First Nation set to start search of church site for potential unmarked graves\nBut it wasn't until Tk'emlups te Secwepemc released its findings of what is believed to be 215 unmarked burials at the former Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia in 2021 that the country and the world took notice.\nThe federal government appointed Kimberly Murray as a special interlocutor on unmarked graves and committed to funding search efforts.\nMurray's interim report last month outlined more than a dozen other First Nations that have begun ground searches, including one in Star Blanket Cree Nation in Saskatchewan where the partial remains of a child aged four to six were recovered.\nSome communities are still grappling with next steps in their search, with some elders expressing concerns about disturbing the ground where a child might\u00a0lay in rest.\nAn investigation found 14 points of concern underneath the Catholic church in the community last year using ground-penetrating radar. AltoMaxx staff are seen using a drone in May 2022 as part of the search.\n \n(Angela McKay/Pine Creek First Nation)\nNepinak said his community hosted multiple engagement sessions and questions came up that he and councillors were unable to answer.\nAs conversations continued, it became clear survivors needed to know the full truth of what happened.\n\"We hope that this process will bring some closure to some long-standing questions that people might have about what went on in our homeland and in our territory,\" said Nepinak.\nThe Pine Creek school was run by the Roman Catholic Church and operated from 1890 to 1969 in different buildings, including the church, on a large plot of land.\nThe National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation has a record of 21 child deaths at the school, and survivors have long spoken about the abuse there.\nThe community's initial search also found 57 additional anomalies found on the grounds around the church and old school site, but the First Nation is focusing its search on the church basement.\n\"Any human remains that are buried under the church don't belong buried under a church in our homelands,\" said Nepinak.\n\"We're doing this out of respect for human life and the dignity that humans are owed in their lifetime.\"\nMinegoziibe Anishinabe has also been calling on the RCMP to investigate.\nRCMP investigate after search of western Manitoba residential school site discovers possible unmarked graves\nMounties started an investigation last year with the aim of looking into any criminal activity that may be related to the 14 points of interest the community detected.\nPolice said Friday that investigators were unable to uncover any evidence suggesting something criminal occurred.\nThey added officers would investigate anything potentially criminal that turns up in the dig.\nIf any remains are found, the community will work with the coroner's office on next steps, which may include DNA testing.\nWhatever happens, Nepinak hopes the search will provide his nation with the \"opportunity to heal and move forward in a better and stronger way.\"\nA national Indian Residential School Crisis Line is available to provide support for survivors and those affected. People can access emotional and crisis referral services by calling the 24-hour service at 1-866-925-4419.\nMental health counselling and crisis support is also available 24 hours a day, seven days a week through the Hope for Wellness hotline at 1-855-242-3310 or \nby online chat\n.",

Police previously said they are investigating the fire as a homicide.\nFire crews responded to reports of another blaze at the home shortly before 10 p.m. on Saturday\u00a0and declared it under control about half an hour later, a Sunday news release from the city said.\nNo one was found inside and no injuries were reported after the Saturday fire, according to city.\nThe Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service determined that the house's structural integrity was \"compromised\" and ordered an emergency demolition that took place on Sunday morning, the city said.\nOne man died after a house fire on 689 Furby Street last June, which is pictured prior to its Sunday demolition. The homicide unit is investigating the cause behind the blaze, according to police.\n \n(Joanne Roberts/CBC)\nCity crews spent about half an hour demolishing what remained of it on Sunday morning, according to\u00a0Rupesh Mongha, who lives two doors down.\nHe says the house was originally occupied before the fatal fire, but had ongoing problems with trespassers in the area afterwards, so he's glad to see it gone.\n\"People are coming and going,\" Mongha told CBC News on Sunday.\u00a0\"They come and go in our house also. They don't value the boundary and all that.\"\nThe house right next door to him is also now vacant after a February fire, but he said it was vacant before the fire and attracted trespassers as well.\u00a0\nWinnipeg house fire leaves one dead, two brought to hospital\nMongha wants to see more community and foot patrols in the area. He says he's had to call the police many times about trespassers in nearby vacant homes, but they take a long time to respond if they come at all.\n\"It's just like a normal thing here.\"\nPolice previously said the homicide unit is investigating the cause behind the June fire at 689 Furby Street.\nThey're asking anyone with information about the incident, or the events leading up to it, to call investigators at 204-986-6508. Anonymous tips can also be left with Crime Stoppers at 204-786-8477 (TIPS).\n \n The cause of Saturday's fire is still under investigation.",

He\u00a0is trying to find the balance between keeping\u00a0Manitobans on the union's side while increasing the pressure on the province.\nWorkers at retail Liquor Marts will walk out on Wednesday and Thursday.\n \n(Angela Johnston/CBC)\nMost Liquor Marts were closed on Wednesday, when\u00a0workers held a one-day walkout. Only a\u00a0handful of locations in Winnipeg and Brandon stayed open as management filled the positions.\nDistribution centre staff walked the picket lines for a few days last week.\u00a0That includes staff working in the warehouse and those performing office functions related to specialty wine stores, the cannabis division, supply chain management, licensee sales and marketing, MGEU said.\nThe 1,400 workers have been without a contract since the previous one expired in March 2022. The bargaining teams have been meeting regularly since then, but Ross said the union's team continues to be\u00a0told \"this is all we can offer.\"\nUnion says 3.3% is\u00a0fair\nLiquor & Lotteries has presented a four-year contract with a two per cent wage increase in each year,\u00a0with additional bumps to ensure those at the bottom end of the pay scale get legislated minimum wage increases.\nOn Monday, Ross said 3.3 per cent would be a fair offer as it is tied to the consumer price index. Premier Heather Stefanson and other elected officials will receive exactly that\u00a0this year and another 3.6 per cent in 2024, he pointed out.\n\"If it's good enough for her, it's good enough for us,\" Ross said at his news conference Monday at Memorial Park in front of the legislative building.\nHe accused Stefanson of tying the hands of the Liquor & Lotteries\u00a0bargaining committee.\n\"What is clear\u00a0is that Heather Stefanson and cabinet are calling the shots here. It is very clear that the Stefanson government is imposing restrictive wage mandates on employers across the public sector,\" Ross said.\n\"This provincial wage mandate is not just out of touch with realities facing Manitoba workers, who are trying to make ends meet while inflation soars, but it's not aligned with the going trend.\"\nWorkers at Manitoba-owned liquor distribution centres to remain on strike into Thursday\nStrike action continues for Manitoba liquor distribution centre workers\nIn January, Statistics Canada's\u00a0labour report showed average hourly\u00a0wages\u00a0were up 5.1 per cent in December over the previous year.\nThe government has said it is not involved in the bargaining, and that it is solely between the MGEU and Liquor & Lotteries.\nRoss challenged that.\n\"The provincial government sets the wage mandate for public sector bargaining \u2026 [and it is]\u00a0imposing a wage mandate that is out of touch with reality.\"\nManitoba Liquor & Lotteries earns hundreds of millions of dollars in profits every year, Ross pointed out.\n\"The corporation can afford fair and reasonable wages for its dedicated employees.\u00a0Until then, we will continue to bargain and continue to strike,\" he said.\nThe Crown corporation responded to the union in an emailed statement, saying their monetary\u00a0offer includes more than just a two per cent wage increase, but also\u00a0\"increases to starting wages and other pay scale adjustments to address increases to Manitoba's minimum wage and other impactful improvements for all staff.\"\nIt also said the union's strike actions could negatively\u00a0impact the summer festival season and hospitality industry.",

        "summary": "Organizers of the 2023 World Police and Fire Games have lowered their expectations for the number of athletes who will participate in the athletic tournament\u00a0slated to begin Friday in Winnipeg.",
        "content": "Organizers of the 2023 World Police and Fire Games have lowered their expectations for the number of athletes who will participate in the athletic tournament\u00a0slated to begin Friday in Winnipeg.\nOne year ago, the games\u00a0expected 8,500 athletes to participate in the 10-day event, not including their friends and family members.\nOrganizers are still sticking with the 8,500-participant figure\u00a0\u2014 but are now including officials, friends and family in that tally.\n\"We will hit that number,\" chief operating officer Mike Edwards said Monday in an interview, declining to state how many athletes alone will participate at the games.\n\"I don't know yet just because registration is still open. So until we have that closed, which can happen for some sports all the way up until the end, I don't want to provide anything that is inaccurate at this time.\"\nWinnipeg organizers tout Olympic-style event for 8,500 police, firefighters coming a year from now\nTo date, the largest athletic tournament ever held in Winnipeg was the 1999 Pan American Games. That 17-day event saw 5,083 athletes from the western hemisphere participate in 34 sports, most of which were also Olympic events.\nThe 2023 World Police\u00a0and Fire Games will feature 63 different sports, made up of a mix of common sports and less conventional competitions such as\u00a0a stair race,\u00a0a beanbag game called cornhole\u00a0and an event called TCA, or \"toughest competitor alive.\"\nEvents adjusted for\u00a0fewer teams\nEdwards said participation is expected to be stronger for individual events than it will be for some team events, explaining it is difficult for emergency responders who play as a team to be able to get holiday time simultaneously.\n\"To take an entire hockey team or the baseball team from one service does pose\u00a0challenges, so the athletes have just been redirecting themselves to sports that allow them to make it easier to register,\" he said.\nNo events have been cancelled, but some,\u00a0he said, have been adjusted to accommodate fewer teams.\nIn 1999, athletes from 42 countries participated in Winnipeg's Pan Am Games. Edwards said athletes from 70 countries will take part in the World Police and Fire Games, but would not disclose the identity of those nations.\n\"We don't provide that list just because it's ever growing and changing,\" he said, promising to\u00a0list the countries after the games are completed.\n\"When it comes to privacy acts from other countries that we are bound by as an international organization, we have to go with the most strict and right now, that is where we are at.\"\nWinnipeg to host 2023 World Police and Fire Games\nHotels in Winnipeg are most looking forward to the international participants, as they'll make the largest financial impact on the hospitality industry, said Michael Juce, president and CEO of the Manitoba Hotel Association.\nNonetheless, he said it will take several months to discern the precise effect of the games on hotel occupancy.\nThe hotel sector\u00a0in Winnipeg was already doing well this year because of what he described as an\u00a0unfortunate windfall: An uptick in short stays by newly landed refugees from the war in Ukraine.\nGames free for spectators\nAttendance at\u00a0\nall competitions at the 2023 World Police and Fire Games\n is free. Organizers are also inviting the public to observe an athletes' parade that starts at 6:30 p.m. on Friday at True North Square and proceeds along Carlton Street.\nThe games are also holding a nightly \"athletes' village\" at the CN Stage at The Forks, but attendance at this gathering is restricted to athletes, officials and registered friends and family.\n\"It's really the place where the camaraderie of the first responders comes together,\" Edwards said. \"It's the central meeting point, especially outside of competition, for all athletes and accredited family and friends.\"\nPosters calling for the cancellation of the games appeared this spring on some downtown light standards.\n \n(Bartley Kives/CBC)\nA space outside every event, including the athletes' village, will be set aside for\u00a0protesters, he said.\n\"We want to ensure that everybody has the opportunity to have their freedom of expression rights enabled and that we're not hindering that in any way,\" said Edwards, adding athletes should not be hindered\u00a0as well.\n\"There's obviously a level of respect and consideration for these high-performing athletes in an athletic competition. You know, first and foremost, we are an athletic organization and so we want to make sure that the integrity of sport and the integrity of the athletic competition is maintained.\"\nMontreal cancels 2017 World Police and Fire Games\nA small group of protesters chanted and booed one year ago when games organizers held a news conference at True North Square. In recent months, posters have appeared on some light standards in downtown Winnipeg\u00a0urging the city to cancel the games.",

Dani McKinnon\u00a0told CBC News in an email.\nThe Crown prosecution service \"confirms it will review any new evidence,\" a provincial spokesperson said in an email to CBC, but said the province can't provide any further comment at this point.\nNo charges laid\nPolice had previously investigated the death but charges were never laid.\nFor years, Jim Garwood has wanted the police investigation\u00a0reopened. Police declined, despite a civil court decision in October 2022 that found the death was not accidental.\nIn a lawsuit filed in 2019, Garwood sought to hold his former step-daughter, Catherine Johnson, responsible for his mother's death.\nIn October 2022, Manitoba Court of King's Bench Justice Theodor Bock made a judgment in Garwood's favour and awarded him monetary damages.\nCivil court ruling prompts call to reopen police investigation into 2004 death of 87-year-old Winnipeg woman\nCrime or accident? Winnipeg man sues former family member over death of 87-year-old mother\nThe lawsuit claimed Johnson was the person who discovered Jessie Garwood's body in the basement of the house, and that the senior had died of blunt force head trauma.\u00a0\nShe suffered lacerations and abrasions on the front, back, and both sides of her head, as well as broken ribs, a fractured arm, and wounds to the back of her hands, according to the lawsuit.\nThe civil lawsuit alleged Johnson caused Jessie's death by either pushing her down the stairs or physically assaulting her.\nJohnson did not appear in court at the civil trial but she filed a statement of defence saying she \"had nothing to do with\" the death.\nA civil lawsuit Garwood launched in 2019 alleged his mother's death was the result of either being pushed down the stairs or physically assaulted. 'I think it'll be a bit of a uphill climb trying to get any of the Crown prosecutors \u2026 or the police to do the right thing' by reviewing the case, he says.\n \n(Tyson Koschik/CBC)\nAfter the civil court decision, Younes followed up on a request by Garwood to review the case.\u00a0\nIn an email to CBC on Friday, Younes said that prompted him to review \"our entire investigative file on this case, as well as to review the findings of the various forensic consultants Mr. Garwood has retained over the years.\"\nYounes said he was previously unaware of some of the findings, but always had some concerns about the autopsy findings, which\u00a0\u2014 in combination with the additional information provided by Garwood \u2014 led him to reclassify the death.\nAny action that would be taken by police or the Crown as a result of that change \"is entirely up to them,\" said Younes.\nIt's not rare\u00a0for\u00a0a death to be reclassified, the chief medical examiner said.\n\"The manner of death is not set in stone, and is always subject to change if new information concerning the case becomes available,\" said Younes.\nThe fact Jessie's death has been reclassified twice \"is a reflection of the continued efforts of Mr. Garwood to bring new evidence to light.\"\nGarwood said he wants both the police and the Crown to now review the case.\nHowever, \"I think it'll be a bit of an uphill climb trying to get any of the Crown prosecutors \u2026 or the police to do the right thing,\" he said.\u00a0\nDeath reclassified as homicide after almost 20 years\n1 day ago\nDuration \n2:47\nThe body of 87-year-old Jessie Garwood was discovered with extensive injuries in 2004 in the basement of her Winnipeg home, where she lived alone.

What we need to do is to make physicians who come here feel welcome and supported in the environments in which they're going,\" Ziomek said at the news conference.\nTentative deal with doctors aims to address physician shortage, retention issues in Manitoba\nManitoba wants 150 new family doctors for the province, and recruitment specialists to find them\nA spokesperson for Shared Health, which issued the request for proposals for the initiative, said the time commitment required to stay in a specific role or community would be \"subject to negotiated contractual terms agreed to between the physician and health system employer.\"\nThe contract with Canadian Health Labs is for two years, with an option for a third year, the spokesperson said in an email.\nThe number of doctors recruited per geographic area also affects the overall compensation, with more incentives given for filling positions in rural and northern areas that are typically harder to fill.\nThe initiative comes in response to Manitoba's continuing shortage of doctors.\nA\u00a0\nreport released late last year by the Canadian Institute for Health Information\n\u00a0said the province has 217 physicians per 100,000 residents \u2014 the third-lowest rate in the country, ahead of\u00a0only Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island.\nRequirements eased\nManitoba has also \napproved new amendments to streamline registration requirements\n and speed up the process for internationally educated physicians, which will come into effect on Sept. 1, Gordon said.\u00a0\nThose changes mean internationally educated physicians will no longer have to hold a licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada to practise in Manitoba, as along as they meet all the other registration requirements, Gordon said.\nDr. Anna Ziomek, registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba, says the latest changes to the province's registration requirements will help reduce barriers for internationally educated physicians.\n \n(Justin Fraser/CBC)\nSpecialists who have already completed the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada's subspecialist examination affiliate program will also now be eligible for a new fast-tracked registration process more appropriate for their qualifications.\n\"Our government is healing health care by bringing more doctors into the province, making it easier for internationally educated doctors to practise in Manitoba and working to retain those that are currently providing care to Manitobans,\" Gordon said.\nZiomek said the changes, which come following public consultations that got largely supportive feedback, will reduce barriers for internationally educated medical graduates while maintaining public safety.\n\"These changes make Manitoba more attractive to highly skilled professionals who will make valuable contributions to our health-care system,\" she said.\u00a0\nGordon said specialists and family physicians will still have to demonstrate competency by either completing the Manitoba Practice Assessment Program or completing post-graduate medical education and getting certification from the College of Family Physicians of Canada or the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada.\nBrandon Clinic closes walk-in services due to physician burnout and inadequate staffing: CEO\n900 health-care workers hired in the last 6 months, Manitoba government says\nThe changes also allow the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba to establish streamlined assessment requirements for fully licensed and internationally educated doctors, including reducing provincial registration requirements for applicants from areas with similar health care, education and training systems.\u00a0\nThose regions include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, Gordon said. The change will align Manitoba's requirements with other regulatory bodies in Canada, she said.\nThe update comes days after the province announced it had reached a tentative deal with Doctors Manitoba that includes \na $268-million funding boost\n\u00a0for doctors and initiatives to address physician shortage and retention issues over the next four years.\nDr. Michael Boroditsky, president of Doctors Manitoba, in Monday's news release lauded the latest regulatory changes, which he said \"will remove burdensome and unnecessary steps\" to getting a licence in the province.\u00a0\nThe changes also come a few months after the province approved other amendments that \nremoved the need for internationally educated doctors to pass\n the Medical Council of Canada qualifying exam Part 1 before registering and practising in Manitoba.",

The church sits beside the former Pine Creek Residential School.\nNation member Brenda Catcheway has been part of the search for unmarked graves since it first began. She says the search is part of the story of Minegoziibe Anishinabe, located about 320\u00a0kilometres northwest of Winnipeg, because the residential school left traumas that have lasted generations.\n\"I'm just happy with the stage that we are at and happy that I'm going to be here to complete it,\" Catcheway said.\u00a0\nGround-penetrating radar detected 14 anomalies in Our Lady of Seven Sorrows basement.\n \n(Chelsea Kemp/CBC)\nShe was at the church grounds Monday providing a community update on the ongoing search.

On July 13, Armando De Dios-Carrillo received a two-year sentence, and Victor Manuel Perez-Aguilera was sentenced to 18 months.\nAll three men pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to transport people into the U.S. illegally.\nProsecutors say the conspiracy involved smuggling a group of people from Mexico across the border from Canada into North Dakota in March, with plans to eventually move them to other U.S. locations. In exchange, the smugglers would be paid thousands of dollars by each person.\nAuthorities said the plan fell apart when a pickup truck carrying the people got stuck in the snow. The truck was towed and later seen by U.S. Border Patrol agents at a hotel in Langdon, N.D., where the smugglers and some of the people they brought into the U.S. were staying, according to prosecutors.\nLangdon is 27 kilometres south of the international border between North Dakota and Manitoba.",

These include lithium, graphite, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements, which are the six minerals recognized as having the greatest opportunity for economic growth, a news release from the province said.\u00a0\n\"This strategy tells the world that Manitoba is open for business,\" she said.\u00a0\nStefanson added the increased focus on critical minerals will lead to more jobs in every corner of the province.\nJeff Wharton, the province's economic development, investment and trade minister, echoed the premier's sentiment and said Manitoba is positioned as a hub for critical minerals.\u00a0\n\"This strategy will help get mines into production, creating good paying jobs for Manitoba families and generating the revenues we need for the essential services and infrastructure Manitobans rely on every day,\" he said.\u00a0 \nManitoba Premier Heather Stefanson speaks with Robin Dunbar, CEO and president  of Grid Metals and Daymon Guillas, the president president of PADCOM, the Potash and Agri Development Corporation of Manitoba.\n \n(Ian Froese/CBC )\n'Economic reconciliation' included\nOne of the pillars of the strategy recognized in Tuesday's\u00a0news conference is advancing Indigenous-involved partnerships.\u00a0 \nAs part of the strategy, a mining advisory leadership group\u00a0will be established with Indigenous representatives. The goal is to strengthen relationships, explore revenue sharing and establish a community capacity-building fund, the province's news release said.\u00a0\nWharton pointed to the Potash and Agri Development Corporation of Manitoba, which\u00a0recently started production on Manitoba's first-ever potash mine with Gambler First Nation\u00a0holding\u00a020 per cent equity in the project. He also mentioned an agreement between Marcel Colomb First Nation and Alamos Gold Inc.\u00a0which will see the First Nation and mining company share revenues while collaborating on economic development, jobs, training and environmental stewardship of a gold-mining project.\nWharton also said there are currently over 20 exploration agreements between First Nations and the mining industry.\u00a0\nProduction begins at Manitoba's 1st potash mine\nNorthern Manitoba First Nation says deal with mining company Alamos is golden opportunity\nAlso included in parts of the strategy is the establishment of a new fund to support critical mining work by post-secondary institutions in Manitoba and the improvement of the provincial tax credit.\u00a0\nEconomic Development, Investment and Trade Minister Jeff Wharton said Tuesday the particular sector hasn't been front and centre in the province for decades. \n \n(Darin Morash/CBC)\nNDP respond to premier\u00a0\nStefanson said Tuesday the vision of Wab Kinew and the opposition NDP would \"kill jobs for thousands of Manitobans,\" citing Kinew's signing of the Leap Manifesto around a decade ago\u00a0which, among other things, calls for no new infrastructure projects aimed at increasing extraction of non-renewable resources.\nThe NDP responded with a statement\u00a0Tuesday afternoon and said that since 2017, three mines in the province have closed,\u00a0the Progressive Conservatives cut the mining reserve fund and Manitoba has lost 1,700 mining jobs.\nThe party has also pledged to \nboost mining development\n if elected this fall.\u00a0\nNDP leader aims to boost critical mineral development if he becomes Manitoba's next premier\nThe full critical mining strategy can be found \non the province's website.\n The province also said Tuesday the strategy will be followed up by the Manitoba minerals action plan, which will outline\u00a0specific actions to achieve Manitoba's mineral sector potential, a news release said.\u00a0\nThe action plan will\u00a0evaluate progress\u00a0and is expected to be released next spring.\u00a0\n\"That's what this is all about \u2014 opening Manitoba for business, while being smart stewards of the land that we call our home,\" said Stefanson.\u00a0",

        "summary": "Lawyers for a former Manitoba doctor accused of sexually assaulting his patients presented their closing arguments in court Tuesday, maintaining that he was performing medical exams in a proper way.\u00a0",
        "content": "WARNING: This article contains graphic content and may affect those who have experienced\u200b \u200b\u200b\u200bsexual violence or know someone affected by it.\nLawyers for a former Manitoba doctor accused of sexually assaulting his patients presented their closing arguments in court Tuesday, maintaining he was performing medical exams in a proper way.\u00a0\nBut the Crown challenged that assertion, pointing to expert testimony that suggests the exams he performed were uncommon for a family doctor, and that the way he did them was unnecessary.\u00a0\nArcel Bissonnette is accused of assaulting female patients when he worked in Ste. Anne, southeast of Winnipeg, between 2004 and 2017.\nHe was initially charged in 2020 with six counts of sexual assault. After those charges were announced, more complainants came forward, and 16 more counts were added in October 2021.\nA judge-only trial before Court of King's Justice Sadie Bond was held in May on five of the 22 counts, after a sixth charge was stayed.\u00a0\nDuring the trial, the court heard testimony from five of Bissonnette's former patients, as well as a family doctor and a doctor who specializes in gynecological cancers who testified as expert witnesses.\u00a0\nThe women testified that Bissonnette performed vaginal, rectal and/or breast exams on them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable, seemed sexual in nature and that they did not consent to.\u00a0 \nSome witnesses also testified they observed Bissonnette had an erection afterward.\u00a0\nWoman needed therapy after 'disgusting' examination by doctor, sex assault trial told\nWoman testifies about 'embarrassing, shocking and uncomfortable' vaginal exam by former doctor\nOn Tuesday, defence lawyer Josh Weinstein argued that the Crown failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the touching was sexual in nature, or that the complainants didn't consent to the medical exams.\u00a0\nHe said any touching Bissonnette did was done in a medically appropriate way to be thorough and check for abnormalities. He pointed out that his client testified that he found nothing \"erotic or sexual\" about it.\u00a0\n\"Dr. Bissonnette should leave this courtroom the same way he entered, with the presumption of innocence.\"\nEarlier in the day, Weinstein's co-defence counsel Lisa LaBossiere noted several inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony, such as differences between what they told police versus what they testified in court.\u00a0\nBissonnette sat in the front row of the courtroom just behind his lawyers Tuesday, quietly taking notes while sitting with a female companion.\u00a0\nCrown's case\nCrown prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere pointed out that during the trial, medical experts testified that some of the exams Bissonnette performed on the complainant were not common for a family physician to do.\u00a0\nShe said one of the experts testified that one of the exams in particular, the bimanual pelvic, is not typically used as part of routine screening and that there was no medical reason to repeatedly insert and remove fingers into a patient's vagina.\u00a0\nAnother medical expert was a family doctor who testified she never did the exam as part of her practice at all, Lagimodiere told the court.\u00a0\nOn the issue of consent, Lagimodiere said the first witness in the trial told the court that while she assumed her physical would involve a pelvic exam, Bissonnette did not tell her what he was going to do before he inserted his fingers into her vagina.\u00a0\n\"There is no medical reason to do it that way,\" she said.\u00a0\nLagimodiere also called Bissonnette's credibility into question, telling the court that he relied mostly on his notes which were inconsistent and/or lacking detail.\u00a0\n6 sexual assault charges against rural Manitoba doctor stayed\nDoctor charged with sexually assaulting patients last year now faces 16 more charges, police say\nShe also argued that the accused often referred to how a procedure would generally be done, whereas the complainants testified to their own experiences.\nThe matter was adjourned to Wednesday afternoon, where the Crown will wrap up its submissions.\u00a0\nBissonnette is set for another trial in February 2024 on the remaining 10 counts.\u00a0\nA trial on the original six charges was held in January 2023, but the Crown entered a stay of proceedings, saying the likelihood of conviction had changed after new evidence came to light.\u00a0\nSupport is available for anyone who has been sexually assaulted. You can access crisis lines and local support services through this\u00a0\nGovernment of Canada website\n\u00a0or the\u00a0\nEnding Violence Association of Canada database\n. \u200b\u200bIf you're in immediate danger or fear for your safety or that of others around you, please call 911.",

        "content": "Impaired Manitoba drivers involved in collisions will soon foot the bill for damages caused to other vehicles and property, the province announced at a Tuesday press conference.\nStarting in August, drivers who get into an accident while under the influence will be unable to receive third-party liability coverage from Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI).\nJustice Minister Kelvin Goertzen said the majority of Manitoba drivers who follow the law \"should not be financially responsible for the consequences of those who don't.\"\u00a0\nThe new rules will affect impaired drivers of all motor vehicles, including off-road vehicles.\nBetween 2016 and 2022, MPI data shows a quarter of fatal collisions in Manitoba involved an impaired driver, causing an average of 26 deaths per year and seven so far in 2023.\nMPI loses another exec but board chair insists Crown corp has handle on spending, restructuring\nInternal review led to ouster of Manitoba Public Insurance CEO, board chair says\n\"These numbers are not just statistics. They represent families torn apart, dreams shattered and futures forever changed,\" Trevor Ens, president of MADD Canada's Winnipeg chapter, said Tuesday.\n\"It is essential to remember that behind these changes are real people.\"\nImpaired driving persists in Manitoba: MPI\nMPI will continue to pay repair costs incurred by impaired drivers but will seek reimbursement from them, board chairman Ward Keith said. Impaired drivers involved in collisions are already denied MPI coverage for damages to their own vehicles.\nA criminal conviction or roadside prohibition is needed to enact the new penalty against impaired Manitoba drivers, he said. Those involved in a collision across Canada and the U.S. are still under the province's jurisdiction and liable for all damage costs, including bodily injuries.\n\"Simply put, there is no valid reason for any Manitoban to drive while impaired,\" Keith said Tuesday, adding that impaired driving has declined in Manitoba in recent years but still exists.\nThe regulation change will not affect access to personal injury benefits for Manitoba drivers, but those found under the influence at the time of an accident will continue to receive reduced benefits, he said.\nNDP claims leaked email chain shows MPI's uncertainty about firm consulting on IT renewal project\nManitoba government orders external review of MPI as costs rise\nMPI can refuse to renew drivers licenses as well as vehicle insurance and registration until impaired drivers pay back damages. Those who cannot pay all at once can also arrange to do so over a longer period, according to Keith.\n\"The nice thing about having a public insurance model in Manitoba is our debtors never go very far.\"\nPublic insurers in Saskatchewan and British Columbia currently use the same penalty, and Manitoba is \"now in line with other public insurance environments in Canada,\" he said.\nEns said the new regulation changes are an additional deterrent to make people think twice about getting behind the wheel while under the influence of alcohol or other\u00a0substances.\n\"We must ensure that every person understands the potential consequences of their choices and the impact they have on others.\"\nAnnual financial report released\nMPI's annual financial report, which was also released on Tuesday, shows the public insurer ended the last fiscal year with a $4.2 million surplus.\nKeith said MPI is pleased with that outcome, as the surplus came amid a 2.1 per cent increase in the number of claims reported since the previous fiscal year and\u00a0cost\u00a0about $165\u00a0million more\u00a0overall due to inflation\u00a0and supply chain problems.",

        "content": "A Manitoba woman is still anxiously waiting to learn if her brother was involved in last week's deadly riot at Canada's oldest running federal penitentiary.\n\"It's scary,\" Bernadine Sinclair said. \"My brother \u2014 he's my friend. He's my everything.\"\nA man was killed and seven were injured in a large fight\n involving about 50 inmates at Stony Mountain on the evening of July 17, Mounties said last week.\nSinclair says her 39-year-old brother has been serving time at Stony Mountain Institution just north of Winnipeg since December, but has spent around 15 years total at the prison. CBC News is not identifying Sinclair's brother due to safety concerns.\nSinclair, who lives in Thompson, Man., says family worried for her brother as soon as they learned of the riot, and they're still not sure whether he was hurt.\n2 inmates charged with 1st-degree murder after deadly Manitoba prison riot\nRCMP's\u00a0\nnews releases about the brawl\n included no names of the injured, which sent Sinclair's mind \"all over the place,\" she said.\n\"It's nerve-racking when they go in there, because it gets crazy in there.\"\n'A lot of worried families'\nShe has not spoken to her brother for two months after her phone number changed. She called Stony Mountain to update her phone number on his file last week, but said the person responsible for changing it was not working then.\nRegardless, Stony Mountain should have contacted all family members of all inmates after the riot to provide updates on their safety, she said.\n\"There's a lot of worried families.\"\nBernadine Sinclair says her 39-year-old brother has been serving time at Stony Mountain since December. Her family is still not sure whether he was involved or hurt in the riot.\n \n(Submitted by Bernadine Sinclair)\nIn a statement to CBC News on Monday, Correctional Service of Canada officials said they are required to notify family members of inmates who die while in their custody, but could not provide any further information about the riot as the investigation continues.\nThere were just over 100 inmates in the yard at the time of the brawl, with less than half directly involved, James Bloomfield, the Prairies regional president of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers, previously told CBC News.\nAbout 50 homemade weapons were seized by officers after the incident, Mounties said.\nPrisons mirror communities: criminologist\nMichael Weinrath, a University of Winnipeg criminologist, says prison environments often reflect their surrounding communities.\n\"We have a violent city, province, and homicide is a problem,\" he told CBC News. \"So when we see it inside our prisons, we shouldn't be totally surprised.\"\nPrison gangs, which are often extensions of city street gangs, have a similar willingness to use violence to control the drug trade, maintain turf and sometimes collect debts, said Weinrath.\nThat pursuit for market share can lead to conflict between gangs, causing injuries, fights and killings, he said.\nWeinrath says it's important that Stony Mountain staff react to last week's riot, and the institution can curb future violence by redoubling efforts to keep drugs out and providing more resources to security intelligence to keep track of gangs.\nBut he hopes the institution does not overreact by restricting activities that are important for prisoner rehabilitation.

So we're hoping to suspend the decree and the decision to apply it to students before that happens.\"\nCivil liberties, Muslim groups ask Quebec court to suspend ban on school prayer rooms\nOlga Redko, a lawyer representing the two groups, told a Quebec Court of Appeal judge in Montreal Monday that the decision by the lower court\u00a0didn't properly consider the harm to Muslim students and the urgency of the situation.\n\"The judge himself found that the decree infringes on the affected children's freedom of religion,\" Redko said.

Suspending the ban, she argued, would prevent other students from attending entirely secular schools.\n\"Does the appeal have a chance of success?\" she told the court. \"The answer is no.\"\nStephen Brown, CEO of the NCCM, said the province's ban on overt prayer in school infringes on fundamental religious freedoms and turns religious students into second-class citizens.\n\"The government doesn't get to tell me how to dress, the government shouldn't get to tell me how to eat, the government shouldn't tell you how to pray,\" Brown said, in an interview outside the courthouse.\n\"And just because a couple of people may feel uncomfortable about seeing minorities pray in a way that they're not familiar, it doesn't mean that the government should be able to target children and take away their rights.\"\nJustice Mainville said he expects to deliver a decision later this week.",

The proceeds\u00a0were donated to\u00a0a Montreal-based organization the\n\u00a0Centre d'apprentissage parall\u00e8le\u00a0de Montr\u00e9al \n(CAP)\n\u00a0\nwhich uses art to help\u00a0people dealing with\u00a0mental health challenges.\nOn Sunday, Maquet was adding the finishing touches to his otter carved out of white marble, in line with this\u00a0year's theme: \nWhere two rivers meet\n\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a reference to the intersection of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers.\nA few stations over, Caroline Guay\u00a0was focused on producing a seashell out of Indiana limestone joining herself to the choir of artisans gently tapping hammer against chisel.\u00a0 \n\"I love the noise,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"It's sort of empowering to see how you can mould stone to the way you want it to be.\"\nA carver chips away at a block of limestone during the Canadian Stone Carving Festival in Montreal. Each piece was auctioned off to raise funds for a local Montreal charity. \n \n(Valeria Cori-Manocchio/CBC)\nShe's been practising stone carving\u00a0for 10 years and has participated in the festival eight times. For her, the hobby came naturally since she works as a conservator of heritage buildings in Ottawa.\n\"It's surprising how many people think it's a lost art,\" she said.\nThis Montrealer forged medieval axes used to rebuild Notre-Dame cathedral\nAccording to Maquet, there's been a growing demand for stone carvers especially in heritage conservation. He says he hopes the festival will encourage others to look into the classes offered by his organization.\nBarber says he feels the same way.\n\"It's alive and well and there's room for more people to come [and] try it,\" he said about the craft.\nSunday afternoon, 41 unique sculptures, including one created by members of the public, went up for auction. They all sold, raising\u00a0$10,700 for the CAP, according to Barber.",

Over her almost 30-year career, Campbell said she recalled once being asked by a former federal government about whether there was a way to adjust the language.\n\"I was tasked with finding some words other than 'least restrictive,\"' said Campbell, a lawyer who retired from her role as director-general of the corrections and criminal justice directorate in the Public Safety Department in 2013.\n\"And I actually spent a lot of time perusing dictionaries.\"\nWATCH: Outrage over Paul Bernardo's transfer grows\nOutrage over Paul Bernardo\u2019s transfer to medium security prison\n2 months ago\nDuration \n2:47\nCanada\u2019s prison service is now reviewing its decision to move notorious serial killer and rapist Paul Bernardo from a maximum-security prison to a medium security facility. The transfer has sparked outrage across Canada\u2019s political landscape. Bernardo is serving a life sentence for the murders of Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s.\nCampbell said regardless of the wording that is used, the language speaks to a fundamental and constitutionally protected principle of the justice system that governments cannot escape.\n\"It's on the same level as innocent until proven guilty.\"\nAnne Kelly, the commissioner of the federal correctional service, repeatedly referred to the \"least restrictive\" principle in the review she released of its decision to transfer Bernardo from a maximum-security penitentiary in Ontario to a medium-security prison in Quebec.\nKristen French was 15 and Leslie Mahaffy was 14 when Paul Bernardo savagely kidnapped, tortured and killed them.\n \n(Handout/The Canadian Press)\nBernardo is serving an indeterminate life sentence for the kidnapping, sexual assault and murders of teenagers Kristen French and Leslie Mahaffy in the early 1990s and has been designated a dangerous offender.\nHarper government changed law in 2012\nWhen the Liberal government amended the Correctional and Conditional Release Act in 2019 \u2014 a law created by Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives \u2014 their addition of the term \"least restrictive\" was a reversal of a change made by the Conservative government of former prime minister Stephen Harper.\nBack in 2012, Harper's majority government fulfilled an election promise by passing a crime bill that ushered in a slew of tough-on-crime measures, including mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offences, violent crimes and crimes committed against children.\nCritics of the omnibus bill panned it because they said it was likely to lead to an increase of the prison population and risked filling cells with more Indigenous people and other marginalized Canadians while failing to deliver on a promise to improve public safety \u2014 all at a higher cost to taxpayers.\nWATCH: Corrections Canada says Bernardo's transfer followed the rules\u00a0\nCorrections Canada says rules were followed in Bernardo prison transfer\n5 days ago\nDuration \n3:05\nThe head of the Correctional Service of Canada, which runs the prison system, says the service followed the rules around the prison transfer of Paul Bernardo. The commissioner of the agency said Bernardo met the criteria for the transfer. However, a review committee said more could have been done to notify his victims' families.\nOne of the changes Harper's bill made was to adjust the phrasing of corrections law away from saying officials should use \"the least restrictive measures consistent with the protection of the public, staff members and offenders.\"\nConservatives instead brought in language that said offenders should be kept in prisons with the \"necessary restrictions,\" and federal corrections should use measures \"limited to only what is necessary and proportionate.\"\nThe change followed a review ordered up by the government that concluded prison staff leaned too heavily on the \"least restrictive\" principle, and argued that inmates should instead be made to justify why they should gain privileges.\n\"The wording has been changed slightly over the years,\" Campbell said.\n\"But the wording has never deviated from the fundamental.\"\nLiberal government restored original wording in 2019\nStill, groups like the Canadian Bar Association warned a parliamentary committee at the time that the new phrasing brought in by Harper's government was \"not good enough as a constitutional standard.\"\nHoward Sapers, the then-federal watchdog for corrections, told MPs that the change was concerning, given it was \"one of the golden rules of corrections.\"\nHe said his office relied on the principle to investigate \"some of the most invasive practices in corrections,\" from prisoners being physically restrained and segregated to their security classifications.\nWATCH: Lawyer for victims' families reacts to Bernardo's transfer\nLawyer for French and Mahaffy families reacts to report on Bernardo transfer\n4 days ago\nDuration \n9:07\nTim Danson, counsel for the French and Mahaffy families, is calling for changes to the law that allowed serial killer Paul Bernardo to be transferred to a medium security prison.\nWhen the Liberals revisited the law in 2019 to address the issue of solitary confinement, it restored the original wording, which the bar association welcomed.\nThe lawyers' group said in a brief that some had noticed the shift toward greater prisoner accountability meant in some cases \"requiring that prisoners earn even basic rights and privileges.\"\nThe British Columbia-based Prisoners' Legal Services also applauded the move, saying prisoners were being unnecessarily kept in their cells for up to 23 hours a day.\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks to cameras during a media conference in Toronto, Thursday, July 20, 2023. \n \n(Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)\nSince winning leadership of the Conservative party last fall, Poilievre has ratcheted up its focus on crime, accusing the Liberals of\u00a0being too lenient with offenders at a time when Canadians are anxious about crime.\nHe has seized upon the Bernardo transfer as an example of that.\nLaw changed, but principle has not: expert\nCampbell said although the law's wording has changed over time, the principle at the heart of it has not \u2014 and it did play a role in Bernardo's transfer.\n\"The Conservatives are absolutely right. Of course it contributed to Mr. Bernardo's transfer, because it is a principle that underlies all decisions. Not the only principle, but a fundamental one,\" she said.\n\"That people are not to be subjected to custodial or punitive or controlling measures beyond what is necessary for public safety.\"\nThe La Macaza Institution is located about 200 kilometres northwest of Montreal in the Laurentian Mountains.\n \n(Pascal Robidas/Radio-Canada)\nThe review of Bernardo's transfer decision said that in recent years, more than a dozen reviews stated his behaviour would qualify him for a lesser security classification.\nBut it said the main reason his requests to be moved into a medium-security prison were repeatedly denied was that he had not fully integrated with other inmates at his maximum-security institution. Once that issue was addressed, the transfer went through.\nTim Danson, the lawyer representing the Mahaffy and French families, said the \"least restrictive\" principle is designed to be broadly applied.\nHe argued that \"legislative refinement\" is warranted when it comes to the most dangerous offenders, like Bernardo.",

I have only gratitude that I lived my dream, and excitement for what is next for my family and I. I left everything out there and I'm humbled and honored it was representing this incredible city and for the Boston Bruins fans.\"\nThe Bruins are expected to retire Bergeron's No. 37, making him the 12th player so honoured.

With him as the captain and the first-line center, the Bruins set NHL records with 65 wins and 135 points, and Bergeron won an unprecedented sixth Selke Trophy as the NHL's top defensive forward.\nBut Bergeron missed the first four games of the playoffs with a herniated disk, and the Presidents Trophy winners lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Florida Panthers.\n'Right time to step away'\nBergeron wrote Tuesday that he knows \"how blessed and lucky I feel to have had the career that I have had, and that I have the opportunity to leave the game I love on my terms.\"\n\"It wasn't a decision that I came to lightly,\" he said. \"But after listening to my body, and talking with my family, I know in my heart that this is the right time to step away from playing the game I love.\"\nPLAYER STATS: Patrice Bergeron\nFLA WINS 4-3\nPanthers shock record-setting Bruins with Game 7 OT win, advance to face Leafs in 2nd round\nIn all, Bergeron scored 427 goals and 1,040 regular-season points in 19 seasons \u2014 all with the Bruins, who selected him in the second round of the 2003 draft.\u00a0He added 50 goals and 78 points in the playoffs, leading the Bruins to the Stanley Cup final three times, and scoring twice \u2014 one of them shorthanded \u2014 in the Game 7 clincher against Vancouver. The French-speaking native of the Quebec City suburbs also won two Olympic gold medals with Canada.\nHe is third all-time for the 100-year-old franchise in goals, points and games played (1,294), and fourth in assists behind only Hall of Famers Ray Bourque, Johnny Bucyk and Bobby Orr. With Bergeron's retirement, Brad Marchand becomes the only remaining member of the 2011 championship team, though Milan Lucic re-signed with the team this summer after eight seasons away.\nTo his teammates, Bergeron wrote: \"I have tried to learn something from each and every one of you and I always tried to be the best teammate that I could be. I will never forget your trust, the laughs, the endless memories, the ups and downs, and ultimately the long lasting friendships. I will forever be grateful being a part of such an exceptional group of men, and I will carry the pride of winning in 2011 with me forever.\"\nHe also thanked the Bruins management and staff, the Boston fans and media, and his teammates and family and ended with a message to the next generation of hockey players.\n\"I had a dream at 12 years old, and through hard work and perseverance my dreams came true more than I ever could have imagined,\" he wrote. \"Respect the game and your peers. Welcome adversity and simply enjoy yourself. No matter where you go from there the game will bring you so much happiness.\"",

Nicknamed The Tap Queen, she was known for her skilled routines and was booked to perform every week.\nShe loved tap dancing, telling CBC in 2014 that it was a religion for her.\u00a0\nPhilip, who is also a tap dancer, said Bruneau had an incredible strength of spirit and was a strict teacher who was able to transfer her passion for tap dancing to her students.\u00a0\nThat energy and love for the genre\u00a0are what captivated Tanya and Travis Knights as children.

(Reisch had seen Oppenheimer at an advance press screening the day before).\n\"We planned it a week ago and it was, like: perfect date,\" Reisch, 45,\u00a0said over the phone. His mother had seen the exhibit years before and had already recommended it several times.\nThe results of 'Barbenheimer' weekend are in. Who took the box office crown?\nWhen Reisch and his partner entered Les\u00a0Cours Mont-Royal shopping centre (part of Montreal's underground network of malls)\u00a0where the free Barbie Expo is \u2014 or was\n\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\nthey were confused by signs telling them the Expo had moved to another floor and a security guard telling them it\u00a0was, in fact, closed.\n\"It's like this old weird mall with like so many weird hallways, and the exhibit itself is like tucked behind some fringe stores,\" Reisch said.\nInstead of a candy-coated dreamland full of plastic\u00a0dolls, what Reisch and his partner found looked more like a bunker.\u00a0The floor where a fountain had been was stripped to its bare concrete and the walls were empty except for empty display cases where dolls had once been exhibited.\nThe room where the Barbie Expo had been in the Les Cours Mont Royal shopping centre experienced water damage. \n \n(Submitted by Martin Reisch/\u00a9 safesolvent)\nOne eerie display remained: a miniature moving runway carrying doll models was still working, accompanying music and all. Another similar display behind it features a casino scene with Barbie and Ken dolls dressed in gowns and suits.\n\"And then the\u00a0whole thing is empty where all the light boxes were and the whole main area is just crumbling concrete and waterlogged wood, and it's super mysterious, completely bizarre,\" Reisch said.\u00a0\nThe impetus behind the permanent Barbie show, \nwhich opened in Les Cours\u00a0in 2016\n, is also somewhat mysterious. Its website vaunts the brands, designers and celebrities featured among the Barbie dolls in the show, but there is no explanation of how it came about.\nA message at the top of the main page announcing in capital letters that the Barbie Expo is temporarily closed is equally enigmatic.\u00a0\nA single display remains at the Barbie Expo in Montreal, which experienced water damage and is expected to reopen in the coming weeks.\n \n(Submitte by Martin Reisch/\u00a9 safesolvent)\n\"We genuinely apologize for any disappointment this may cause and appreciate your support and interest in the Barbie Expo,\" it says, without giving a reason for the shutdown.\u00a0\nA phone call to Les Cours reveals the Barbie Expo's bad luck. The section of the shopping centre that houses the exhibit\u00a0experienced water damage, worsened by the heavy rainfall and flooding from \nthat big storm\n\u00a0on July 13.\u00a0\n\"I know, I know, it's a bad timing, I know,\" said Valerie Law, the mall's head of communications and marketing.\n\"Over the weekend, our team of social media, the phone messages were popping every minute. Bing! Bing! Bing! 'Where is the Expo? What happened?'\"\nLaw said the team answered every message,\u00a0the Expo is being moved to another floor of the shopping centre and will\u00a0hopefully reopen in the coming weeks.\nReisch published pictures of the damaged room where the Expo had been on social media in responding to one person's post that the Expo had \"fumbled the bag\" and that \"having the whole thing indefinitely closed for the entirety of the Barbie movie's promo run is a mistake of huge proportions.\"\u00a0\nReisch says he still thinks the people behind the Expo could have made some kind of acknowledgement of the irony of the situation.\u00a0\nThe person who said the Expo had made a mistake followed up, saying, [sic] \"omg this is tragic, sorry to the barbie expo for saying that you had fumbled the bag. it is, in fact, the anti-flood infrastructure of the peel suites building that fumbled the bag.\"\nAs for the Barbie movie itself, Reisch, a photographer and filmmaker himself, says he loved it.\u00a0\n\"I thought it was great. I'm a big \nGreta Gerwig\n fan,\" he said, adding that he liked Oppeneimer, too. \"I love that they're riding off each other's marketing in a whole kind of\u00a0a cultural thing.\"",

        "content": "A Canadian researcher who has been detained in Algeria since February on charges that he published secret information and accepted money to commit offences against public order will stand trial next month.\nRaouf\u00a0Farrah\u00a0is scheduled to stand trial Aug. 8 in the Algerian\u00a0city of Constantine, his lawyer Kouceila Zerguine\u00a0said Tuesday. His client is innocent, he said.\n\"He didn't commit the two crimes that he has been charged with,\"\u00a0Zerguine said during an interview from Algeria. \"During the inquiry, we submitted all the material evidence that refutes the charges.\"\nFarrah's 67-year-old father, Sebti Farrah, a Montreal-area resident, was arrested with his son while they were visiting relatives in Algeria and is scheduled to stand trial at the same time. Released on bail in mid-April after his health deteriorated, the father is also charged with receiving funds to commit offences against public order.\nZerguine said the younger Farrah is also experiencing health problems, as a knee injury for which he had been receiving physical therapy has worsened during his time in jail. However, three requests for pretrial release have been denied, Zerguine said.\nAfter analyst detained 100 days in Algeria, his Quebec family begs for release\nFriends, family members and colleagues have been calling for Farrah's release since he was jailed on Feb. 20.\nMark Micallef, the director of the North Africa and the Sahel Observatory at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, where Farrah worked as a senior analyst, said his colleague was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nDescribed as 'meticulous' researcher\nHe said Farrah's legal ordeal stems from the fact that he knows people who were involved in aiding the escape of a pro-democracy activist who had been banned from leaving Algeria. Micallef said Farrah doesn't know the activist, Amira Bouraoui, and wasn't involved in her flight.\nMicallef said he's hopeful that the trial will allow Farrah, 36, to clear his name.\nActivist Amira Bouraoui flashes a victory sign as she is released from prison of Kolea in 2020. She recently escaped from the country.\n \n(Anis Belghoul/AP Photo)\nWhile the charges of publishing classified information appear to be related to Farrah's work for the observatory, Micallef said there was nothing in his writings that went beyond what would be expected from a researcher studying organized crime.\n\"He's extremely passionate about his work, very meticulous,\" said Micallef. \"He cares about communities, he cares about trying to develop insights that can help develop effective policy that would make a difference to people on the ground.''\nBorn in Algeria, Farrah moved to Canada when he was 18. He studied mathematics at the Universit\u00e9\u00a0de Montr\u00e9al, before returning for a second bachelor's degree in philosophy and politics.\nFarrah then got a master's degree at the University of Ottawa, writing his thesis on security and migration in North Africa, issues he continues to study in his work.\nRita Abrahamsen, the director of the university's Centre for International Policy Studies, supervised his master's thesis. She is regularly in touch with Farrah's wife and said the conditions in the jail where he's being held are very basic.\n\"He's doing well, but he's doing well under the circumstances. He's strong, he's resilient, but he's lost a lot of weight and the longer the situation goes on, the harder it is,\"\u00a0she said.\nUnderstanding the political context\nEric Goldstein, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division, said the reasons for Farrah's arrest are unclear but it came amid a larger crackdown against the country's pro-democracy movement.\n\"Anyone who is working for an NGO that shows some distance from government positions is at risk of arrest,\" Goldstein said in an interview.\nHe said the verdict in Farrah's trial will likely be based on political calculations, not the law. \"He doesn't belong in prison in the first place. We've seen absolutely nothing in his file that would be considered an offence in any rights-respecting legal regime,'' Goldstein said.\nFarrah's family said in a statement issued in the spring that his wife has been able to visit him for 20 minutes every two weeks. However, he has not seen his four-year-old daughter since his arrest.\nGlobal Affairs Canada said it is aware of the situation\n\"Canadian officials are providing consular assistance to the concerned individual and their family via its embassy in Algiers and headquarters in Ottawa,\"\u00a0spokesman J\u00e9r\u00e9mie B\u00e9rub\u00e9\u00a0wrote in an email, adding that no further information could be provided for privacy reasons.\nThe Algerian Embassy in Ottawa did not respond to an emailed request for comment on the case sent last week.",

Just as it was ready to be harvested, it was gone.\nBut this wasn't just about the garlic.\nDelisle worried\u00a0that seeing the fruits of their labour poached could discourage the school's young gardeners.\u00a0\n\"I must admit it's a big challenge to keep teenagers interested and an event like this could have an effect of demotivating them and losing their commitment,\" she said.\nSurprise donation raises spirits\nWhen the\u00a0people at Tourne-Sol Cooperative Farm, based in nearby Les C\u00e8dres, heard what had happened, they offered to donate 90 garlic bulbs to make up for the students' loss.\u00a0\nThe situation is \"very, very sad,\" said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Th\u00e9riault, a member of the co-op. \"We wanted to make sure the students are able to replant for next year.\"\u00a0\nWith little to show for all the students' labours, the co-ordinator of the garden project worried there would be little incentive for them to put in more hard work.\n \n(Kwabena Oduro/CBC)\nTh\u00e9riault\u00a0said local organic garlic is expensive \"so some people maybe steal it for their own consumption and some people maybe steal it for resale.\"\u00a0\nIn fact, garlic theft has become almost a perennial story. In 2020, someone stole 120 bulbs from a garden at a high school in Montreal's West Island. The owner of a micro-farm in Shefford, Que. also reported garlic theft in 2019 \u2014 with 2,000 bulbs gone.\u00a0\nThe farmers who care for the high school garden during the summer received a garlic donation from a nearby co-operative.

        "content": "An initiative\u00a0that would have seen producers of non-alcoholic beverages pay recycling fees in Ontario has been paused, with the organization set to run it citing the province's recent move to explore a different system for recovering cans and bottles.\nThe Canadian Beverage Container Recycling Association (CBCRA) said Friday that there is \"no viability\" to continue with the Recycle Everywhere program that had been set\u00a0to take effect\u00a0at the end of July after several earlier delays.\nRecycle Everywhere was intended to be one element of the \nprovince's overhauled Blue Box program\n, which in part shifts responsibility for covering the costs of recycling from taxpayers to companies that produce the waste.\nA statement from CBCRA's Executive Director Ken Friesen\u00a0said there is no point in implementing the system \"while the Ontario government adjusts the parameters for beverage container producer responsibility and explores a deposit return system for the recovery of non-alcoholic beverage containers.\"\nBig beverage companies plan to charge recycling fees in Ontario. Will stores pass the cost on to you?\nOntario considering deposit-and-return system like The Beer Store's for non-alcoholic drink containers\nIn a June letter obtained by CBC Toronto,\u00a0Minister of Environment David Piccini\u00a0invited industry stakeholders to \njoin a working group to develop\u00a0a deposit return system\n\u00a0for the province, similar to the one that already exists for alcoholic beverage containers through The Beer Store.\u00a0\n\"Such a system would enable consumers to receive a refund for returning used beverage containers, promoting recycling, reducing litter, and encouraging sustainable practices,\" Piccini wrote.\u00a0\nThe letter did not include a timeline for the implementation of such a system, but it came\u00a0in the wake of controversy over the pending Recycle Everywhere program.\nThe CBCRA,\u00a0which includes such major industry players as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Refresco, had intended to\u00a0impose\u00a0fees\u00a0of one to three cents on each bottle, can, carton or drink box sold in Ontario. But it wasn't clear if consumers would ultimately see those fees\u00a0tacked on at the checkout\u00a0or buried within the price of drinks, since producers had the option to offload the cost onto retailers.\nThe plan drew criticism from retail associations, among them the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers, which didn't want their members to bear the brunt of the new fees.\nAt one point, Piccini\u00a0had threatened to block producers from dumping the fees onto retailers and in turn consumers. But there was nothing in existing legislation to give authority to do so. In the end, Piccini only urged producers not to pass the costs on to the public.\nIn a statement sent to CBC News, a spokesperson for Piccini\u00a0said any changes have to meet the province's waste diversion targets, as well as avoid passing unnecessary fees on to customers.\n\"We are working alongside industry and producers to make recycling simpler and easier while keeping costs down for people across the province,\" the statement reads.\nOntario finalizes plans to overhaul blue box program\nThe CBCRA had estimated it would have collected some $80 million per year from the fees, which would be used to fund\u00a0\n250,000 recycling bins\n\u00a0in locations across Ontario\u00a0as well as awareness campaigns to boost recycling.\u00a0\nIt has been running a similar program since 2011 in Manitoba, where 72 per cent of all beverage containers are now recovered, up from 42 per cent when the program began.\nThe provincial government has mandated that the industry recover 80 per cent of all beverage containers by 2030. A\u00a0\nconsultant's report\n\u00a0found just 46 per cent of non-alcoholic drink containers were diverted from landfills in Ontario in 2019.\u00a0",

She's spoken to elders throughout healing workshops and hopes the trip helps them continue to heal.\u00a0\n\"There's\u00a0a lot of that feeling of shame that they were the ones who did something wrong \u2014 that it was their fault and they shouldn't talk about what happened,\" Kiddell-Monroe said. \"Now they're ready to talk.\"\nInuit families torn apart\nThe sanatorium once stood near the edge of the escarpment overlooking the city on Sanatorium Road, near Scenic Drive. It's since been demolished to make way for redevelopment, but a giant \nCross of Lorraine\n that once glowed brightly still stands.\u00a0\nAbout 1,200 Inuit were shipped to Hamilton's sanatorium for tuberculosis treatment, as part of a Canada-wide\u00a0colonial policy that \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\n\u00a0has since apologized for.

She tested positive for tuberculosis and was told she'd be sent to Southern Canada for treatment, Tatty said.\nAtagoyuk was still nursing and allowed to bring her infant daughter,\u00a0said Tatty, who wasn't yet born.\u00a0But when Atagoyuk and her daughter arrived in Toronto, the baby was taken from her and put into foster care. They were separated for 3\u00bd\u00a0years as Atagoyuk was held in the sanatorium.\u00a0\n'Terrified and traumatized.'

Here's why\nAtagoyuk wasn't allowed to leave her bed, but made friends with the other patients.\n\"They tried to make some good of the times, but it was very hard and tough,\" Tatty said. \"They only had each other.\"\u00a0\nWhen Atagoyuk was finally released, she reunited with her daughter and returned to Nunavut, but the damage had been done.\u00a0\n\"My sister was afraid of my mother because she thought she was a monster,\" Tatty said. \"She wasn't used to being around Inuit. She had lost her language and they couldn't communicate with each other. They were both traumatized.\"\u00a0\nPublic reception to be held at art gallery\nTatty said her mother was in the front row for Trudeau's apology in 2019. It\u00a0included the launch of the Nanilavut initiative, a database that will help Inuit find the graves of family members who didn't survive, and funding to help them visit those graves.\u00a0 \nHowever, there is no federal funding available for trips like the one to Hamilton, said Kiddell-Monroe. It was instead supported by SeeChange and Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the legal representative of the Inuit of Nunavut.\u00a0\nThe Mountain Sanatorium was founded in 1906 to provide care for people from Hamilton and the surrounding communities who were ill with tuberculosis. Between 1958 and 1962, 1272 Inuit were treated at the Mountain Sanatorium for tuberculosis.  \n \n(Black Mount Collection, Hamilton Public Library, Local History & Archives)\nThe group will visit the former sanatorium site and cemetery where Inuit who died of tuberculosis were buried, and take part in healing circles and workshops with trauma counsellors. They also hope to connect with any doctors or nurses who worked at the sanatorium, or their family members.\u00a0\n\"And it's not for recrimination,\" said Kiddell-Monroe. \"It's not to be angry. It's just to be able to see them, and to share the experience, and to kind of complete the circle.\"\u00a0\nThey'll also view historic photos of patients from McMaster University's archives and the Art Gallery of Hamilton's collection of Inuit art made by sanatorium patients.\u00a0\nA public event will be held at the Art Gallery of Hamilton on Tuesday from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. ET, including a reception and film screening.\u00a0\nInuit elders making historic healing journey from Nunavut to Hamilton's former sanatorium\n1 day ago\nDuration \n4:25\nMore than a dozen Inuit elders are making a historic healing journey to Hamilton Monday to revisit the former sanatorium site where they were held in isolation for tuberculosis treatment in the 1950s and '60s.",

The CBC's Jasmine Kabatay paid the museum a visit to check it out.\nEven though he was more reserved about Barbie with his friends as a child, as an adult, Belisle is more open with what he's interested in.\n\"I do believe if, say, 20 years ago it came out, when I was 9 or 10\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I don't really think I'd be as open or as excited about it as I would be now,\" said Belisle.\n\"And not only that, I feel like if I was excited for it, then I feel like people would make, I guess, the stereotype of a gay joke. I think that's a big thing as well.\"\nBelisle\u00a0believes 2023's\u00a0big-budget \nBarbie\n will allow people to laugh\u00a0and just enjoy themselves.\n\"I also believe that it's more accepting now than it was then. Take myself, say, 20 years ago. I don't think it would have been the same excitement for me or the same outward excitement for it. I guess it's just that times have changed. Why not be excited about it?\"\nJesse Collier, Brampton\nJesse Collier of Brampton, Ont., says it wasn't until he became a father that he started to experience the world of Barbie, through her eyes.\n \n(Submitted by Jesse Collier)\nLike most film buffs this summer, Collier, 39,\u00a0plans\u00a0to see both \nBarbie\n and \nOppenheimer\n, \nmaking it a double feature and a cinematic weekend experience.\nHe became interested after hearing Margot Robbie was cast as the \nBarbie\n lead, but seeing the first trailer convinced him it was something he wanted to watch.\u00a0\n\"I was like,\u00a0'Oh wait a minute, this looks like a really funny script, and it's kind of a lot of like a meta-comedy and stuff.' So that kind of peaked my interest and now I've been following it ever since.\"\nBarbie was never really one of his childhood toys. But everything changed when he became a father.\u00a0Now, he gets to\u00a0experience the Barbie universe through his daughter's eyes.\n\"It's great,\" said Collier. \"Her very first Barbie was an astrophysicist Barbie, which came with a telescope. So that kind of got her interested in the planets and looking at stars and stuff like that. So definitely very positive.\"\nWATCH\u00a0| Ryan Gosling tells GQ magazine what 'Kenergy' is all about:\nCollier believes men have been influenced by messages they've heard their entire lives\u00a0\u2014 such as\u00a0they're \"not supposed to like stuff like that.\"\n\"That's still kind of ingrained in them that some stuff is for men and some stuff is for women. So, you know, you shouldn't be excited for it. And it's still prevalent in our society, people that think that way.\n\"But I think it's definitely changing for the better. I think a lot of men kind of put that toxic masculinity to the side and say, 'You know what, this looks like a good movie.'\"\nCollier said he had planned to\u00a0see \nBarbie\n\u00a0with his wife, but\u00a0she's going with other friends, so he may watch the film alone \u2014 well,\u00a0sort of.\n\"[It's] going to be interesting, a grown man going to see \nBarbie\n all by himself. But you know what? I don't care. I'll just go and see it, catch a matinee \u2026 maybe I'll bring all my daughter's Barbies.\"",

        "content": "After months of ethnic violence that has left over 130 people dead and 60,000 displaced in Manipur, India, members of Montreal's Indian diaspora gathered on Monday night to hold a vigil and demand the Indian government step up to stem the bloodshed.\u00a0\nSince May, mobs have rampaged through villages in Manipur, murdering people and torching houses. Last week, despite the internet being largely blocked and journalists being locked out in the remote state, a video surfaced online showing two women paraded naked in a field and sexually assaulted by scores of young men.\nThe incident happened in early May and protesters in Montreal's Indian community say the government has failed to act since the trouble began, leaving mobs to run amok.\n\"I'm absolutely livid,\" said Birapka Sharone. She hails from the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, but she took to the streets of Parc-Extension to voice her outrage.\n\"We're here as Indians, as expatriates, as the Indian diaspora.

A disturbing viral video has surfaced showing two women being sexually assaulted by a mob. It was part of an ongoing ethnic conflict in the state of Manipur and the video has sparked outrage across India.\nHe finally commented on the state's affairs after the video showing the sexual assault of two women triggered massive outrage and went viral late Wednesday.\nModi condemned the alleged sexual assault of women in Manipur state as \"shameful\" and promised tough action in his first comments on deadly violence in the remote northeastern region.\nHowever, those words came months too late for Sharone.\nHere's why India's Manipur state has been gripped by months of violence\nAfter brutal assaults on 2 women and widespread violence, India's PM finally speaks\n\"For him to wait over two months to be able to say something about such a horrific incident, it speaks volumes,\" she said. \"The only reason he's spoken up now is because it went viral.\"\nSharone says minorities in India face an increasing threat of violence while attackers are able to act with impunity.\n'Draconian' internet shutdowns in parts of India mean Canadians can't contact family. And it's happened before\nRabia Bains, who hails from the Indian state of Punjab in the country's north, also wanted to voice her anger.\n\"It's not just the violence, but the apathy of the government, of the people who knew about it,\" said Baines. \"It boils our blood.\"\nBut the Montreal protesters are not alone in saying the Indian government has failed to act to stem the violence.\nSanjib Baruah, political science professor at Bard College in New York, studies borderlands like Manipur, which is straddles India and Myanmar.\nBaruah says he is surprised by the recent levels of \"extraordinary\" violence, which falls more along ethnic than religious lines.\u00a0\nConflict has been brewing in the region for years\u00a0but has now been brought to a head by the demand for special status, he says.\u00a0\n\"The lack of political will on the part of the government\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not capacity\u00a0\u2014\u00a0is the most disturbing thing for me,\" Baruah said. He said India's constitution allows for Modi to dismiss local Manipur officials \u2014 something the central government has done in the past in previous regions of the country to restore order.\nBaruah says\u00a0the Kuki people see\u00a0the government as siding with the Meteis\u00a0as the Manipur's chief minister,\u00a0Biren Singh, is Meitei and a member of the BJP.\nCBC reached out to the High Commission of India in Ottawa for comment but didn't hear back by publication time.",

        "content": "Farmers in Huron County are welcoming news that internet access to their region could soon be improving, but still want the provincial and federal governments to make rural connectivity a higher priority.\nOn July 14, Huron Bruce MPP Lisa Thompson announced a $1.4-million investment to bring high speed internet to residents and businesses in Huron County. Both the province and federal government\u00a0are partnering with the Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology project to bring connectivity to 720 residents in the region.\u00a0\n\"By continuing to build a new broadband infrastructure in Huron county, we're helping strengthen our local rural community,\" said Thompson in a press release statement. \"This investment is helping to support the growing utilization of real-time data on farms and in our rural businesses.\"\nBroadband service lagging in northern Ontario: report\nEthan Wallace is a dairy and cash crop farmer based in Huron County who relies heavily on internet connectivity to run his business. His farm features remote controlled tractors that use GPS to ensure inch perfect accuracy when sowing seed or applying fertilizer.\nAnimal health is increasingly being monitored using 'fit-bit' like devices. \n \n(Submitted photo)\nThe cattle on his farm wear the animal equivalent of fitbits which monitor their health and relay valuable information about optimal feeding or milking times.\n\u00a0\"All that information is coming to my phone every second of everyday,\" Wallace said. \"So the internet is very key to what we do.\"\nLISTEN | Improved internet in Huron County could be a game changer for some farmers:\nAfternoon Drive\n6:07\nImproved internet in Huron County could be a game changer for some farmers\nPeople in Huron County could soon get an internet upgrade thanks to provincial funding. And that is good news for famers who use the internet for everything: from GPS controlled tractors, to animal fitbits. Host Allison Devereaux speaks with the Huron and Perth director for the Ontario Federation of Agriculture, Ethan Wallace.\nWallace, who is also the Huron and Perth director for the Ontario Federation of Agriculture,\u00a0said the basic, old-school style of farming has given way to an approach that relies heavily on computing power and connectivity. Increasingly, farmers are running businesses that resemble tech companies more than agricultural ones.\u00a0\nI live just north of Toronto and can't get reliable internet\n\"It's that old-adage of the hay feed farm boy right, they see the picture of the old red bank barn and that's not what we are anymore,\" Wallace said. \"We are very much on the cutting edge of technology.\"\nModern tractors use GPS for navigation and accuracy when completing farm tasks. High speed and reliable connectivity is critical for their operations.  \n \n(Submitted photo)\nSome farms limited by lack of high-speed connection\nWallace currently has a 150 mbps fibre connection running to his farm, which makes his operation possible, but that connection is not readily available to everyone. Just a few kilometres down the road, his neighbour Mark Vogels operates a 100-acre cash crop farm, but is only able to access the internet using the cellular network in the area. This severely limits what Vogels can do on his farm.\u00a0\n\"If we had more access to it, we would have more access to things out in the field like GPS,\" Vogels said.\u00a0\nNo timetable has been given for when the 720 Huron County residents can expect to see high speed internet access brought to their homes, and the CBC was not able to obtain a concrete plan for the rollout.\u00a0\nFirst Nations high-speed internet access lagging behind Canadian average\nVogels said the $1.4 million\u00a0in funding is a good start, but likely won't be enough to meet the needs of everyone\u00a0in Huron County. Wallace said\u00a0the provincial and federal governments need to place the same emphasis on internet connectivity that they once did on expanding the electric grid to rural areas more than a century ago.\nMilking machines like the Lely Astronaut rely heavily on internet connectivity to operate effectively. \n \n(Submitted photo)",

        "content": "Canadian rocker Sass Jordan's career has spanned more than three decades and she says while her touring schedule is different now, she still loves to connect with fans while on stage and see her music resonate with them.\nJordan, known for songs like \nTell Somebody\n and \nMake You A Believer\n,\u00a0will join local musician Conor Gains and Canadian icon Kim Mitchell on stage Saturday night in downtown Kitchener, Ont., for the Wayback Festival.\nShe spoke to Craig Norris, host of CBC Kitchener-Waterloo's \nThe Morning Edition\n, on Friday ahead of the concert.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0\nThe full audio of the interview is below.\nJordan was full of energy for the interview and said she enjoys getting up really early each morning because \"you get to see the sun come up and the birds start singing and the grass you've got like the dew on it and the air smells fresh and there's no bloody traffic jams because it's too early.\"\nCraig Norris:\n How does getting up at 5:00 a.m. and seeing all this and experiencing the glories of life that I agree with \u2026. how does that jive with touring and things like that?\nSass Jordan: \nYou just don't tour, that's how you do it. Stay the heck away from touring. [laughs]\nWhat I do basically, in these days, is I do what we call one-off. So you fly to the destination the day before you do the show and then you fly home the next day.\u00a0\nObviously on those days, unless it's an early flight, I'm not up with the birds sadly.\nNorris: \nSo when you do these one-offs \u2026 when you see people out there and you're connecting with them, and even though these songs are now, in some cases, you know, over 20 years old, what happens inside you when you see these crowds that just love these tunes?\nJordan:\n It's a joyful thing, of course. I always think of music as medicine and as healing for myself and for anyone else who wants to join in. And so it's an extremely uplifting thing.\u00a0\nI mean, assuming the sound isn't god awful, it can be really horrible.\nBut even if it's really horrible, I just reach into this sort of space inside myself where I just plug into that and then I start to see and feel all the people that are there and it sort of lifts me out of it.\u00a0\nIt's amazing and it's incredible to see that. It's incredible to see people responding to something that is genuinely, like you said, 20 years old. I think you're being very, very conservative.\nNorris: \nIn my defence, I said more than 20 years old.\nJordan: \nWe're talking dinosaur.\nNorris: \nBut I compare it to people and acts where they pick an album from, say, 15 years ago and they say we're not going to do anything from before that album.\nJordan: \nThat just doesn't make any sense. No, I'm in the business of making people happy, including myself, obviously. And I know there's something about what you grew up listening to that really \u2014\u00a0I mean \u2014\u00a0it's like smells, you know? Grandma's apple pie brings you right back to being like eight years old. Well, [Jordan's song] \nMake You Believe\n, it brings you right back to being 15 years old.\nMusic's really powerful like that, you know?\u00a0\nNorris: \nI do want to go back, though, because I read that when you started out back in the 80s, totally different, right? It was difficult to get your songs on radio because you're a woman. Radio stations, were told\u00a0don't have too many female voices in a row.\nJordan:\n It was more the 90s, actually.\nSass Jordan on stage at the 1992 Big Valley Jamboree.\n \n(CBC)\nNorris: \nYeah, and the music industry has changed since then, right? I mean, is it different now?\nJordan:\n Oh my gosh. Everything's changed. There is nothing that's the same as it was back then. Like not even the air quality, for goodness sake.\nSo but yes, dramatically and it will continue to do so because you know that's the nature of reality really is that everything just changes including me.\nNorris: \nThere are truths though, right? I mean\u00a0I think about the fact that before you go and play and Kim [Mitchell] plays tomorrow, there's going to be a whole bunch of young performers on stage. Deep heartfelt in your heart, what kind of advice do you give to young people now who want to get into this industry?\nJordan: \nThere's so many answers to that question I'd like. I always go basically just get the heck out whatever you do?\nNorris:\u00a0\nWait a second. Get out and play?\u00a0Or get out of this business.\nJordan: \nGet the hell out of this business [laughs]. It's a complete joke.\u00a0\nI really, honestly, this is what I say to them: I say, 'Do you love what you're doing?' And they always say yes, and then I say, 'Well then you're doing the right thing.'\nThe fact is I do not have the, shall I say, wisdom to tell them what to do in the world they're in now.\u00a0\nI don't know. That's not what I went through. I'm from another time and I could have given them advice as to what I was doing back then.\u00a0\nAnything I say, I don't know how it works now. Do you know what I mean? Like I fell out of my area of expertise.\u00a0\nWhat I could help them with is emotional wellness, how to take care of your voice, how to deal with people in general.\nNorris:\n\u00a0Your voice is super important.\nJordan:\n Indeed it is. People who sing for sure, that's what keeps you in business.\nLISTEN\u00a0|\u00a0\nSass Jordan on changes to the music industry, still feeling the love from fans during concerts\n:\nThe Morning Edition - K-W\n9:06\nSass Jordan on changes to music industry, still feeling the love from fans during concerts\nCanadian musician Sass Jordan will be at the Wayback Festival in Kitchener on Saturday.

She relies on deliveries for 90 per cent\u00a0of her business, but when the street closes down on weekends for Walk Queen, Gigovic\u00a0says it creates issues for her.\n\"The street is closed on Friday, and my last run is after 3:30 p.m. Nobody from the delivery service wants to come pick up my flowers because there is no chance for them to park,\" Gigovic said.\nThe one delivery company Gigovic could find to do her weekend deliveries\u00a0charges her \"five times more\" than others and a second company has declined to do weekend deliveries\u00a0altogether.\n\"So I lost, because I can't charge customers more than what is normal,\" she said.\nWalk Queen meant to bring community together\nWalk Queen was originally organized near the beginning of Ontario's COVID-19 restrictions as a way for the community to safely come together outdoors and socially distanced.\nHespeler's BIA decided to keep the summer event rolling this summer, closing a portion of the road from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon. The BIA website says it's a way for both community members and tourists to enjoy Hespeler and visit its downtown shops and restaurants.\n\"It's nice to see, you know, we want customers here, but in another way. Not like this,\" Gigovic\u00a0said.\nGoran Radulovic, Gigovic's\u00a0husband, said he doesn't see many people taking part in Walk Queen.\n\"The people that come through, the traffic, it's miniscule,\" he said.\nThey're not alone in their frustrations. Gabriella\u00a0Martone, who has\u00a0worked at Continental Hairstyling on Queen Street for 35 years, shared similar\u00a0concerns.\n\"It's a gongshow,\" Martone said.\nShe said the salon's older customer base don't make appointments on weekends because Walk Queen is on.\n\"They avoid coming down here,\" she said.\nJudy Carr, another hairdresser at the salon,\u00a0said that some of\u00a0her customers have difficulty with mobility and the closed road forces them to park further away.\u00a0\nCarr and Martone said the street closure has been beneficial for the bars on the block. The Aging Oak, for example, sets out chairs and tables and provides live music in the evenings which makes good use of the closed street, they said.\nTo combat the decline in weekend business, Carr and Martone started a petition to remove the barricades on weekends. As of July 19, the document has over 500 signatures.\u00a0\n'It's been great'\nDylan Jozkow alternates working between Hespeler's Fashion History Museum and at Encore Vintage, a retro pop-up boutique put on by the museum. He said Walk Queen has helped the store and the weekends have seen brisk business.\n\"We think it's been great,\" he said.\u00a0\"We try and have nice displays so that kind of attracts people in. It's only been beneficial.\"\nJozkow has lived his whole life in Hespeler and said the street closure is a very welcome change.\n\"They've never really had an active downtown until Walk Queen.\"\nJozkow mentioned\u00a0the pop-up's opening coincided with the beginning of this year's Walk Queen, \"so we don't really have a comparison to before.\"",

        "content": "During his second year of university in 1996, Steve Byfield was looking for part-time employment, and found a job as a customer service agent at\u00a0The Brew Factory \u2014 where customers could make their own beer and wine.\nHamilton-based Byfield \u2014 who was born and raised in Kitchener to Jamaican immigrants \u2014 said he was immediately \"bitten by the wine bug\" and was so \"intrigued with winemaking\" that his plan\u00a0to teach music\u00a0went out the window.\n\"Within, I'd say, two months of that job, working twice a week through studies, I really got fascinated with the whole process of winemaking and wanted to learn more,\" Byfield told CBC Hamilton.\n\"So, by the time I graduated from university I was really fascinated with it, enthralled with it, in love with it and figured it would be kind of cool to see the winemaking process from the commercial end.\"\nHe said that opportunity presented itself a year and a half later when he was hired as a product consultant at Southbrook Farms, which was located at Richmond Hill, Ont. A year later he was offered an apprenticeship opportunity to become a winemaker.\nWatch: Steve Byfield talks about pairing wine with your favourite food\nWhat wine goes best with Jerk Chicken? Steve Byfield might be the only winemaker in Canada who knows\n4 days ago\nDuration \n3:20\nAfter many years working in Canada's wine industry, Steve Byfield says he's never met another Black winemaker. Here's what he has to say about making wine in Canada.\nToday, Byfield is one of only a few racialized\u00a0winemakers in Canada \u2014 and the only Black Canadian with their own wine label.\nByfield, 55,\u00a0is the owner of Nyarai Cellars, a virtual wine label. The company does not have a building or vineyard of its own, but contracts grapes from growers in the Niagara region. The wine is made at a winery\u00a0in Hamilton \u2014 West Avenue Cider House \u2014 where Nyarai Cellars has its own barrels and tanks.\n\"It's just a way for winemakers to essentially create a wine brand and run it as such, minus the overhead costs [associated with it] \u2014 owning a vineyard, owning property \u2014 and really allow them to develop that brand,\" Byfield said.\nSteve Byfield\n \n(Submitted by Sharon Little)\nWhen Byfield started Nyarai Cellars in 2008, his virtual wine label was one of only three in the Niagara region.\nBarriers to racialized individuals\nByfield said land ownership is among barriers facing racialized individuals entering the industry as winemakers.\n\"Most wineries are operations that have emerged from family farmsteads,\" he said.\u00a0 \n\"Despite the fact that communities of colour have always had a presence and involvement in the wine industry, primarily labour equity or farm work, opportunities to invest in properties may have been determining factors contributing to the lack of diversity in the ranks of winemakers,\" he said.\nHuge drop in grape harvest after 'superbly cold' winter event leaves Ontario winemakers worried\nUnpredictable winters causing significant damage to vineyards in Niagara region\nByfield said he \"definitely would love to see more\" racialized\u00a0individuals joining the industry.\n\"If you're passionate about it, if you're driven to learn and work hard, it is rewarding,\" he said.\n\"For me, from the winemaking end, it's a passion \u2026 so most mornings it's easy for me to get up [and head to work].\nResources to help new farmers\nWhile there are no specific programs for new entrants into winemaking, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) says it has introduced a number of initiatives to help both new and veteran farmers continue to grow across the province.\u00a0\nConnie Osborne, an\n \nOMAFRA spokesperson, said initiatives include a web portal that includes information and support on skills development, business planning, marketing, farm business transfer and other relevant subjects.\u00a0\nGrapes grow in vines in Niagara wine country in the summer of 2022 at Megalomaniac Winery in Vineland, Ontario.\n \n(Conrad Collaco/CBC)\nOsborne said there's also a\n \nbusiness resource guide, which \"provides information and resources to help new farmers start up, strengthen and grow farming operations.\"\nResources include getting started, building a business plan, crop production basics, livestock operation basics, and more, Osborne said.\nWinemakers, grape growers see bright future\nMeanwhile,\u00a0Ontario winemakers and grape growers anticipate substantial growth in this sector of the provincial economy, fuelling increases in investment, market share, jobs and related tourism.\n\"The growing recognition of the quality of Ontario VQA wines, the excellence of our wine country tourism experiences and the opportunities for growth will combine to take our world class industry to another level, with premium wine at the centre of a thriving economy and culture,\" Del Rollo, chair of Wine Growers Ontario, said in a \nnews release\n.\nVintners warn a wine shortage could be coming, as they try to adapt to climate change\nFor some Niagara-region winemakers and grape growers, adapting to climate change is a matter of survival\nAccording to Ontario's VQA Wine and Grape Industry's 2030 Vision, projected growth targets within the next seven years include:\nMore than 40,000 direct and indirect jobs in Ontario's grape and wine production, tourism and hospitality sectors.\nAnnual Ontario VQA wine sales of more than half a billion dollars (up from $385 million per year currently), with all-channel share of Ontario's wine market growing by 20 per cent (from current 13 per cent).\nThree million annual visitors to Ontario's wine regions (up from 2.6 million today).\nA 75 per cent increase in capital investment by Ontario wine producers, with 4 million new vines planted over 20,000 acres.\n'Very fortunate and thankful'\u00a0\nByfield said \"as a person of colour, having [my] own label,' challenges have been no different than everyone else in the industry.\n\"My experience has been good for the most part [and any challenges] are diminished by the overall goodwill of my peers who've been nothing but supportive,\" he said.\nIt's very \"humbling\" to hear the feedback of customers who enjoy the product, Byfield said.\n\"It keeps you very humble and I'm very fortunate and thankful for the accolades.\"\nOntario winemakers and grape growers anticipate substantial growth in this sector of the provincial economy, fuelling increases in investment, market share, jobs and related tourism.\n

        "summary": "In a sea of mainstream beer, micro-breweries are making waves at the liquor store and in bars. Food columnist Andrew Coppolino tells us about a successful craft beer business small enough to operate out of a home garage.",
        "content": "There are many garage bands, but garage breweries are few and far between. In fact, there is only one in Waterloo region, and perhaps even further afield, according to Curt and Holly Crossman.\nJust over a month ago, the Kitchener pair, along with business partners with strong ties to the community, opened Twas Now Brewing in their 200-square-foot\u00a0home garage in Kitchener's Auditorium Neighbourhood.\nThe brewery's name is a nod to an iconic scrawl of graffiti spray painted on the train bridge across the Grand River that was for decades visible from Victoria Street near the community of Breslau.\nFor the Twas Now Brewing crew, the graffiti captured part of their childhood \u2014 just as the enigmatic phrase and its paradoxical, Zen koan-like oxymoron rings a bell for a generation who grew up in the region and recall seeing the graffiti through the car window as they passed by the spot.\n\"There are a lot of people in the area who are familiar with the bridge and the graffiti. We wanted something nostalgic to childhood and growing up around this area for Twas Now's name. We all thought: 'Hey, many people know exactly what that bridge is!'\" says Holly Crossman.\nThe brewery was named after this iconic graffiti once scrawled across the Grand River bridge near the community of Breslau. \n \n(Flood)\nOn the other side of the trestle is the rejoinder to the near-inscrutable tag: \"'Tis Now.\" Curt says as a kid he and buddies from the neighbourhood, including a few of the brewery partners, would venture to the river near the bridge to catch crayfish..\nJoining the Crossmans as brewery co-owners are Curt's brother Robb Crossman, as well as\u00a0J.P. and Sarah Fleras, who live a few blocks away, Erik Balodis, who grew up on Borden Avenue; and Ben Cousineau, who also grew up in Kitchener.\nLike many brewers across the country, Curt experimented with home brewing, pouring the first unsuccessful batch down the drain.\nBut the recipes and techniques improved over time, and the group began talking about starting a brick-and-mortar brewery. The plans were derailed by the pandemic, and when they started up again, it was with a new idea for a home-garage\u00a0pico brewery.\nThere were only a few precedents, one of which was Evergreen Craft Ales in Kanata which started in a garage in 2015.\nThe Twas Now team all pitched in to refurbish the Crossman's garage. They installed mash tuns, fermenters, like the one seen above, glycol chillers and growler-filling equipment. They also built a 125-litre beer tank.\n \n(Andrew Coppolino/CBC)\nThe Twas Now partners invested in refurbishing the Crossman's garage by installing mash tuns, fermenters, glycol chillers and growler-filling equipment. They also\u00a0built a 125-litre \u2014 in beer talk, a 1.25 hectolitre \u2014 system.\n\"That's incredibly small. Compared to the smallest brewery you can think of, it's incredibly small,\" Curt says. \"We're brewing at a home-brew scale.\"\nThe Twas Now retail window is open for walk-up sales Saturdays 12 p.m. \u2013 5 p.m. Beer cannot be consumed on-site and must be taken home for drinking.\nTwas Now is about experimenting with flavours. With their small scale, they can quickly brew what they want, and what they hear their customers want, and not be limited to being known as an ale or sours brewery.\n\"We take traditional recipes and add something a little bit different,\" says Holly. \"We sold out of our Belgian pale ale. We added hibiscus flowers and rose hips for a different flavour, and it's a nice summer beer.\"\nTwas Now beer is offered in one-litre growlers and comes in a variety of flavours. \u201cWe take traditional recipes and add something a little bit different,\u201d says Holly Crossman. \n \n(Andrew Coppolino/CBC)\nFilling only one-litre growlers, currently on the beer menu is a hoppy Enzo Gorlomi\u00a0Italian pilsener and 100 Resolutions\u00a0New England IPA, along with Paper Hearts\u00a0witbier. So far, they've sold seven or eight different beers.\n\"I'd say we're doing better than expected. We're selling out of beer,\" Curt says. \"Our business plan had us brewing once every two weeks, but we brewed six times in the last two weeks.\"\nA sense of community\nThe set-up, regulatory and licensing process was relatively easy. Working with the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario was smooth but dealing with the city was less easy because there wasn't a precedent for a garage brewery, according to the Crossmans.\nMainstream beer brands used to rule the roost when it came to suds, while craft brewing was in its infancy in the 1980s. But that was then, and this is now: big-brewery sales have slumped recently, and while the craft industry has shaken out a bit and remains small, there are nearly 300 craft breweries in Ontario, and the vast majority of them are larger than Twas Now.\nBut as much as the partners are about the suds and honing their brewing repertoire, what has materialized at the garage has been a sense of community.\nCustomers walk right up to the Crossmans garage to order a growler of beer to take home. The Twas Now retail window is open for walk-up sales Saturdays 12 p.m. \u2013 5 p.m.\n \n(Andrew Coppolino/CBC)\nTwas Now, according to the Crossmans and their partners, is benefiting from people seeking the hyper-local brew\u00a0while\u00a0feeding a desire for walkable and cyclable cities \u2014 the kind Jane Jacobs advocated for starting in the 1960s.\nHolly says that's a serendipitous ancillary benefit to their garage brewery: aside from making the beer they love, Twas Now is about people.\n\"We've met neighbours that we didn't know before,\" she says. \"It's been fun that way. Everyone we've talked to has been super supportive.\"\nThat includes a customer from Oshawa visiting a friend in the east ward. When he heard about the brewery, he walked over to make a purchase.\n\"A couple from London were driving by, saw our sign and said they had to stop. They said this isn't something you see every day,\" adds Holly. \"They asked: 'How is there a brewery attached to a house in a neighbourhood?'\"\nRobb Crossman, Curt's brother and co-owner of Twas Now, prepares to fill a growler with one of the week's select beers.\n \n(Andrew Coppolino/CBC)\nAnother east ward resident, Rob Rittinger, says it's compelling. A neighbour tipped him off that there was going to be beer in the ward.\n\"I love it. Because of the garage, it's something unique, a neighbourhood thing. You walk to it from your house, buy beer, chat with the people here and go home. It's really quite comfortable,\" says Rittinger.\nHolly Crossman isn't surprised by the success.\n\"It's my experience that the K-W area has always been supportive of community. This is unique, and people have really been drawn to it. People can walk over, buy some beer on a Saturday, and take it back home for their barbecue.\"",

Now 25 years later he's leading a production on a movie about the life of the late Kitchener Golfer. David Carver explained his passion for telling Moe's story on The Morning Edition.",
        "content": "A movie is being made about the life of legendary Canadian golfer Moe Norman. Norman was born and raised in Kitchener and is remembered as the most consistent ball striker in the history of the game.\u00a0\nBut there was more to the man than the sport he played and film producer David Carver wants to tell that story in a film called\n The Place I Belong:\u00a0The Moe Norman Story\n.\u00a0\nDavid Carver joined CBC Kitchener-Waterloo's Craig Norris, host of \nThe Morning Edition\n, to talk about his journey to make the film.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nFull audio of the interview is below\n.\nCraig Norris:\n How were you introduced to the Moe Norman story?\nDavid Carver: \nMy father was regaling stories of Moe's golf prowess during a Christmas dinner one year and I just started\u00a0memorizing those stories just from him sharing them verbally.\nI started investigating who Moe was and I was pretty fascinated by just his ability on the golf course in the early stages, but eventually I started researching him even more.\nI realized there's more of this guy's story than just his ability on a golf course. I think his life journey is full of lessons that I think resonate globally and I think this is a globally appealing movie and we hope to release it theatrically around the world.\nNorris:\n What will people who have never heard of Moe Norman learn about the man and how he golfed through this film?\nCarver: \nWell, I think we're trying to accentuate the fact that ... in my opinion, he played the sport purely for the love of the game and I would argue there aren't too many athletes that can truly say that.\nBut in addition to that, he was just true to himself and I believe that he his philosophy was, you know, get me now, get me later, don't get me at all, that's up to you.\u00a0But I'm going to be me and be true to myself and play the game the way I want to play it. And you know you'll either kick me out of the amateur circuit or you'll bully me out of Professional Golf, but I'm going to continue to play and be me.\nBruce Beresford signed on to be Director less than a week after receiving the script.\n \n(Submitted by David Carver Entertainment)\nNorris:\n Who did you speak to research the story for this film?\nCarver:\n Gus Maui and Ernie Hauser were very generous with their time as well as Marie, Moe's twin sister. I was fortunate enough to interview her before she died and she had just fascinating stories about Moe.\nBut Gus and Ernie, clearly Moe's two best friends, they have a lot of golf stories and every now and then they sneak in something that's really more about his life and his journey. And from all of that and other people that they linked me up with, [they] had some amazing interviews.\nNorris:\n How do you think this is going to be different from other golf movies that have been made?\nCarver: \n\u00a0My philosophy going in was, Moe was different.\u00a0And I didn't want to make\u00a0\u2014\u00a0no offence to any other sports movie\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but I didn't want to make a cookie cutter sports movie where there's a disconnection between a parent and a child.\u00a0\nEventually the child grows up and becomes an incredible athlete and wins some games and then the parent comes and there's a reconciliation at the end and everybody hugs it out and everybody cries.\u00a0\nI just didn't want to do that because it's not factual. And because Moe is different, I wanted to tell a different story.\u00a0\nMeet Canada's Moe Norman: Golf's misunderstood genius\nVideo\nGolfer Moe Norman does it his way\nWe don't have that big scene at the end where Moe wins from the tournament and everybody hugs it out.\nHis journey is more again about the life lessons off the golf course, which is why we have the tagline. It's not about golf, it's about life. And I think people that don't play golf will connect with the story.\u00a0\nPart of the reason why we love Bruce Beresford as our director is, put aside the fact that he makes\u00a0incredible films, a lot of attention to detail in the period piece, and put aside the fact that he pulls award nominating performances out of his actors and if you look back at most of the movies he's done, someone's always seemed to be getting an award nomination or win.\nBut put aside all that, he doesn't play golf and I thought that it would be beneficial to have someone visually telling the story who doesn't play the sport.\u00a0Because when you're advocating, it's not about golf. So we want people who either don't play golf or actually hate golf to go to the theater and they're gonna get an experience that's not about golf.\nWork on the film 'The Place I Belong: The Moe Norman Story' is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2024. \n \n(Submitted by David Carver Entertainment)\nNorris:\n When do you start filming?\nCarver:\n We are aiming for the spring of 2024 and it's sort of a bit of back story on the logistics of making a movie.\nWe have Bruce Beresford kind of on hold from January 2024 through to the end of the summer 2024. So in that window once we determine who our actors are going to be and when they are available as well as you know where we're going to shoot the film, then we can pick a time period starting January 2024 through the end of the summer.\nVeteran golfer Moe Norman of Gilford, Ontario, walks off the 18th green at Board of Trade Country Club at Woodridge, near Toronto, Sept. 15, 1968. When it comes to winning over Canadian golfers, it helps to know someone.

        "summary": "The Region of Waterloo Paramedic Service plans to implement a new Fit 2 Sit program this fall that will speed up the process of transferring patients to hospital if those patients can safely wait for care in a hospital\u2019s waiting room.",
        "content": "The Region of Waterloo Paramedic Service plans to implement a new Fit 2 Sit program this fall that will speed up the process of transferring patients to hospital if those patients can safely wait for care in a hospital's waiting room.\nThe initiative is part of a series of efforts aimed at reducing the amount of time paramedics are delayed at the Grand River, St. Mary's General and Cambridge Memorial hospitals and increasing the availability of ambulances in the community, said John Riches, the chief of the region's paramedic service.\nParamedic services across the province have been struggling to respond to ballooning call volumes, an increase in the severity of patients' conditions and longer offload times at hospitals, according to a\n 2020 CUPE report\n \u2014 all of which have contributed to what the Region of Waterloo service calls \"code reds,\" periods of time when there are no ambulances available to respond to calls.\u00a0\nWhile the number of code reds dropped to 38 in the first half of 2023 from 59 during the same period last year, the number of hours spent in code red actually climbed to nearly 17 from just over 15.\u00a0\n\"The number of times that code reds or code yellows occur is still deeply concerning,\" Riches said, despite the drop in the number of incidents.\u00a0 \n\"Nobody wants there to be no paramedics available to respond to calls in the community. Nobody wants that situation.\"\nJohn Riches is the chief of paramedic services for the Region of Waterloo. He said code reds remain a concern even if the number of code red events dropped slightly between early 2022 and early 2023. \n \n(John Riches/Linkedin)\nParamedics already transfer some patients from ambulances into hospital waiting rooms, Riches said.\u00a0\nFit 2 Sit will establish a formal process for doing so, which will cut down the time involved, he added.\nIt will also clearly spell out the criteria for who can and cannot be left unattended to wait for care.\nFit 2 Sit programs commonly require patients to be alert and\u00a0able to sit or stand, and to have vital signs in normal ranges.\u00a0They exclude patients whose conditions rank high on the Canadian Triage Acuity Scale (CTAS).\nThe paramedic service plans to monitor the time it spends transferring patients to hospital waiting rooms before and after it implements Fit 2 Sit to assess how well the program works, Riches said.\u00a0\nIt will also look at patient outcomes.\nFit 2 Sit only part of the solution\u00a0\n\"Us and our hospital partners are committed to changing the program\u00a0if we need to,\" Riches said.\u00a0\n\"Maybe that change might be broadening who's eligible for Fit 2 Sit, or it might be narrowing it, depending on, you know, what the metrics are telling us.\"\nThe paramedic service is also looking at other options to improve ambulance availability, Riches said.\u00a0\nIt would like to see an alternative destination clinic designated\u00a0in the community so that paramedics can take those suffering mental health and addictions-related issues somewhere other than a hospital.\nRiches said he also hopes that changes to the province's call priority algorithms will make it easier to separate true emergencies from situations where patients can wait longer for assistance.\u00a0\nThe Guelph Wellington Paramedic Service implemented Fit 2 Sit in 2019 with Guelph General Hospital said Leanne Swantko, the service's deputy chief.\nProgram a success even if numbers don't show it\nIt rolled it out to three other area hospitals last year.\nSwantko said\u00a0the program has been a success.\n\"It doesn't have a big dent in the overall code red and offload scenarios,\" she said of Fit 2 Sit.\u00a0\n\"But when we're looking at one patient at a time, some nights, you know, one ambulance is available, and that's all we have. It does make a significant difference for a community that we're able to implement the Fit 2 Sit program.\"\nEven with the program in place,\u00a0the\u00a0paramedic service failed to meet a single 2022 response time target in its response time performance plan, mandated by\u00a0the Ontario Ministry of Health.\nSwantko blames that on\u00a0an array of factors including higher call volumes, sicker patients, and staffing shortages at the hospital, which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0\nSo far, just under 500 patients have been transferred to hospital waiting rooms under Guelph's Fit 2 Sit program.\u00a0\nOf those, five subsequently saw their conditions deteriorate, Swantko\u00a0said.\u00a0\n'It's working fantastic'\nThe Sault Ste-Marie paramedic service has posted similar statistics since implementing Fit 2 Sit\u00a0with the Sault Area Hospital in April of last year.\nParamedics have diverted around 475 patients to the hospital's triage area, according to Dan Langevin, the deputy chief of the paramedic service.\nLess than five subsequently saw their conditions deteriorate.\u00a0\n\"I think it's working fantastic,\" Langevin said.\n\"Paramedics have been doing this for a long time. It just wasn't an official program\u00a0\u2026 They would go up to the charge nurse and say, 'You know what? This patient really doesn't need the emerge right now. They could go and sit in the waiting room.' And so they would make a collaborative decision on that. And so that takes time too, because that nurse is busy doing other things. So having the established inclusion and exclusion criteria \u2026 there is no discussion. There's no, you know, time wasted that way.\"\u00a0\nFit 2 Sit was part of a series of initiatives the paramedic service implemented to bring down their offload wait times at the hospital, said paramedic\u00a0chief, Kate Kirkham.\nOthers included working with the hospital to ensure there is always a nurse or paramedic dedicated to offloading patients at the facility; having one team of paramedics care for up to four patients in the hospital cue; diverting patients with addiction-related issues to detox, and increasing the use of a private company for non-urgent patient transfers such as transfers to routine appointments.\u00a0\nThe number of code reds\u00a0dropped from 227 in 2021 to 170 in 2022 to just 15 in the first quarter of 2023, according to data supplied by Kirkham.\u00a0\nThe number of times that an urgent call has been delayed as a result,has dropped from 51 and 54 in 2021 and 2022 respectively to nine in the first quarter of 2023.",

        "content": "Local agencies working with refugee claimants in Waterloo region say their clients are in urgent need of more assistance\u00a0and call for all levels of government\u00a0work together to co-ordinate and provide better supports.\u00a0\nLast week, the federal government announced $212 million in funding to help Toronto, Ottawa and the Province of Quebec to help them fund an interim housing assistance program to help with an influx of asylum seekers.\nBut it's not just a big city problem, local groups say.\n\"What we saw in Toronto was absolutely devastating, but we've seen it building,\"\u00a0Lucia Harrison, CEO of the\u00a0K-W Multicultural\u00a0Centre, told CBC News.\n\"We need the federal government, the provincial government and municipalities to come together on this and look at not only the situation\u00a0today, but longer-term strategies.\"\nThe K-W Multicultural\u00a0Centre and Compass Refugee Centre are the only agencies in Waterloo region that specifically work with refugee claimants, or\u00a0asylum seekers, to provide services and supports like housing, employment and also help with refugee hearing preparations and permanent residency.\nLast week, the Ontario Big City Mayors caucus, which includes mayors from Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, released a statement calling for more financial funds form the federal government so that municipalities and agencies can help asylum seekers as they settle.\nThe statement\u00a0came\u00a0after dozens of refugees claimants\u00a0in Toronto slept outside\u00a0because of a \nlack of housing and adequate shelter space\n in the city.\nHarrison, who is also\u00a0co-chair of the region's\u00a0refugee task force,\u00a0said the crisis in Toronto hasn't happened in Waterloo region yet, but as\u00a0more refugee claimants come to the region, she fears\u00a0it may happen soon.\nShe said there have been\u00a0times when some refugee claimants\u00a0have had to access the region's shelter system\u00a0or\u00a0have had to couch surf for a period of time before they're able to\u00a0finding housing.\n\"Housing is a crisis for everyone, so finding accommodations is difficult,\u00a0processes are difficult [and]\u00a0finding all the appropriate services, which at the moment most are centralized in Toronto,\" she said.\n\"We're not there yet, but ... we're not too far from having people sleeping on the streets here who are refugee claimants.\"\nBacklogged system\nShelley Campagnola, executive director of Compass Refugee says the number of refugee claimants coming to the region range from 60 to 70 on average every month and they're coming from 38 countries. Harrison said that number has gone\u00a0up to 80 people at times.\nHarrison and Campagnola said their organizations are seeing\u00a0refugee claimants\u00a0come\u00a0from areas like Mexico lately, landing on direct flights at the Region of Waterloo International Airport.\nShelley Campagnola is the Executive Director of Compass Refugee Centre in Kitchener. Her organization and the K-W Multicultural are the only agencies in the region working with refugee claimants.\n \n(Submitted by Shelley Campagnola)\nCampagnola\u00a0added\u00a0refugee claimants coming to Canada can wait up to a year for the government\u00a0to acknowledge their claim. In that time she says, refugee claimants don't have access to work, child care benefits\u00a0or\u00a0access health care,\u00a0which means they can't house or\u00a0support themselves.\nOnce they're in the system, it can take up to four years to be granted refugee status, she said.\n\"If they're granted that, they can apply for\u00a0permanent residency status and it's at that point that that they become eligible for many of the services that would help them in the day to day, so what we have is a\u00a0completely backlogged system,\" Campagnola said.\nRefugee claimants also\u00a0don't have access to the same supports as government assisted refugees. Harrison said her organization, for example,\u00a0receives funding from Immigration Refugee Citizenship Canada\u00a0to provide services to government-assisted refugees, but they can't use that money to support asylum seekers.\nCBC Explains\nAsylum seekers and refugees \u2014 what's the difference?\n\"We need to find other funding to provide services to claimants and that's where we\u00a0in the settlement sector are seeing as so unfair,\" she said. \"A claimant has all the same needs as a government-assisted refugee coming into the community.\"\u00a0\nThe province does provide some funding to K-W Multicultural for that work, but they need to split it to also serve migrant workers and international students, Harrison said.\nCampagnola said her organization receives\u00a0no funding form any level of government and solely rely on fundraising and donations.\nCities need to be at the table\nPart of the Ontario Big City Mayors statement on July 18\u00a0also called for the federal government to consult with municipalities. A\u00a0co-ordinated\u00a0approach is needed to make sure new Canadians\u00a0get the supports they need, Kitchener Mayor Berry Vrbanovic said.\n\"Really what we're looking for is two things: one, is the funding to support\u00a0new Canadians, whether they are coming in as immigrants or refugees and number two, sitting down at the table with us so that we can co-ordinate the overall numbers coming into a community and making sure the necessary supports and resources are there to meet their needs,\" Vrbanovic told CBC News.\nAudio\nChanging face of a community: How the K-W Multicultural Centre has helped newcomers settle in Waterloo region\nWaterloo Mayor Dorothy McCabe said having municipalities at the table when the federal governments is making immigration targets\u00a0helps the city\u00a0plan\u00a0their services and gives staff\u00a0a sense of what to expect.\nMcCabe added the federal government also needs to accelerate work permits for refugees so they can access work in a timely manner.\n\"When immigrants and refugees come, they want to work, they want to integrate,\" she said. \"That's something the federal government needs to address as well.\"\nThe shortage of shelter beds in Toronto for refugee claimants has\u00a0prompted\u00a0calls \nto speed up work permits from other advocates\n\u00a0and \nToronto Mayor Olivia Chow and Ontario Premier Doug Ford\n.\nCampagnola\u00a0said\u00a0the federal government needs to properly resource\u00a0\"the whole refugee claim system.\" She says one of the main challenges is that the system caps how many people can be completely process each year, which guarantees a backlog, she said.\u00a0\nHow faster work permits could help ease Canada's refugee shelter crisis\nIn a statement to CBC News, Kitchener-Conestoga MP Tim Louis said the federal government \"recognizes there is a need for all levels of government to work together on solutions to address the current and future needs for asylum claimants and refugees\u00a0who chose to make Waterloo region their home.\"\n\"My office is in contact with local settlement organizations discussing the challenges they are facing, and the supports they need,\" Louis said.\n\"We\u00a0continue to advocate for\u00a0more\u00a0support for the region to assist with the important work settlement services do every day in our community.\"",

        "content": "What On Earth\n21:05\nFarmer\u2019s Island\nAfter being ordered to remove livestock from his backyard in rural Newfoundland and Labrador, Frank Brown fights outdated legislation that researchers and other farmers say are counterproductive to N.L\u2019s fight against food insecurity.\nJust weeks after Frank Brown \nwas ordered to remove all the farm animals\n from his property in the rural community of Summerford, N.L., he's at the Gander International Airport picking up more animals: 1,200 chirping chicks that sing a high-pitched song and garner looks from travellers as they're wheeled out of the airport.\nThese day-old turkeys, pheasants and chickens \u2014 cute for now, says Brown \u2014 arrived in cargo crates from Ontario, and will be sold to residents in nearby communities, where they'll live in backyard chicken coops and eventually become meat and egg producers.\n\"There's a demand in central Newfoundland, on the coastlines, for eggs that we cannot meet,\" said Brown, owner of Larissa's Farm and Hatchery, located in Summerford, a coastal community\u00a0about 400 kilometres northwest of St. John's.\n\"People want fresh, they want local and they want stuff they know where it came from\u00a0\u2014\u00a0not off a shelf in a grocery store that's a month old.\"\nBrown and a young customer handle day-old chickens, turkeys and pheasants for their small farm operation in Summerford, N.L. Homesteading of any kind is technically not permitted in most towns in Newfoundland and Labrador.\n \n(Caroline Hillier/CBC)\nThe trouble with Brown's business plan is that backyard chickens \u2014 or homesteading of any kind \u2014 is technically not permitted in most towns in Newfoundland and Labrador. But farming advocates are pressuring the province to change that, citing backyard farming as a fix to the province's food insecurity problem and a way to prevent municipal kerfuffles, like the one Brown is currently in.\nNic Fairbridge, a researcher and farming advocate, did \nan exhaustive review\n of provincial and municipal regulations related to agriculture in Newfoundland and Labrador. He found that outdated standards \u2014 based on the archaic pre-confederation 1947 Agriculture Act of the U.K. \u2014 are restricting farmers and hampering efforts to promote food security and food equity.\n\"The way it's written in that kind of legalese jargon \u2026 it ends up blocking every fruit tree, every raised bed and everyone,\" said Fairbridge.\nAlthough the regulations exist, not all communities enforce the restrictions.\nNic Fairbridge, a researcher and farming advocate, said the provincial and municipal regulations governing agriculture in Newfoundland and Labrador are based on archaic rules that pre-date the province joining Confederation.\n \n(Caroline Hillier/CBC)\n\"When one person in the community perhaps takes it too far or there's a complaint that comes in, once the council is aware of the issues, they then have to act,\" said Fairbridge. \"They're held to uphold those regulations.\"\nHe says it's not uncommon for municipalities across Canada to struggle with the legalities and logistics of people who want to keep livestock in residential areas.\nN.L.'s food insecurity issue\nHowever, in Newfoundland and Labrador, there are \nhigh rates of food insecurity\n. According to Food First N.L., a provincial, non-profit organization concentrating on food insecurity, there are a variety of issues contributing to the problem. The province has the \nfewest farms\n in the country and there's a limited supply of produce at any given time because of ferry delays. Also, many communities don't have a standard grocery store.\u00a0\n\"We ship in most of our food,\" said Fairbridge. \"Labrador is rural and remote. Newfoundland itself is an island. So we're very reliant on large shipping lanes that are disrupted through things like \nSnowmageddon\n or other issues.\"\nBrown, right, is seen here with his partner, Seane Rowsell.\n \n(Caroline Hillier/CBC)\nAs the climate changes, experts predict that Newfoundland and Labrador will experience more extreme weather events that can cause road blockages and ferry delays, preventing food from getting to its final destination.\nFood First N.L. notes that just over 13 per cent of households in the province are considered food insecure, meaning they don't have ready access to enough food due to financial constraints.\nCharities offering hot meals grapple with shrinking donations \u2014 and soaring demand\nN.L. Human Rights Commission drops walk-in clients as demand rises for food, housing\nThe provincial government has made a commitment to become more self-reliant when it comes to food, and says it's \nmet its goal of doubling commercial food production in the past five years.\nBrown feeds the goats on his property, Larissa's Farm and Hatchery, which is not in a designated agricultural area.\n \n(Caroline Hillier/CBC)\nUrgent call for new food planning policy\u00a0\nFairbridge says the current legislation around municipal farming is counterproductive to the province's plan to grow more local food.\nFairbridge and farming advocates with the Killick Coast Agricultural Advisory Committee recently urged the province to amend the Urban and Rural Planning Act.\nIn a July\u00a018 email to Premier Andrew Furey and various departments, the group wrote that \"inconsistent interpretation and enforcement of municipal plans, bylaws and financial penalties are interfering with food production and creating conflict within municipalities.\"\nConflict certainly ensued in Summerford after orders to remove animals went out in May this year \u2014 protests, the resignation of five town councillors and then a byelection that attracted a record 19 people who put their names on the ballot.\nBrown addresses Town of Summerford council members at a meeting June 6 about the municipal bylaws impacting his farm operation.\n \n(Caroline Hillier/CBC)\nAt the June 6 town council meeting, Brown attended and spoke about why he's appealing the order.\n\"This is rural Newfoundland. This was really what these communities was built around: fishing and farming,\" Brown told council. He noted that he would not be removing the 100 sheep, 10 goats, turkeys, rooster, hens and rescue donkey from his property.\nEnd of school means end to hot meals for food-insecure students, says St. John's principal\nA hydroponic harvest in this Labrador classroom is teaching kids about food security\nThe town council of Summerford refused multiple interview requests, but during that June 6 meeting, Mayor Kevin Barnes put it simply: the current town plan does not allow livestock within town limits, and writing a new town plan will cost taxpayers.\n\"We had to do what we had to do. And that's not saying that there's nothing going to change \u2026 but we got to go through a process in order to change the town plan. Plain and simple as that,\" he said.\nChicks for sale\nAn official with the Town of Summerford said there had been complaints related to odours and animals getting loose.\nBut those complaints don't faze Brown, who says his farm isn't just a way of life, but a way to produce his own food.\n\"We take most of what we eat from the water or off the land that we farm,\" he said, allowing that they only go to the store for basics like flour or salt.\n\"I don't buy any meats from the store. I don't buy no eggs. I don't buy no vegetables.\"\nSome of 1,200 day-old chicks collected by Brown at the Gander International Airport for his small farming operation located in a residential area. He also sells them to other locals who wish to have their own birds for eggs and meat.\n \n(Caroline Hillier/CBC)\nDespite the municipal restrictions, Brown is not only adding more animals to his backyard farm \u2014 he's selling them to others, too.\nAfter Brown and the 1,200 chicks make the hour drive to Summerford in the back of a pickup truck, he puts the word out: These chicks are for sale.\nGreenhouses aim to bring fresh produce to North, putting a dent in food insecurity\nN.B. has second-highest rate of food insecurity of 10 provinces\nIt's not long before people from Summerford and neighbouring communities are lining up outside Brown's chicken coop, holding cardboard boxes poked with holes, waiting to be filled with chirping chicks.\nThere's excitement and talk about the controversy in town around backyard animals, but buyers don't seem worried about municipalities not approving of the new additions that will soon be pecking and clucking in their backyards.\n'Guidance document' in the works\nIn an emailed statement sent to the\u00a0CBC on Friday, Newfoundland and Labrador's Department of Municipal and Provincial Affairs said municipalities have the ability to zone lands for agriculture uses, and to enable home gardening where councils deem it appropriate.\n\"Councils have the authority to create land use planning regulations and to make amendments to these,\" it read.\nIn a separate emailed statement sent earlier in the week, Newfoundland and Labrador's Department of Fisheries, Forestry and Agriculture said that it supports small-scale agriculture and efforts to increase food self-sufficiency, and is currently working on a \"guidance document\" to help municipalities develop regulations and bylaws around agriculture.\n\"The document will outline acceptable farm production practices, and animal husbandry and environmental protection requirements.\"\nThe statement also explains that communities with approved municipal plans have control of development within town limits.\nTwo of Brown's goats are seen behind a fence on the property.\n \n(Caroline Hillier/CBC)\nIn communities with \"productive farmland,\" where farming isn't common, the department said it would work closely with the municipality to encourage inclusion of agriculture when the municipal plan is renewed.\nSoaring food costs are making it harder for kids across Canada to eat a healthy meal at school\nBrown isn't waiting for any changes to legislation before he grows his farm. His chicks sold out, so he says he plans on ordering more, and is even looking into getting some cows.\n\"The only way those animals is leaving here is over my dead body,\" said Brown.",

As is she.\nThe Ottawa couple \u2014 both retired federal public servants in their mid-sixties \u2014 used to live an active life, travelling the world before Fairhead lost function in\u00a0most of his right side after a stroke eight years ago.\nBut Sullivan believes what little mobility he still has would not have been possible without years of intensive physiotherapy, something she says will now be reduced significantly after the government of Canada made \na series of changes to the country's largest health insurance plan\n\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the Public Service Health Care Plan (PSHCP).\nFrustration abounds as public service health plan gets switched to Canada Life\n\"Without the physio, what's going to happen is his body is going to atrophy,\" she said.\n\"What I'm really worried about is he's going to get to the point where he won't be able to do anything on his own and I will be left doing all the things that he can now do.\"\nSullivan and Fairhead are among the 1.7 million federal workers, retirees and dependents who saw their insurance provider switch from Sun Life to Canada Life on July 1, and with it changes to what services and drugs are covered, how they're approved and what happens when they need to talk to an agent.\u00a0\nGender-affirming care boosted in new federal worker health plan\nThe Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), which oversees labour relations between the federal government and the public sector, said changes made to the PSHCP, including claim limits, coverage terms and eligibility, were approved in the fall of 2022 \u2014 independent of the switch to Canada Life.\u00a0\nThose changes came into effect after Canada Life won a tender to administer the plan.\nStill, CBC News has heard from dozens of members who say they're frustrated by both the government and the insurance provider.\u00a0\nLouise Sullivan worries that her husband, Michael Fairhead, pictured here, will regress without continued intensive physiotherapy, something she can no longer afford under the Public Service Health Care Plan's coverage changes.\n \n(Jean Delisle/CBC)\nIn Fairhead's case, coverage for his physiotherapy used to be practically unlimited.\nUnder the previous terms, the couple was covered at 80 per cent for claims up to\u00a0$500 and claims over $1,000.\nNow, it's capped at $1,500 annually.\u00a0\nThe cost for his physiotherapy last year was more than\u00a0$14,000, according to Sullivan.\nIn response to the new cap, Sullivan said\u00a0she's made the difficult decision to cut his physiotherapy from three days a week to once a week at most.\nWhile she plans to help him with whatever exercise she can, she knows she won't be able to make up for the difference.\u00a0\n\"That's my biggest fear is that he's going to get to the point where he's going to be so sore and so stiff that he won't even want to get out of bed and that will devastate me,\" she said.\nDrug coverage confusion\nAlong with coverage limits, the new plan dictates people must choose generic drugs.\nBeverley Cormier, 59, recently switched to a new medication to help with flare-ups for her rheumatoid arthritis. Under her husband's plan, the first month was covered at 80 per cent by Sun Life, but when the next 30 days were set to go through, she learned from the drug's maker, Pfizer, that it had been declined by Canada Life.\n\"It's really hard how you can explain to people how one day you feel really good and then the next day you can hardly move and this medication was making such a big difference in such a short amount of time,\" she said, her voice cracking.\nThat medication comes with a $1,700 a month price tag.\n \nI've maxed out my credit cards paying for the little medication that I do have right now.\n- Susan Judges, plan member\nCormier had only been on the medication for a month before the terms of the plan changed.\nHer husband, Norm Cormier \u2014 a veteran who worked for the military for 27 years \u2014 contemplated coming out of retirement to find another job.\nNot being able to get through to an agent at Canada Life\u00a0after being denied twice for the medication compounded the frustration.\nCanada Life has since covered the drug\u00a0after CBC\u00a0asked Treasury Board President Mona Fortier's office about it.\u00a0The TBS told CBC the medication\u00a0requires prior approval.\n\"When it's your medication and you're suffering, you just want somebody to tell you something,\"\u00a0Beverley Cormier said.\nShe did suffer.\nBecause of the delay getting the medication approved, she went 10 days without it, resulting in a debilitating flare-up.\nSusan Judges, 52, is also eligible for the plan because her husband is a veteran. She\u00a0had to pay hundreds of dollars out of pocket\u00a0for\u00a0medications before problems with her plan were resolved earlier this month.\nDespite calling four to five times a day since the switchover\u00a0and sending emails,\u00a0it took weeks before anyone from the company responded.\nLouise Sullivan tries to assist her husband, Michael Fairhead, with some of his daily exercises. The struggle to get out of his wheelchair and shuffle a few metres might as well be a marathon \u2014 one she fears he'll lose the ability to even attempt.\n \n(Jean Delisle/CBC)\n\"I feel like we fell through the cracks,\" she told CBC.\nYet, she still faces weeks before being reimbursed the $300 because of ongoing problems with their enrolment\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a decision between paying for food or medication.\n\"I've maxed out my credit cards paying for the little medication that I do have right now,\" said Judges.\nThe multitude of worries and frustrations are ones Roy Goodall has heard over the last few weeks.\n\"It's a terrible situation,\" said the president of the National Association of Federal Retirees.\u00a0\"I don't envy the people who are faced with this.\"\nHe said the association plans to address the cap on physio coverage\u00a0with the government when there's a review of coverage in two years.\nIn the meantime, he's also heard from people who are frustrated with not being able to get through to an agent and being forced to do much of the enrolment or claims online when they're not technologically savvy.\n\"I understand that a lot of people are stressed, they're angry and they're frustrated that they're unable to reach anybody.\"\n \nThere are faces behind all of these numbers and decisions that they make and that real people are having their life affected to a very deep degree and I personally think it's appalling.\n- Louise Sullivan, retired federal public servant\nCanada Life said\u00a0it appreciates people's patience while it tries to deal with longer wait times to get through to an agent.\nIt blamed the higher call volume on those needing help enrolling in the plan, but said it's working with the government to help members have quicker access to their benefits and increasing call centre capacity to reduce wait times.\nThe company also urged members to contact pharmacies with their new Canada Life benefit card information to cut down on the number of claims being rejected.\nSusan Judges has maxed out her credit cards filling some prescriptions week by week as she waits to hear from Canada Life about what's happening with her coverage.\n \n(Submitted by Susan Judges)\nTBS says changes mean greater access for more members\nTBS said it continues to press Canada Life to come up with solutions to meet current call demands.\nIt pointed out prescription drug coverage is still reimbursed at 80 per cent, but a new $8 cap on pharmacy dispensing fees and a requirement for people to choose generic drugs\u00a0means expanded benefits in other areas, including mental health, mobility devices and laser eye surgery.\nIt applied the same logic to the physiotherapy portion of the plan \u2014 by introducing a $1,500 annual cap, TBS was able to remove a barrier that had previously made some lower cost claims ineligible.\nTBS said it had also\u00a0tried to reach plan members in various ways ahead of the transition, including through the Annual Pensioners Statement and social media.\nThe Treasury Board Secretariat says it continues to press Canada Life to come up with solutions to meet current call demands.\n \n(Don Pittis/CBC)\nSullivan understands how the change would likely provide access for more people, but she feels seniors with chronic conditions are being abandoned.\n\"For the majority of people, this is not an issue, But we are an aging population. Older people's limbs break a lot; 10 sessions is not going to help you recover,\" she said.\n\"There are faces behind all of these numbers and decisions that they make and that real people are having their life affected to a very deep degree and I personally think it's appalling.\"\nCBC reached out to both the Conservative and NDP health critics.\u00a0\nNDP\u00a0Hamilton-Centre MP Matthew Green, who is\u00a0deputy labour critic, called the move \"alarming\" and \"unconscionable.\"\nGreen said he's concerned for families who are on fixed incomes.\n\"This feels a lot like a bait and switch by this federal government,\" he said.",

        "content": "The Sunday Magazine\n19:01\nRelishing the cultural and historical impact of hot dogs with Jamie Loftus\nWriter and comedian Jamie Loftus has, in her own words, been \"obsessed\" with a video about how hot dogs are made since she was in college.\nThe five-minute video, \ntaken from a 2008 episode of the show\n How It's Made\n, details the factory process of turning scraps of meat into the eight-packs of wieners seen everywhere in North America from school lunchrooms to baseball stadiums.\nIn one shot, pink-grey emulsified meat \u2014\u00a0spiked with spices, water and corn syrup \u2014\u00a0oozes out of a metal pipe, looking more like soft-serve ice cream.\n\"It's funny to me because it is the best possible, most flattering way to show how a hot dog is made, and it's still absolutely disgusting,\" she told \nThe Sunday Magazine's\n guest host Megan Williams.\nLoftus travelled the United States in 2021 to learn more about the hot dog, including tasting dozens of regional variations, for her book \nRaw Dog: The Naked Truth About Hot Dogs\n.\nJamie Loftus is the author of Raw Dog: The Naked Truth About Hot Dogs.\n \n(Tor Publishing Group)\nOn the outside, she says the hot dog is an iconic dish that exemplifies the ingenuity and individualism of the United States; on the other, its continued popularity and affordability is only possible thanks to the dark side of capitalism.\n\"There just wasn't a lot written about the history of hot dogs that also acknowledged the labour exploitation that's necessary in order for hot dogs to exist,\" she said. \"So I \u2026 jumped on the opportunity to punish my body with as many hot dogs as possible.\"\nThe sausage is industrialized\nLoftus said that for many, hot dogs are associated with a working, lower-to-middle class due to their historically low price and easy preparation.\n\"It endures because it is still possible for basically everyone to have access to it, which is kind of rare for any kind of famous food,\" she said.\nThat's thanks in no small part to how the dogs are mass-produced and distributed, she noted.\nCustomers wait in line to order below signage for the Costco Kirkland Signature $1.50 US hot dog and soda combo, which has maintained the same price since 1985 despite consumer price increases and inflation, at the food court outside a Costco store on June 14, 2022 in Hawthorne, Calif.\n \n(Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images)\n\"The industrialization happens in the 1930s, and it comes through \u2026 emulsification, which is basically just taking meat and blending it into a paste and then pumping it into artificial casings,\" said Jeffrey Pilcher, a professor of history and food studies at the University of Toronto.\nThat process helps set it apart from traditional sausages, and shares many techniques that\u00a0made other\u00a0items like fish sticks and \nchicken nuggets\n possible, Pilcher said.\nTheir accessibility and affordability, however, is largely\u00a0thanks to low-wage workers manning the factories that make them, said Loftus.\nA 2022 report by ProPublica\n found evidence that then-U.S. president Donald Trump's administration worked directly with the heads of Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods \u2014 makers of Ball Park Franks and Nathan's Famous hot dogs, respectively \u2014 to issue\u00a0an executive order allowing the plants to remain open during COVID-19,\u00a0ostensibly in the patriotic interest of feeding the American public.\n\"The CEOs were basically sending copy for this executive order so that they could continue to, you know, profit at astronomical rates while doing absolutely nothing to protect their employees,\" said Loftus.\nTrump orders U.S. meat-processing plants to stay open despite coronavirus fears\nAs Trump moves to keep meat-processing plants open, Trudeau stresses workers' safety\nAccording to another report\n, processing plants owned by the U.S.'s five largest meat companies accounted for\u00a059,000 COVID-19 cases and 269 deaths among workers between March 2020 and February 2021 alone.\nLoftus argues that the hot dog's status as a uniquely American food\u00a0buoyed public support for keeping the plants open despite the risk.\n\"All of these nostalgic, kind of childhood meals had a huge comeback during lockdown because of, I think, how desperate people were to feel something familiar and feel some comfort,\" she said.\nAll-beef origin stories\nThe patriotism behind hot dogs in the U.S. is ironic, Loftus said, since the dish traces its earliest origins to sausage-making in Europe. Immigrants from places like Germany and Poland brought their food traditions with them; eventually they would cross with mass industrialization to produce the \"uniquely North American nightmare fuel\" that is the modern hot dog on a bun.\n\"Most hot dogs that you eat wouldn't be possible, really, without the industrial process and all of these sort of ethical quandaries that come with it,\" she said.\nAs for how exactly the classic hot-dog-and-bun combo came to be, it's hard to say.\nLoftus\u00a0says she researched competing origin stories and usually found a mix of marketing campaigns and fabrications, most centred\u00a0on \"one man's exceptionalism\" of having the idea before anyone else.\n\"There's a million versions of that story. None of them are true. They all are kind of fun,\" she said.\nWATCH:\u00a0This man eats 62 hot dogs:\n \nJoey Chestnut eats 62 hot dogs to claim 16th Mustard Belt\n21 days ago\nDuration \n1:34\nJoey \"Jaws\" Chestnut ate 62 hot dogs and buns to win his eighth-straight Mustard Belt and 16th overall at the 2023 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.\nShe ran into other marketing-fuelled myths, such as the genesis of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, where competitors scarf down dogs at a breakneck pace every July 4.\nThe company once touted that it began in the 1920s as an impromptu dare between immigrants on how much they could eat in one sitting \u2014 as proof of \"Who is the most American?\" Loftus said.\nIn reality, she says, it began as a promotional event in the early 1970s.\nWorking class? Not always\nThe working-class association people have with an affordable hot dog or other fast foods isn't as longstanding as one might believe, either, Pilcher said, noting that going to a baseball game and eating a hot dog while in the stands was\u00a0a leisure-time activity that many people couldn't afford.\n\"So you know, these class associations certainly change over time,\" he said.\nMohammed Hussein works at his hot dog vending cart in New York's Times Square, on April 27, 2021.\n \n(Mary Altaffer/The Associated Press)\nAfter unravelling the history and unsavoury truths about hot dogs' place in the modern food industry, Loftus says she actively encourages people to seek out dogs and sausages made locally and ethically, and to avoid those made by Tyson and Smithfield Foods, specifically.\nBut she admits the adventure hasn't turned her off the food entirely \u2014 which came as a surprise even to her.\nHer favourite from her cross-country road trip? The ripper, a dog popularized by Rutt's Hut in New Jersey that is deep fried until the casing snaps open.\n\"It's on the side of the highway in Jersey.

I love the staff there,\" said Mcneal.\n \n \"It's absolutely astronomical, what they do for people in the community.\"\n \n If the project goes forward, both Mcneal and Gould said they would move.\u00a0\nBut, not all residents in Sherwood Park oppose the project.\u00a0\nMultiple parents\u00a0voiced support for the new build at a 13-hour council meeting in February, saying the club's programing had been invaluable to their children and would like to see it expanded.\nWhy Brentwood?\nLast year, the federal government announced the Green and Inclusive Community Buildings program. If approved, the grant\u00a0would cover 60 per cent of construction costs for the new BGC building, estimated to be $10 million.\n \n To apply, BGC Strathcona County needed a site ready and\u00a0settled the site in the\u00a0Brentwood\u00a0neighbourhood because the land could be donated by the county and the location is near\u00a0playgrounds, parks, sports fields, transit and walking paths.\u00a0\n \n \"We truly believe that the new building will have a net positive impact on the community as a whole and we're really committed to being a good neighbour,\" said Alison Ottewell, president of the board for BGC Strathcona County.\u00a0\n'It saved our lives in one sense': How BGC Dawson helps Verdun families \nAs rents soar, tenants organize local protests. But what's needed for a national housing movement? \nPushback from local residents is not surprising, said Rod Frank, mayor of Strathcona County.\u00a0\n\u00a0\"People take a real interest in their neighbourhoods. Many have been there for a long time,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We've seen this before and we understand.\"\nThere are few other options in the community, where the county could donate the land for the project, said Frank.\u00a0\nBGC Strathcona County expects to hear if it gets the grant by the end of the year. If successful, it will move to the next planning and development stage. If unsuccessful. Ottewell said, it will be much more difficult to finance the project.\n\"We again are going to have to continue adding to our ever-growing wait-list for children and youth.\"\u00a0",

The tradition has always been for doctors to hire scribes for freelance transcription work.\u00a0\n\"No one has adopted the technological approach until more recently,\" he said. \"There's a lot of barriers.\"\nWith Scribeberry as an option, Moloo said he has been considering going back into family practice with a smaller patient load.\u00a0\n\"I know for a fact if there was something like this when I was in practice, I probably wouldn't have left.\"\u00a0",

        "content": "This First Person article is the experience of Colin MacKenzie, a filmmaker in Montreal. For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see \nthe FAQ\n.\nAs a kid, I remember lying across the seat of a white rowboat in the hot sun during my summer holidays.\nMy grandmother lived on a small lake surrounded by pine trees and chickadees in the Laurentians. I was fishing for perch, or anything really. But I can probably count on one hand how many fish I actually landed between the ages of four and 16.\nMaybe only one or two of them were big enough to bring home, clean, fry up and eat.\nIn 2006, what seemed like a lifetime later, I was having one of my first quick chats with my future brother-in-law, on the weekend that he and my sister Kathy were getting married. We were standing on the steps of a small white church in the town of Shigawake, Que., people around us helping get things ready for the big day.\nMichael Sullivan is a lobster fisherman. Wearing his preferred black ball cap and sporting a chevron mustache, he catches enough lobster and fish to make a living.\nMichael's eyes twinkled when he explained the ins and outs of his craft. His family tree takes him back to Ireland, but the Sullivans eventually settled on the Gasp\u00e9 coast, the thumb-like peninsula that juts off eastern Quebec. Both Michael and his brother are fifth-generation fishermen.\nHe told me about his greatest heartache, that the lobster fishery is a disaster, with catches getting smaller and smaller. He was convinced that by the time he retired, he would not be able to find someone to take over his licence.\nMacKenzie spent weeks in the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in 2019 documenting his family's preparations for the next lobster season.\n \n(Colin MacKenzie)\nBut two daughters and 11 years later, things had taken a surprising turn. Michael had been upping his catch, substantially, every year. He had gone back to the \"old ways\" \u2014 building his own wooden traps.\nMany people fish lobster with modern, prefabricated metal traps. But Michael's wooden traps are inspired by a design from his now-deceased father. They're a tribute of sorts, with Michael making adjustments each year.\nThe sea had always been a mystery to me. My father worked at a pulp and paper company and we moved from one small mill town to another, nowhere near salt water.\nThat changed after my parents' marriage ended. We moved with my mother to the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula \u2014 first to the copper-mining town of Murdochville, then to Bonaventure, where our home was beside a lighthouse on the bay.\nYears later, that is where my sister met her future husband.\nWhen I met Michael that day on the church steps, I decided I had to make a documentary about this man, his chosen path and his wooden traps. Committing to the film opened up an opportunity to spend more time with my mother, my sister, her children and Michael in their Gasp\u00e9 homes, a 10-hour drive from my apartment in Montreal.\u00a0 \nDuring the dark winter months, MacKenzie learned how much work was involved in getting ready for the springtime weeks where lobster fishers make most of their income for the year.\n \n(Colin MacKenzie)\nIn the winter of 2019, I moved into the spare room at my sister's house for five weeks to document Michael's plan to build 200 new traps.\nIt quickly became apparent that the \"old ways\" were also part of the family's daily life, with my sister looking after the household and Michael focused almost entirely on building his traps and maintaining his boat.\nEveryone worked hard, holding up their end of the family business. This fishery was the focus and everyone, kids included, contributed to that end \u2014 knitting fishing nets, tying and braiding ropes, building frames for the traps and pouring cement into their base to weigh them down.\nWhen I was growing up, my father went into an office every day. I had no idea how our home, groceries and vacations were paid for. Here at my sister's, it all was much more apparent.\nThere are 10 weeks every year when lobster can be caught, and each lobster contributes to this family's survival. There was a rhythm to those winter days, which all pointed to late April when the season opened.\nThe Baie des Chaleurs separates New Brunswick and Quebec.\n \n(Colin MacKenzie)\nDuring those dark months, the wood stove crackled in the basement and nights were filled with the girls wanting to play board games and cards, or sometimes watch a movie. Then it was back to work at the crack of dawn.\nAs spring approached, you could feel the tension rise, the home simmering with the stress of final preparations.\nIt was challenging to have all this activity swirling around me and not contribute. But my job was to attempt to capture it all on video, and to then take this world back to my edit suite.\nIt helped me understand the world this part of my family was living in. It was a doorway into another way of life, one that felt centuries away from my apartment living in the city.\nWatch \nColin MacKenzie's film The Lobster Whisperer \non CBC Gem\n.\nDo you have a compelling personal story that can bring understanding or help others?

Nova Andrews is the director of the Elevate Aviation learning centre here in Edmonton.\nShe told CBC's \nEdmonton AM\n\u00a0she was pleased to have additional funding being directed to the field.\u00a0\n\"There has been a lot more talk around diversifying our economy here in the province,\" said Andrews.\u00a0\n\"Transportation is something that is very important, and can provide a lot of jobs for Albertans if we can attract businesses to our province in this industry.\"\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw early retirements, employee layoffs, and staffing shortages; all of which contributed to a struggling air travel industry.\u00a0\nAnd as travel demand increases, a lack of qualified pilots is pushing airlines off course. Pre-pandemic, around 1,100 pilot licences were issued annually to satisfy the needs of large carriers like Air Canada and WestJet, regional planes and cargo airlines.\u00a0\nNow, according to government data in 2020 less than 500 pilot licenses were awarded. That number fell below 300 in 2021, then to 238 last year.\u00a0\n\"A lot of these jobs \u2014 such as pilots, aircraft maintenance, engineers \u2014 are highly skilled jobs and they take a long time to be able to train for,\" said Andrews.\u00a0\nA hub for the aviation industry\nIn October last year, the Alberta government and WestJet announced a memorandum of understanding (MOU), promising to make Alberta a hub for the aviation industry.\u00a0\nWestJet\u00a0said they will designate Calgary airport as the connecting hub in its network, where WestJet will connect directly to intercontinental destinations.\u00a0\nThe government committed about $73 million over the next few years toward the aviation and tourism industry in the province.\u00a0\nA part of that funding will be directed toward Mount Royal University\u00a0and other post-secondary institutions, for their aviation diplomas.\u00a0\nWith this funding, MRU will be able to add roughly 40 more seats to its aviation program in order to meet labour market demand for pilots.\u00a0\nBut Andrews said it's not enough.\u00a0\nTo qualify for commercial pilot training, students must first have their private pilot licence (PPL), the cost of which is upwards of $30,000.\u00a0\n\"It's not considered a post secondary education,\" she said. \"So, to be able to qualify for student loan funding, it's not possible unless you go through a post-secondary institution that offers an aviation diploma.\"\nAlberta premier gives mandate to develop for-profit colleges to offer diplomas and degrees\nStand-alone flying schools are not eligible for student loan funding. Neither are learning centres like Elevate Aviation, said Andrews.\u00a0\nShe said the focus should also be on skilled trades in aviation and\u00a0a concentrated effort to draw people into the industry.\u00a0\nIn an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Sawhney's office said\u00a0$11 million in its 2023 budget will support the\u00a0growth of Alberta's aviation industry,\u00a0including a new Bachelor of Aviation Management at MRU\u00a0as well as a new Air Access Bursary to support students entering aviation training.\nThe previous year's budget also included funding for aviation-related programs at the University of Calgary.\u00a0\nThe province is also exploring the concept of an aviation centre of excellence\u00a0\"to keep this momentum going; attracting talent and investment well into the future.\"",

        "content": "Over 400 students will be getting a taste of careers in the electric automotive industry in Sudbury, Ont.\nA two-week summer camp will give kids aged 10 to 14 years a chance to tour Epiroc, Technica Mining and Laurentian Chrysler\u00a0while learning about the production of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\"We choose a career eventually\u00a0based on some experience that we've had in the past,\" said Nicole Tardif, program coordinator at the Goodman School of Mines at Laurentian University.\nMore than 300 new mines needed to meet electric vehicle demand, says analyst\nFeeling left out: northern Ontario junior miners want more critical minerals funding\nAccording to a release, almost $450,000 was awarded to the Goodman School of Mines from the Ontario Vehicle Innovation Network and Ontario Centre of Innovation to set up the camp.\nThe program is part of the Electrifying the Future\u00a0project, which aims to spur job interest for northern Ontario's automotive industry and developing EVs.\nTardif added\u00a0students will be guided by camp counselors and industry professionals through a number of hands-on activities. Potato batteries, a trivia-based\u00a0exhibit called MiningOpportunity\u00a0and building miniature EVs are part of the two-week schedule.\n\"We really use our strengths since February with respect to battery electric vehicles in mining,\" she said.\nVolunteers and camp counselors sit through a presentation which will be part of the two-week schedule for students.\n \n(Submitted by Nicole Tardif)\n\"That's why we included geology as part of one of the days for this summer camp and\u00a0the students are going to be visiting dealerships while learning about the automotive mobility industry,\" Tardif added.\nThe program also includes exploring Sudbury's mining sector by going on geological treks, finding fossils and examining minerals. Students then learn how mining goes toward building batteries for a growing number of EVs, she said.\nOttawa's critical mineral strategy calls for faster project approvals\nAccording to the Ontario government, an auto pact was formed early July\u00a0to support the mass production of EVs. Stellantis-LG Energy Solutions\u00a0and Volkswagen will collectively receive up to\u00a0$28\u00a0billion in performance incentives as part of the deal.\n200 students will be going through the summer camp each week and will be on the move across a handful of industrial spots around northern Ontario, Tardif added.",

        "content": "Emergency services in northern Ontario are making more use of drone technology in critical situations, and that use is expected to increase in the coming year.\nThat's an encouraging sign for front-line officers, says Insp.\u00a0Marc Brunette with Greater Sudbury Police Services (GSPS).\nThe GSPS even expects to ramp up the number of officers trained to operate the aircraft \u2014\u00a0or Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) \u2014\u00a0with an eye on increasing the eight-person team to 12 by 2024.\n\"We've been going strong since the fall of 2020,\" Brunette said.\n\u00a0\"And the program is slowly evolving. Technology is getting more accessible, more affordable and with enhancements of technology we've found some great successes early into the program.\"\nAerial drones credited with life-saving rescues in northern Ontario\nNorth Bay company ready to deploy its mine rescue drone\nIn 2023, for example, Brunette said the GSPS has deployed drones on 34 separate occasions.\nSo far, drones have been deployed during critical emergencies,\u00a0search and rescue, lost persons, issuing warrants, tactical operations and traffic accident recreation,\u00a0 Brunette said.\n\"From an officer safety perspective, when we roll out an integrated response where we have to go into high-risk situations, oftentimes we require a lay of the land or we require an aerial shot of the buildings or the structures,\" Brunette said.\n\"Traditionally we put an officer in those positions and now we can deploy the RPAS program and have a glance from a distance.\"\nInsp. Marc Brunette, left, is the department commander for drone operators, and Const. Jacques Roberge, right, was one of the GSPS's first trained drone pilots.\n \n(Casey Stranges/CBC)\nConst.\u00a0Jacques Roberge was one of the GSPS's first trained drone pilots, and he's used them in traffic situations, saving hours of road closures while police investigate, or reconstruct,\u00a0crash scenes.\n\"You want to be able to grab as much evidence as you can at a scene, because once that scene is released \u2026 we can put the vehicles back, but it won't be the same conditions,\" Roberge said.\n\"If I took an image from Google Earth, it might have been taken in the summer or might have been taken in the winter. So [drones] give just a true perspective of what we see at the time, and it's the best evidence.\"\nIn Moosonee, Volunteer Fire Chief Scott Grant said the use of drones has been a complete \"game changer\" for the community of 3,000.\n\"As a council, we decided that if we could save one to three people a year with this drone, then it's certainly well worth the $40,000 up-front fee,\" Grant said.\u00a0\n\"To our surprise, we were all quite shocked that once we had the drone, we didn't realize how often we would actually utilize it. We've gotten to the point where we've used it almost once a month.\"\nIn May, volunteer firefighters located a woman\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0already showing signs of hypothermia \u2014\u00a0trapped on an ice chunk in the Moose River with the help of a\u00a0\nDJI 30\u00a0Matrice thermal drone\n.\nGrant said using the drones has been \"incredibly helpful\" on the wildfire front, too.\nNorth Bay drone interferes with air traffic, shutting down search and rescue exercise\nHow drones are helping Northern Ontario forestry companies manage tree inventory\n\u00a0\"When it came to a large wildland fire we had, it actually reduced our time on scene by probably six\u00a0hours,\" he said. \"Just because we were able to locate hotspots and we were able to locate where the problem spots were using the thermal camera on the drone.\n\"Not only is it helping save lives, it's actually reducing our risk, it's reducing our time that we have to spend fighting these things. So it's become an intricate part of our service.\"\nWhat about privacy laws?\nSome have \nraised concerns about the images and footage that drones collect\n, especially as it relates to privacy laws.\nIn May, Ontario's former privacy commissioner,\u00a0Ann Cavoukian, said the current commissioner should launch a provincewide investigation on how police services are using drones, and\n programs like the one by Hamilton Police Service\n\u00a0should shut down until that's done.\nBut Brunette said drone operators are governed by the Aeronautics Act and Canadian Aviation Regulations, and his pilots operate within the law.\n\"Despite being police and despite responding to emergencies, we're still required to comply with those legislative requirements,\" Brunette said. \"As such, with that comes training, and then refresher training, that the pilot has to go through every couple of years.\n\"No, we're not outside of those rules.\"",

        "summary": "Environmentalists and representatives from a nearby First Nation say they are concerned about an upcoming facility in North Bay, Ont., that will work with a chemical called PTFE, which is used in items like gaskets and seals.",
        "content": "Brennain Lloyd says she was concerned when she learned Industrial Plastics Canada (IPC) would be opening a new plant in North Bay, Ont.\n\"Our concerns are what will be coming out of that plant, what will the emissions be,\" said Lloyd, the project co-ordinator with the environmental group Northwatch, which looks at industrial projects in northeastern Ontario.\nThe company's plant, due to be fully operational next year, will transform a polymer called polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is commonly known under the trade name Teflon.\nPTFE is part of a larger group of chemicals called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). There are more than 10,000 known chemicals in the PFAS family with a wide range of everyday uses.\n\"Everybody in Canada has exposure to some types of PFAS,\" said Miriam Diamond, a professor with the University of Toronto's School of the Environment.\nUniversity of Toronto Prof. Miriam Diamond holds one of the compostable paper bowls analyzed in her lab. That type of food container was found to have high levels of PFAS, often referred to as 'forever chemicals.'\n \n(Robert Krbavac)\nDiamond, who\u00a0researches how environmental contaminants get into the environment\u00a0and how people can be exposed to them, said PFAS are largely used for their water-repelling properties. They are in waterproof jackets, bike chain grease, ski wax, and even some fast food containers and popcorn bags.\nIn Canada, a small number of these chemicals, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are banned for their effects on the environment and human health.\n\"We know that some PFAS affect the immune system by reducing immune function,\" Diamond said.\n\"We know that some PFAS affect reproduction resulting in lower fertility, lower birth weight, babies and some complications of pregnancy. Some PFAS are carcinogenic, affecting liver and kidneys.\"\nAs with other polymers \u2014\u00a0substances with very large and complex molecules \u2014\u00a0the problems with PFAS occur when the substances start to degrade and break down, Diamond said.\n\"Like a plastic bag isn't harmful itself,\" she said.\n\"But polymers can break down over time, and when the building blocks come out of the structure, it's those building blocks that are available for uptake and that can cause toxicity.\"\nDiamond said PTFE \u2014\u00a0the chemical the North Bay plant will use \u2014\u00a0is especially stable and can take decades to degrade and cause problems.\nIn addition to coating non-stick frying pans, PTFE is\u00a0used on items\u00a0like gaskets and to build medical equipment, because it stays sterile.\nMany PFAS are often referred to as \"forever chemicals\" because they can stay in the environment for hundreds\u00a0or even thousands of years.\nLike many people in North Bay, Lloyd first became concerned about the Industrial Plastics Canada plant when the Narwhal \u2014\u00a0a Canadian publication that focuses on climate change and the environment \u2014\u00a0published \na piece about the facility\n.\n\"Now the company has said they won't be manufacturing PFAS. Very good,\" Lloyd said.\n\"But they will be using PFAS. They have said there will be no releases to water. Very good. What is much less clear is what the releases will be to the air.\"\nPast contamination\nLong before Industrial Plastics Canada decided to set up shop in North Bay, the northern Ontario city had experienced environmental contamination from PFAS that affected local waterways.\nFrom the 1970s to the mid-1990s, the Department of National Defence conducted training exercises near the city's airport, using firefighting foams that contain PFAS.\nBecause of those training exercises, a longstanding drinking water advisory remains in place for Lees Creek, which is southeast of the Jack Garland Airport.\nThe Department of National Defence has granted the city nearly $20 million to address the contamination.\nCity spokesperson Gord Young said\u00a0a study to determine the next course of action is nearly done.\nYoung said North Bay's drinking water currently has 53 nanograms of PFAS\u00a0per litre, while\u00a0the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks recommends no more than 70 nanograms of PFAS per litre.\nBut Health Canada has had consultations proposing that recommendation be lowered to 30 nanograms per litre.\nCurtis Avery is the environmental manager at Nipissing First Nation, west of North Bay.\n \n(Submitted by Nipissing First Nation)\nNipissing First Nation reacts\nSome members of Nipissing First Nation \u2014 located some\u00a030 kilometres west of North Bay\u00a0along the shore of Lake Nipissing \u2014 say they too are\u00a0worried about the plant.\n\"Our forests are places that we not only participate in our traditional activities such as hunting, fishing and ceremony, but also the forest, and the lake and the fish that we feed off of. All of this is connected to the land that we are situated in,\" said Curtis Avery, Nipissing First Nation's environmental manager.\n\"And when we have these issues with forever chemicals that are not part of that system, or part of that puzzle, that are here to stay and can bioaccumulate, not only are those animals and the food web affected, but it's also us, our people.\"\nAvery noted North Bay's past issues with PFAS contamination near the airport.\n\"So there's issues that already exist involving PFAS that should have been handled before we start bringing in some other major issues involving the same group of chemicals.\"\nNorth Bay Mayor Peter Chirico says Industrial Plastic Canada's plant won't affect local waterways.\n \n(Aya Dufour/Radio-Canada)\nThe city's response\nAfter the Narwhal published its article,\u00a0the City of North Bay said Industrial Plastics Canada would be setting up in an industrial park already zoned for the type of work it planned to do.\n\"IPC doesn't manufacture raw plastics on site and its operations itself will not have any impact on local water courses,\" North Bay Mayor Peter Chirico told CBC News.\n\"Air standards will obviously be required to comply with Ontario's environmental legislation and regulations, like all manufacturers that we presently have in the city of North Bay.\"\nChirico also noted that once the plant is fully operational, it's expected to employ around 35 people.\n\"We remain dedicated to protecting our natural environment, but also, you know, supporting job creation and business growth,\" he said.\n\"And we will continue to work with this company as we do with many other companies.\"\nCraig Rice, production manager at the Industrial Plastics Canada plant, says he has lived in North Bay his entire life and it's in his own personal best interest to ensure the plant doesn't negatively affect the city.\n \n(Jonathan Migneault/CBC)\nPlant visit\nIPC invited the CBC to tour the plant, although\u00a0the company did not allow for any recordings\u00a0or photos to be taken inside the facility.\nProduction manager Craig Rice explained how they receive PTFE in a powdered form from facilities in India and Italy.\nThe North Bay plant, while still under construction, contained pallets with hundreds of boxes with the powder \u2014 resembling icing sugar \u2014\u00a0inside.\nWhen the plant is operational, workers\u00a0will pour that powder into large cylindrical steel moulds \u2014\u00a0around a metre in height \u2014\u00a0that are cold-pressed and then baked in an oven at around 350 C.\nRice explained\u00a0cold-pressing the powder turns it\u00a0into a brittle piece that is then heated to become a\u00a0more durable solid.\nThose cylinders, called billets, are either sold to customers as is\u00a0or cut into thin sheets.\nRice said manufacturers use the material to make gaskets, seals, medical equipment and other products\n \nThe Ministry of the Environment is so squeezed by budget cuts that they don't have the capacity to provide full protective oversight.\n- Miriam Diamond, University of Toronto researcher\nIn a followup email, Rice said the company will need to obtain a permit from the Ministry of the Environment before it starts to use any ovens in the facility,\n\"The exhaust that is emitted from the oven is basically just hot air which we have tested in our other facilities\" he said.\n\"But under [Ontario] regulation, a permit must be obtained for any air discharged from the facility. Our engineering staff are in the process of getting this application completed and submitted to the Ministry of the Environment.\"\nRice added that not much dust is produced when cutting the billets, but employees will wear masks as a precaution when loading the PTFE powder into the moulds.\n\"We also have a high-tech vacuum unit in order for any cleanup if spillage occurs,\" he said.\nRice said he has\u00a0lived in North Bay all his life and has property on Lake Nipissing. As an avid fisherman, he said he has a personal stake to ensure the local environment isn't polluted.\nIndustry knew about risks of PFAS 'forever chemicals' for decades before push to restrict them, study says\nPlastic found inside Arctic char has Nunavut hunters fearing for local food sources\nDiamond, of the University of Toronto, said heating PTFE powder at 350 C would release some contaminants in the air. Those could be caught with a filter, she added.\n\"The Ministry of the Environment is so squeezed by budget cuts that they don't have the capacity to provide full protective oversight.\"\nIn an email to\u00a0CBC News, the ministry said it \"takes concerns about activities that could potentially harm the environment and human health seriously.\"\n\"The Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks inspects facilities to ensure compliance with applicable environmental regulations.\u00a0Additionally, ministry staff conduct site visits to gather information and respond to community concerns,\" the email added.\nMinistry staff visited the IPC site on July 11 and determined It was not yet operational.\u00a0\n\"We made the company aware of their requirements under the\u00a0Environmental Protection Act,\" the email said.\n\"It is possible that the company will require an environmental compliance approval for air emissions before entering production.\"\nAs the plant prepares to open, activists\u00a0like Lloyd are asking for more transparency from the company to learn exactly how they plan to manage any potential emissions.",

It could also apply to other ways of using drugs, such as inhalation.\n\"It seems to be an ill-intended act to gain something from the person who has experienced the hotshot,\" said Ali.\u00a0\nIn her experience, hotshot incidents are rare, but they do happen.\nJustin had a lot of valuable items with him the night he died, and Lalonde is convinced he was given a hotshot so he could be robbed of his belongings.\nInvestigating an overdose death is complex\nWhether Justin consented to using drugs\u00a0or consented to use one drug that turned out to be laced with another\u00a0are questions the coroner and police can't answer.\u00a0\n\"Overdose deaths are very complex\u00a0and come with unique challenges from an investigative standpoint,\" said Barry Ornella, a detective staff sergeant with Greater Sudbury police.\u00a0\nHe said\u00a0detectives are called to the scene when \"there is evidence outside of what one might expect in an overdose death.\"\nBarriault's body was found this spring in the basement of his friend's house. \n \n(Aya Dufour/CBC News)\nFor instance, signs of forced entry or witness testimony can suggest a crime may have been committed.\u00a0\nOrnella said\u00a0police look to speak with anyone who was present during the overdose, but they do not have the authority to compel people to share information.\u00a0\n\"The Charter of Rights and Freedoms allows everyone the right to silence, and people exercise that right.\"\u00a0\nOrnella added\u00a0that often, anyone who was with the person who overdosed is\u00a0reluctant to co-operate with a police investigation.\u00a0\n\"They're fearful they may somehow be criminally implicated,\" he said.\u00a0\nOrnella stressed\u00a0the Good Samaritan Act offers protection in that regard, but that investigators struggle to gain trust and co-operation from those who were there.\u00a0\n\"We would like to provide answers to the families,\" he said. \"But sometimes we can't because unfortunately individuals do not come forward and help us fill in the gaps.\"\u00a0\nStigmatization and secrecy surrounding\u00a0drug use adds another challenge.\u00a0\nBarry Ornella, a detective staff sergeant with the Greater Sudbury Police Service, says detectives are called to the scene when 'there is evidence outside of what one might expect in an overdose death.' \n \n(Aya Dufour/CBC News)\n\"People who use drugs may feel shame or reluctance to share their struggle with friends or family,\" said Ornella.\u00a0\n\"There's times where people use them behind closed doors, away from their support system.\"\u00a0\nHe added\u00a0that when people who use drugs are incapacitated by substances, their belongings can go missing, which adds another layer of complexity to the investigation.\nIf police wanted to press manslaughter or murder charges for a hotshot, they would need a lot of evidence as these are very serious charges.\n\"Undoubtedly, we would need the co-operation of witnesses to help us reach the point where we can identify the individual who knowingly supplied a lethal dose of a drug to an individual,\" said Ornella.\nThere have been over 40 overdose deaths in Greater Sudbury since the beginning of the year, according to Greater Sudbury police.\n \n(Aya Dufour/CBC News)\nHe said\u00a0some late manslaughter charges have been laid in recent years, but these involved\u00a0people who contaminated the drug supply.\u00a0\nThe Greater Sudbury Police Service says it has shifted its approach when it comes to cases that involve opioids, to focus on prevention work.\n\"We're not going to arrest our way out of the opioid crisis,\" said Ornella.\u00a0\nFamilies fear police will jump to conclusions\nMichelle Barriault and Christine Lalonde fear that, as Justin's\u00a0death\u00a0was ruled accidental, the investigation will not be thorough.\u00a0\nThey said\u00a0police told them they could not provide any assistance to retrieve Justin's cellphone or computer\u00a0\u2014 devices that may contain important information.\u00a0\nThe phone service provider, in turn, said they could not help locate the device, as this is the police service's mandate.\u00a0\nBarriault had a house on Bear Island and lived with three cats.\n \n(Submitted by Michelle Barriault)\nBut they did confirm the phone was used in the weeks that followed Justin's\u00a0death.\nThat information was relayed to police, but no attempt was made to retrieve the devices, according to Lalonde.\u00a0\n\"They told us that we are not in a movie, and this case will not be resolved in 45 minutes.\"\nA grieving that lasts a lifetime\nChristene Neville also lost her son, 34-year-old Christopher Neville, to an opioid overdose, on March 23, 2022.\u00a0\nHe had a history of fentanyl use, but had stopped using in the year before he died.\u00a0\nHe was found in a friend's apartment\u00a0and had been dead for seven hours when first responders were called to the scene.\n\"He was about to start a new job, he was healthy, he was happy,\" said Christene Neville, who cannot make sense of what happened.\nA few months after his death, she received a message from a woman alleging Christopher was intentionally overdosed to be robbed of his things.\u00a0\nBefore his death in March 2022, Christopher Neville had a strong and close relationship with his daughter, and was about to start a new chapter in his life, says his family.\n \n(Submitted by Christene Neville)\nShe forwarded the woman's contact information to the detective in charge of her case, but said\u00a0the police never reached out to this woman.\n\"I called [the detective] and asked, 'Why aren't you doing something?'\" recalled Christene. \"He tells me he is trying, but deep down, I feel he's not.\"\u00a0\nThe Barriault and Neville families\u00a0feel they have been robbed and their lives have been\u00a0forever changed.\u00a0\nJust before his death, Justin\u00a0was talking about becoming a father\u00a0and enrolling in Cambrian College.\u00a0\nAs for Christopher, he had a strong and close relationship with his daughter, and was about to start a new chapter in his life.\u00a0",

Here's why\nAudio\nNew grassroots group in Sudbury to provide transitional care for homeless, at-risk population\nThe Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives released a report early Tuesday, suggesting Greater Sudbury's\u00a0hourly minimum wage needs to be $24.12 an hour to afford a two-bedroom rental.\nMichael Cullen, the director of community partnerships at Habitat for Humanity Ontario Gateway North, also suggested people in Sudbury could breathe easier with\u00a0$20 an hour\u00a0minimum wage.\u00a0\n\"The mathematics are very staggering,\" Cullen said..\n\"It's\u00a0not in favour of family affording a home or even an apartment for that context, so there are\u00a0some discrepancies that have to be sort of really pushed.\"\nMichael Cullen, director of community partnerships at Habitat for Humanity Ontario Gateway North, says it's a huge battle for people to keep up with rising rent prices when the minimum wage stays the same.\n \n(Submitted by Michael Cullen)\nAccording to Cullen, a minimum wage bump has little impact\u00a0if Sudbury's vacant affordable rental units are marked up.\u00a0\n\"There are\u00a0very few apartments in Sudbury and lots that are in very precarious situations and at-risk situations,\" he said.\nThe latest rental market report from the Canada Mortgage\u00a0and Housing Corporation (CMHC) says\u00a0low-income earners in Sudbury \"face great difficulty\" in finding rental units or moving out of the current situations.\nThe report added Greater Sudbury's overall vacancy rate stayed at a 10-year low while newcomers struggled to find affordable units to house their families.\nAdrian Dingle, a real estate developer and director of housing development at Raising the Roof,\u00a0said the information they get from the CMHC is often a a year behind, which makes it difficult for them to plan ahead.\nRaising the Roof works with developers to build affordable housing.\nSudbury living wage jumps to $19.70 per hour\nSince 2020, Sudbury's affordable rental units\u00a0have had marked-up asking prices, while minimum wage earners are forced to keep up without a pay bump, Dingle said.\n\"That's something that I'm sure is very difficult for people to adapt to,\" he added.\nMorin, with Sudbury's Centre for Transitional Care, said she's worried any increase to the minimum wage wouldn't keep up with the rising cost of living.\n\"There's such large gaps from\u00a0those who are making very less than minimum and for those making way above minimum,\" she said.\n\"There's no medium. It's go big or go homeless.\"",

        "content": "Sudbury, Ont., is consuming more power than ever, according to green energy organizations that\u00a0say meeting the\u00a0demand will require cleaner energy sources.\n\"This is the welfare of the entire city on the line and they are putting their trust in electrification,\" said David St. Georges, manager of communications at reThink Green, a non-profit organization focused on sustainability in Sudbury.\nAccording to St. Georges, Sudbury and northern Ontario can meet the\u00a0growing demand for electricity to charge electric vehicles (EVs) and smart devices.\u00a0\nCanada's looming power problem is massive but not insurmountable: report\nDecarbonizing Ontario's power grid could cost billions, some of which would be spent in the north\n'Adding 4\u00a0cities the size of Sudbury to the grid'\nAccording to the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), making a full switch from fossil fuels to other renewable energy sources could require more power plants.\n\"We have forecasted that Ontario's electricity system will need significant expansion to meet this, potentially more than doubling in size,\" the IESO told CBC News in an emailed statement.\nElectrification in the industrial sector is adding greater demand to the electrical grid.\u00a0Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. Marie and ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Hamilton both aim to get electric arc furnaces in operation. Together, those projects will require 630 megawatts.\n\"That's like adding four cities the size of Sudbury to the grid,\" IESO said.\nDevin Arthur, chapter president of the Electric Vehicle Society in Greater Sudbury, says the city has gone full circle with powering vehicles and smart devices.\n \n(Submitted by Devin Arthur)\nComing full circle\nDevin Arthur, chapter president of the Electric Vehicle society in Greater Sudbury, said the city is coming full circle with fully electrifying its power grid.\n\"We're going to need more power,\" he said.\n\"Once natural gas was introduced, that kind of switched back, and\u00a0everyone was getting out of electrification and going into natural gas and other sources of power.\"\nDespite Sudbury's increased appetite for electricity, Arthur added it's also easier to store now.\n\"What that means is you can actually use your electric vehicle as a battery storage device for the grid, so you can actually sell power from your vehicle that you've stored back to the grid, if they need\u00a0that power,\" he said.\nHarneet Panesar,\u00a0chief operating officer for the Ontario Energy Board, told CBC\u00a0the biggest challenge to going green is\u00a0seeing if it can work around older infrastructure.\n\"You want to make sure that you're building in the right spot,\" he said.\n\"Consumers are shifting from combustion engines to EV drivetrains. You're also creating more dependency. At a very high level, I'm going to say it's probably going to go up in terms of the demand for electricity.\"\nFossil fuels are the first to go for generating electricity, said St. Georges.\n\"But we're not there yet, because it's not a light switch solution. It takes time to get to that, which is another issue of electrification,\" he said.\n\"It's almost impossible for us not to go that direction.\"",

Dan Turco said most police dogs in Ontario come from breeders \u2013 through a program with the Ontario Provincial Police \u2013 but he wanted to prove a rescue dog could also do the job.\n\"I just thought, give a dog that may not have gone to a good home, just to give them an opportunity to, like a said, a rescue dog becoming a rescuer,\" Turco said.\nHe said his 11 years experience with the police service's canine unit likely meant his superiors trusted him to try something different.\nSault Ste.

Red's collar has a GPS tracker on it, so Turco always knows exactly where he is.\nIf Red finds a person, he's trained to stay with them until Turco and other officers catch up.\nPartway through his training, Red helped with a successful search for a missing child in Sault Ste.

        "content": "Toronto resident Rhonda Miller knows how difficult it can be to afford the basic necessities.\nThe 52-year-old lives in an apartment with her daughter and two granddaughters, who are nine and six.\nRising rent and food prices mean Miller has to sometimes choose between paying her bills or buying groceries.\n\"I leave the bills until I can afford it, because I have to get the food,\" she told CBC News.\nThe Millers rely on social assistance and income from some part-time work, but they say it's not enough to keep pace with the rising cost of living.\n\"It's really difficult\u00a0because sometimes the food, what I want [my grandchildren] to eat, I can't afford it, because the budget,\" said Miller, noting she worries about the impact on their health.\nRhonda Miller, 52, says the family relies on her social assistance paycheque of $900 a month. But with the rising cost of rent and groceries, Miller says they sometimes don't have enough money left over to afford adequate food. She worries about the health impact on her grandchildren.\n \n(Melanie Glanz/CBC)\nA new study \npublished Monday\n in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) highlights the clinical impact a lack of access to affordable, healthy food can have on young people's mental health.\nIt found that in food-insecure households, kids could ultimately end up relying more on the health-care system to cope with mental health and substance use disorders.\u00a0\nIn Canada, the number of people facing food insecurity \u2014 meaning they can't afford an adequate diet \u2014 has significantly grown in recent years due high inflation and the fiscal constraints brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"The more severe the food insecurity the household was experiencing, the more likely it was that children and adolescents would have a contact with health services,\" said Kelly Anderson, the study's lead author.\nKelly Anderson is the study's lead author and an associate professor at Western University in London, Ont.\n \n(Kimberley McCready/Western University )\nAnderson is an associate professor and Canada Research Chair in Public Mental Health Research at Western University in London, Ont.\u00a0\nPast research on food insecurity\n has warned of the psychological distress it can cause kids, too. But to Anderson's knowledge, this study is the first to\u00a0show\u00a0how food insecurity can likely lead to clinical disorders that strain the system.\u00a0\nLast year, \n6.9 million Canadians, including 1.8 million children\n, faced food insecurity. In Ontario, \npublic health data\n says that one in five children live in a household that struggles to put healthy food on the table.\u00a0\nUnmet basic needs can cause stress: researcher\nTo analyze the link between food and mental health, researchers looked at data between 2005 and 2014 that was connected to a community health survey on a lack of access to healthy foods.\u00a0\nThe study looked at information from more than 32,000 children, with more than 5,200 of them living in food insecure households. The children were between the ages of one\u00a0and 17 years old.\u00a0\nResults showed that kids living with food insecurity accessed medical services for mental health or substance use disorders 55 per cent more than those who had access to an appropriate diet.\nThey also recorded a greater prevalence of emergency department visits and hospital admissions\u00a0\u2014 74 per cent more\u00a0\u2014 compared to those who were food secure.\nWhy the government's grocery rebate may not do enough to help struggling Canadians\nMost commonly, the study said, health professionals were being contacted to address neurodevelopmental disorders, like autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or a mood or anxiety diagnosis.\u00a0\n\"I think it's an indicator of living in a state of chronic stress, where you're unsure whether even your most basic needs will be met,\" said Anderson.\u00a0\nThe results say that kids were less likely to have a psychotic disorder, substance use disorder or engage in deliberate self-harm.\u00a0\nDr. Gary Bloch is a family doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto whose research focuses on the ways that poverty can impact someone's health. He is also the co-founder of Inner City Health Associates, a group of doctors that work in homeless settings across the Greater Toronto Area. \n \n(CBC)\n\"It's an especially devastating read,\" Dr. Gary Bloch, a family physician at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, said of the study.\u00a0\n\"It is incredibly sad to think about children who are growing up without access to enough food, without access to enough money to live, on a day-to-day basis.\"\u00a0\nBloch's career focuses on the health impacts of poverty and the inequities that exist in accessing care.\u00a0\nWhile he says the study confirms what is already known, the focus on children creates an urgency to deal with this problem, as kids \"have little ability to control the social environments they grow up in.\"\u00a0\nData more than 10 years old\u00a0\nA key drawback of the CMAJ\u00a0study is that the data is more than a decade old.\nSince the\u00a0data was collected, even more Canadians have become food insecure, especially in recent years.\u00a0Inflation \nhit a 39-year high last summer\n.\n\"We might expect that if we were to repeat the study using more recent data, that we would find even stronger effects and more frequent use of mental health and substance use services among children,\" Anderson said.\u00a0\nThe findings also could not be generalized to First Nation communities and people living in remote parts of the province.\nDr. Anna Banerji, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist in Toronto, says the impacts of food insecurity are far-reaching.\n \n(CBC)\nDr. Anna Banerji, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist in Toronto, studies food insecurity in Indigenous youth.\u00a0She says this issue impacts them in a \"major way,\" and often leads kids to lose focus at school and eventually drop out.\n\"That leads to that cycle of poverty,\" she said.\u00a0\"These kids can have mental health issues as a consequence of food insecurity, and food insecurity is a consequence of their mental health issues.\u00a0So it's really both ways.\"\u00a0\nCalls for more income supports, food programs\nThe study's researchers say their findings emphasize the need for more initiatives to tackle food insecurity as a way to lower strains on the health-care system and prevent poor mental health outcomes that can follow a person throughout their life.\n\"Many of the risk factors that we think about in the area of mental health are very difficult to change, but [food insecurity] is one where there is something we can do about it,\" said Anderson.\nWATCH | The number of kids who don't have access to affordable, healthy food has grown:\n\u00a0\nHungry kids ending up with mental health and substance abuse issues, new study suggests\n1 day ago\nDuration \n2:06\nNew research published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that kids who don't have access to affordable, healthy food cope with mental health and substance abuse problems more than young people who have enough to eat. They also end up in hospital more often.\nThere are public policy interventions, like basic-income programs, that can ensure families have adequate resources to support themselves, she said.\nBanerji adds that schools can include nutritious breakfast or lunch programs to help kids that might arrive hungry.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, for Bloch, he says the study shows that resources should be put directly toward\u00a0dealing with poverty\u00a0\u2014\u00a0otherwise its impacts will likely end up costing more in the future.\u00a0\n\"If we don't want to pay to prevent those visits, we will pay for the visits themselves, and pay for all the ramifications of those visits, through the health system, through increased supports in the education system [and] \u2026 in social services systems,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We have real choices to make about where we want to spend our money.\"",

        "content": "Advocates for sustainable living\u00a0say access to cooling should be considered a basic need in Sudbury, Ont.\n\"It's critical for everyone,\" said Jacqueline Wilson a lawyer at the Canadian Environment Law Association.\nHeat wave in Sudbury, Ont. continues to be intolerable for some residents\n'We are at war': The latest on the heat waves around the world\nEarlier this week, Statistics Canada highlighted the importance of air conditioning across the country in a \nreport\n.\nIt reads that 85 per cent of Ontario residents owned a\u00a0household air conditioning unit.\u00a0\n\"People who did not own a home were significantly less likely to have air conditioning in Canada and in most regions,\" the report wrote.\nAccording to Jacqueline, a temperature 26 degrees Celsius or above can be dangerous for vulnerable individuals, including people battling addiction, the elderly\u00a0or homeless people.\nWhy air conditioners can be a problematic solution to extreme heat\n\"There's definitely a lack of that basic need,\" said Jehnna Morin, founder and executive director of Sudbury's Centre for Transitional Care.\nEarlier this month, Greater Sudbury and northern Ontario faced extreme heat warnings for days while temperatures rose to 29 C and above.\nMorin added she turned the Centre into a cooling station and provided a number of solutions, from popsicles to water and shade for vulnerable individuals.\n\"I can only imagine that they would not have access to to air conditioning, even further their homes or their apartments, especially those who are unhoused and living in accommodations or\u00a0walking the streets during the day,\" she said.\n\"Because we know there are no shelter access\u00a0during the day.\"\nJehnna Morin is the founder and executive director of the Sudbury Centre for Transitional Care. It's a group of workers and volunteers who help the vulnerable and at-risk populations reintegrate into society.\n \n(Ezra Belotte-Cousineau/CBC )\nBurgess Hawkins, manager of the health protection division at Public Health Sudbury & Districts told CBC News\u00a0their recommendations don't change much for those with and without access to air conditioning units.\n\"If you have air conditioning and can turn it on at home, that's great. If you don't, then we suggest you use alternative locations,\" Hawkins said.\nHe added public places open during the day, including shopping malls and libraries are ideal spots to cool off.\nBut for those at home without air conditioning units, water and eliminating light sources help lower the temperature, he added.\n\"Taking a cool shower or bath will help\u00a0within the house itself. Electric lights, especially if you still have incandescent bulbs, throw off a lot of heat.\"\nStatistics Canada said its latest report is the first to measure air conditioning use.\nWilson, a lawyer focused on sustainable solutions, said it takes lowering two degrees to prevent heat-related illnesses\u00a0outdoors.\n\"When we talk about increasing urban tree cover, for instance, low income neighbourhoods tend to have much less tree cover and are hotter as compared to other neighbourhoods. When we talk about green roofs and cooling centers, those are all part of an appropriate response,\" she added.\nBut these infrastructure tweaks are still far from a solutions in the face of climate change, she said.\n\"There needs to be a real focus on protecting the health of people who are in that situation and that's where the active cooling comes in.\"",

        "content": "Metro Morning's\n\u00a0food guide Suresh Doss joins the program every week to discuss one of the many great GTA eateries he's discovered.\nThis week, he's bringing us to Aragoz Restaurant\u00a0in Scarborough Village.\nBelow is a lightly edited transcript of Doss's conversation with guest host Farrah Merali.\nFarrah Merali: \nCan you remind people of what to expect from Scarborough Village?\nSuresh Doss:\n\u00a0So this is a small neighbourhood in the southeast part of Scarborough, just as you are leaving the city on Kingston Road and heading toward Pickering. It's a very vibrant part of Scarborough \u2014 especially Markham Road, which is filled with so many amazing places to eat. It's also\u00a0probably the densest place in the city for halal foodstuffs because there's a thriving Muslim community there. There are lots of new restaurants, like the one we are going to today: Aragoz.\u00a0\nMerali: \nSo this is a new Egyptian restaurant?\nDoss:\u00a0\nIt opened during the pandemic,\u00a0about two years ago. The kitchen is led by the sole cook and owner Adam Soliman. It's no exaggeration to say Adam has been cooking since he was nine years old. He says he always knew that's what he wanted to do.\u00a0He moved to Canada in the '90s and began his career by working as a bus boy during his teen years. He says this is\u00a0because he was too short to do anything else in the professional kitchens.\nFrom there, he worked\u00a0his ways up\u00a0and he has worked at a number of high profile restaurants in the city \u2014 name a place and there's likely a connection. He's a part of this bridge of Egyptian cooks that have started to open restaurants in the GTA\u00a0over the last five years.\nOwner and sole cook at Aragoz Restaurant,\u00a0Adam Soliman, says he's always wanted to be a chef. \n \n(Suresh Doss/CBC)\nMerali: \nTell us about the Egyptian rice pilaf.\u00a0\nDoss:\n It's this wonderful dish of rice served with toasted vermicelli noodles and cooked in a good amount of ghee. Adam uses ghee in a lot of his dishes, and it's actually a mixture of two different ghees, which really manages to enhance the nutty forward note.\u00a0I would recommend you get the rice with a traditional Egyptian dish called molokay.\nMerali: \nWhat's that dish?\nDoss:\u00a0\nThis is a type of leaf that is crushed with a double-handed knife until the leaf\u00a0 starts to develop this viscosity. It's then cooked with stock\u00a0to the right consistency and when it's served, it's topped with tasha\u00a0or taklia.\u00a0This is the process of tempering the molokay with a hot mixture of fried coriander and garlic in hot ghee and then crowning the bowl.\u00a0To eat this dish, you want to spoon some of the soup onto the rice and enjoy it that way.\u00a0\nAragoz Restaurant in Scarborough Village serves up traditional Egyptian cuisine including grapevine leaves alongside grilled kebab sandwiches and a special roasted yogurt duck. \n \n(Suresh Doss/CBC)\nMerali: Sounds delicious. What else should we be trying?\u00a0\nDoss: \nThere are a number of sandwiches you can get that feature grilled kebabs and marinated meats served on a soft bun.\u00a0I really encourage you to try the fried liver sandwich \u2014 it's my favourite there. This is a\u00a0fantastic spiced lamb mixture that is cooked to get a nice char. There are also many vegetarian and vegan dishes on the menu.\u00a0Two, I will say, I love are grapevine leaves that are stuffed with a mixture of rice, tomatoes and punchy herbs. There's also the ditilini tagine\u00a0pasta served with a tomato and hot pepper sauce.\u00a0\nBut the main attraction, if you are going with a group, is the roast duck. And be warned, you must order in advance.\u00a0This is such a rare and unique way of presenting duck. I've never seen it anywhere else.\u00a0You have to book it at least\u00a072 hours ahead. Call and tell Adam you want the yogurt duck, which features a yogurt mixture, which is rubbed all over whole duck and left to sit overnight.\u00a0It is then slowly cooked for nearly two hours.\u00a0",

Make no mistake\u00a0\u2014\u00a0this is the climate crisis in action.\"\nHowever, those battling the fires \u2014 including firefighters, pilots, logistics staff, engineers\u00a0or other workers\u00a0\u2014 \"are not being respected by this government with fair wages and fair working conditions,\" Stiles said.\n\"When fire workers aren't supported, it's hard to recruit,\" she said. \"That has serious consequences for future summers when we need people with the experience and the knowledge to lead our fire crews and keep us safe.\"\nFewer crews from U.S., other provinces\nTaylor Dalzell is\u00a0a wildland firefighter from Pickle Lake and crew leader in Ontario who's\u00a0in his eighth season fighting wildfires.\nHe told CBC Radio's\u00a0\nThe Current\n\u00a0that this year's forest fires are \"getting larger and some of them are quite intense.\"\n\"I know specifically for Ontario we are short crews this fire season,\" he said. \"We're not up to our full complement of crews, so it can be quite difficult fighting some of those fires.\"\nFamily mourns Alberta pilot who died fighting wildfire\nCBC Explains\nMillions of Canadians will face extreme fire danger this summer. Here's what that means and how to stay safe\nOverall, Dalzell said Ontario is short about 48 fire crews this year.\n\"For the teams on the ground within Ontario, that means we don't have as much resources to draw from when we're fighting certain fires. I know that could be taxing on the crews, because we are going to be spread that much more thin.\"\nIn previous seasons, Ontario could bring in crews from other provinces or the United States for extra support, but because the 2023 fire season is so chaotic, that isn't possible.\n\"Luckily we were able to get some crews in from Mexico,\" he said. \"However, there was only a limited number of crews because I think a majority of the Mexican crews went to B.C. and Alberta.\"\u00a0\nOntario NDP Leader Marit Stiles spoke at a news conference in Toronto on Monday, saying the wildfire situation shows 'this is the climate crisis in action.'\n \n(Andrew Lahodynskyj/The Canadian Press)\nAt Monday's news conference, fire management technician Mark Belanger said crew leaders make about $17,000 over a six-month fire season.\n\"None receive any isolation, or danger pay or standby pay for when they're out on fire assignments and in the bush,\" he said.\n\"It takes a minimum of seven years to become a proficient crew leader and a supervisor. The required knowledge can't be taught. It's specifically experienced based. When we draw students from two- and four-year programs to come fight fires, but then don't provide job opportunities or hope for the future, it's easy to see how we failed to retain them or get those seven years of experience.\n\"We need experienced people to lead crews, but if people aren't willing to stay in the job, we lose all of those years of experience and we can't form enough crews.\"\nMilitary crews, or those from outside Canada, meanwhile, can only be used for\u00a0specific, low-risk assignments, Belanger said.\nFord refuses calls to link wildfires to climate change\nStiles said that in addition to higher wages, provincial funding cuts to forest fire operations must be reversed.\n\"The Ford Conservatives\u00a0and the governments before them\u00a0have turned a highly skilled, experienced workforce into a precarious workforce where we cannot retain and recruit people.\"\u00a0\nEmergency preparedness funding is up:\u00a0MNR spokesperson\nIn a written response to CBC News, the province said there have been no cuts to firefighting services; in fact, emergency fire preparedness funding has been increased by more than 92 per cent since 2018.\n\"In 2021-22, the province's year-start allocation for Emergency Fire Fighting was $100 million, and year-end expenditures were $249 million,\" a spokesperson for the Ministry of Natural Resources stated. \"In 2022-23, the year-start allocation was $100 million;\u00a0the year-start allocation has increased in 2023-24 to $134.9 million.\n\"As shown, we do not hesitate to spend more than what is allocated in the budget process to ensure that staff have the equipment and resources they need to fight wildland fires safely. As this year's fire season unfolds, we will continue to dedicate the necessary resources to ensure the safety and protection of our communities.\"\nThe ministry said staffing levels have been impacted by a highly competitive labour market\u00a0and other economic factors, but the province is exploring recruitment and retention strategies to address the shortage.\nWages for forest fire fighters are negotiated through a collective bargaining process. Currently, fire rangers in Ontario make between $22.89 and $29.26 per hour, and the existing collective bargaining agreement will be in place until Dec.\u00a031.",

Both former mayor John Tory and deputy mayor Jennifer McKelvie waged public campaigns\u00a0to get funding from both levels of government to cover the shortfall which is largely related to continued costs from the pandemic.\nIn recent years, both the federal and provincial governments had provided billions in funding to help the city cover those costs. But 2022 marked the first time the federal government did not provide that funding even as the province gave Toronto several hundred millions to help address the gap.\u00a0\nTory asks council to back study of new taxes and fees, calls for new 'fiscal framework'\nToronto council backs study of new taxes and fees to address fiscal woes\nIn the end, Toronto postponed millions in infrastructure work, pulling money from its capital budget to balance its books, something that is required by law.\nFreeland says that those funds could cover off the $933 million shortfall expected by the city this year.\u00a0\n\"As of September 30, 2022, Toronto's total reserves and reserve funds held a balance of $11.2 billion\u2014up $2.2 billion, or 25 per cent, from 2021,\" Freeland writes. \"We estimate that within these reserves, at least $1.6 billion is available in uncommitted \"stabilization\" funds.\"\u00a0\nSince taking office, Chow has spoken with both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and\u00a0Ford. The province has signalled a willingness to partner with the city, she said.\u00a0\n\"I remain hopeful that the federal government will join us as well, despite today's finger-pointing,\" Chow said.\u00a0\n\"Recently, when we worked together sheltering refugees, we saw some immediate short-term successes. That is the kind of continued partnership we need to deliver affordable housing, fast and reliable transit, and good public services for the people of Toronto for years to come,\" she added.\nA spokesperson for Premier Doug Ford said the Ontario government has provided billions in funding to help the city address its COVID-19 shortfall.\u00a0\n\"We hope the federal government and Toronto can work together to find a solution,\" Caitlin Clark said in a statement.\nFederal budget offers no bailout for Toronto's pandemic-induced shortfall\nToronto asks residents to push federal government to fill $235M funding gap",

        "content": "Metro Morning's\n\u00a0food guide Suresh Doss joins the program every week to discuss one of the many great GTA eateries he's discovered.\nThis week, he brings us to\u00a0The Pho Restaurant in Markham.\nBelow is a lightly edited transcript of Doss's conversation with guest host Farrah Merali.\nFarrah Merali: \nSoup in the summertime?\nSuresh Doss:\n I know we are in peak summer mode right now, but I want to take our listeners out for some noodle soup.\nMerali:\n\u00a0I have to admit when I think of summer weather, my mind doesn't immediately go to hot noodle soup. But I'm prepared to be convinced! Where are we headed?\u00a0\nDoss: \nSo I'm taking you to Markham, arguably one of the biggest and best food strips in the GTA \u2014 along Highway 7, filled with dozens of plazas and\u00a0food courts.\u00a0We're heading to a plaza that isn't known for food, it's tucked away slightly east of Woodbine Road, on the north side of Highway 7. The Pho Restaurant is a few years old and it's become somewhat of a regular spot for me.\nMerali:\u00a0\nWhat makes it so special?\u00a0\nDoss:\n We have no shortage of Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA and certainly no shortage of Pho restaurants. I can also confidently say that we've become such a food-obsessed city that most people that like to eat out probably have their favourite pho place.\nBut I think what makes\u00a0The Pho Restaurant\u00a0so special is the\u00a0combination of things that they're doing.\u00a0The menu has a\u00a0constellation of popular Vietnamese dishes and really puts care into the ingredients used. Every dish has its own vibrancy.\u00a0The broth, in particular,\u00a0here is just wonderful and has an incredible amount of depth.\u00a0\nA bowl of pho tai nam with tendon. \n \n(Suresh Doss/CBC)\nMerali:\n\u00a0Is there a specific noodle soup you recommend?\nDoss: \nNow, the litmus test for a pho restaurant is the pho\u00a0tai nam \u2014 it's the basic pho. You can get it with rare beef, or beef tendon or tripe. But that soup will really allow you to discover the depth of flavour used here. So if you're going there for the first time and you need convincing then just get the basic pho and you'll be really happy.\nMerali: \nWhat if you're in the mood for something else?\nDoss: \nSo if you don't like beef or pork, this is one of the rare places that makes its own chicken pho. Most times\u00a0when you go to a Vietnamese restaurant and there's a chicken pho, they'll use a beef stock.\u00a0But\u00a0here they make a separate chicken stock, which is really wonderful because they have a really sublime chicken stock with the essence of chicken accented by bamboo shoots, which are punched up by an assortment of Vietnamese herbs.\nIf you want something heartier, I would get the b\u00f2\u00a0kho. This is almost a curry-like beef stew that has a slight sweetness from these whole chunks of carrots that are cooked in the soup. The highlight in this soup is really the ginger, star anise and cinnamon. Any of these soups are great options, and I would highly recommend you ask for the homemade noodle.\nMerali:\u00a0\n What's so special about that?\nDoss: \nUnlike most pho restaurants, they make their own noodles. And this is another reason why I think this place really stands out. There's a satisfying chew to these house-made noodles. You have to ask for it though and on the menu you might see two options, but I would specify it just in case.\nA basket of Nem N\u01b0\u1edbnm Vietnamese grilled pork sausage. \n \n(Suresh Doss/CBC)\nMerali: \nWhat else would you order here if you were with a group?\nDoss: \nGet the Hainanese chicken rice. Now this is not typically a Vietnamese dish but it uses the whole chicken, which is\u00a0poached gently, so don't be afraid if its slightly pink. It's totally fine.\u00a0It's then sliced and served alongside rice that has been cooked in the chicken stock, so its wonderfully aromatic and has that chicken essence to it. It's\u00a0also served with a bowl of the chicken broth, which again is really wonderful.\nThere's also the bo la lop, which is wonderfully aromatic beef that has been cooked with lemon grass and is then wrapped in betel leaves. And it comes with a great dipping sauce.\nAnd recently, I tried the banh\u00a0dap with a group of friends and they really enjoyed it.\u00a0Picture these disc shaped vermicelli noodles that are slightly fried so they are crispy but still have a nice chew to them. They're\u00a0topped with grilled pork. I suggest you squeeze some lime on top\u00a0 and maybe add a dash of the house chili oil. I have to say, it was an instant hit at the table.\u00a0\nAt this Mississauga restaurant, a small but mighty menu celebrates the cuisine of the Uyghur people\nBey Route Kaake Caf\u00e9 in Oakville is bringing Lebanese handbag bread to the GTA",

        "content": "Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne's newly launched consultation process regarding wireless access on Toronto's subway system proposes a timeline that could see the dispute between carriers resolved by December and partial service rolled out for all customers by the middle of 2024.\nNoting a lack of progress in negotiations, Champagne announced Monday an expedited consultation process to revise the licences of all four of Canada's major wireless carriers \"to ensure that all TTC riders have coverage, including 911 service, in all tunnels and stations, followed by voice, data and text as soon as technically feasible.\"\nThe move by Champagne comes amid a stalemate in talks since Rogers Communications Inc. bought the Canadian operations of BAI Communications, which had owned the rights to provide wireless service on the subway, in April.\n\"On a broader scale, it's absolutely ridiculous that a world-class city like Toronto doesn't have this service in their subways because most major cities have this service,\" said David Soberman, a marketing professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management who follows the telecom sector.\n\"The fact that the federal government has to get involved is a bit discouraging.\"\nParties have until Aug. 8 to submit comments on the proposed licence conditions, plus another 15 days to respond to other submissions. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada would then post a decision following a review of the feedback it receives, triggering a 30-day window for the carriers to complete negotiations.\nArbitration possible if deadline not met\nIf Rogers and its rival carriers fail to meet that deadline, they would be required to enter an arbitration proceeding, which must be completed within 70 days.\nAfter either negotiations or arbitration have concluded, each major carrier would be required to offer voice, text and data services in all TTC stations within the following six months and 80 per cent of subway tunnels within two years.\nEach company would also have to offer cellular cervices in all TTC tunnel areas within three years.\nRogers promised to create a system accessible for other mobile carriers by working with its rivals to provide wireless coverage. \n \n(CBC)\nRogers has announced plans to upgrade the existing network built by BAI, which includes service at most downtown subway stations, and build 5G capability for the entire network of stations and tunnels \u2014 a process it expects to take two years.\n\"We've been hard at work with the TTC to upgrade the existing network and make 5G available to all riders as soon as possible,\" said Rogers spokesman Cam Gordon in a statement.\nRogers has vowed to work with its rivals and make the upgraded system accessible for other mobile carriers to provide wireless coverage. That includes honouring BAI's previous contract with Freedom Mobile, now owned by Quebecor Inc.\nIt also proposed a framework in May that pledged to consult other carriers on design and planning, accommodation of spectrum needs and access to carrier base station hotels as it adds 5G capacity to the TTC.\nThat proposal included an Aug. 15 deadline to reach an agreement, or have an arbitrator rule on the matter by this fall.\nCompanies call for consortium model\nBut Bell Canada and Telus Corp. have both fiercely advocated for a joint build of the subway's 5G network using a consortium model similar to that of Montreal's Metro system rather than a pay-for-access approach. Rogers has not publicly committed to either model.\nSoberman said he believes a consortium model is the most likely end result of Ottawa's proposed negotiation process. Other potential outcomes could see an independent organization, or a government entity, oversee and provide cellular service.\nBell Canada and Telus Corp. are embracing the idea of using a consortium model similar to that of Montreal's Metro system rather than a pay-for-access approach. \n \n(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\nHe compared mobile phone access to an essential service like electricity, water or roads, for which most Canadians would expect the government to step in if a company providing those services wasn't meeting expectations.\n\"A model in which one company owns the infrastructure and charges the others is probably not the way we're going to go,\" he said.\nSoberman said the companies have an incentive to work out their disagreements in negotiations rather than wait for arbitration, a method which he said carries a high risk for either side.\n\"Obviously, Bell and Telus are not going to want to be in a situation where only Rogers customers get service in the TTC,\" he said.\nIt's unclear whether Rogers would seek to offer 5G service on the subway to its own customers before those with other carriers if the infrastructure is ready before the dispute is resolved.\nTTC report mum on rival access as Rogers eyes 5G upgrades to downtown subway by fall\nA TTC report this month said the transit agency expects Rogers will be able to provide 5G capability along tunnels and stations from Union Station north to St. George and Bloor-Yonge stations by the start of the school year.\nBut the report remained mum on whether customers of other companies will have service this fall.\nNeither Rogers nor the TTC provided an answer to that question when asked Tuesday.\n\"Rogers has committed to engaging with all carriers and getting them onboard soon as possible,\" said TTC spokesman Stuart Green. \"We look forward to the successful conclusion of that work.\"\nDelays are unfair, TTC advocacy group says\nThe consultation notice released by Champagne noted the federal department is considering imposing conditions that would prevent Rogers from providing service on the TTC until all parties have reached an agreement. Ottawa said the ability to do so \"could confer a competitive advantage.\"\nSoberman said such a restriction would be a \"lose-lose\" scenario as it would further delay access to cellular service for all customers even once the infrastructure is built.\nA TTC advocacy group says any delay of providing wireless service in subway is unfair to customers.\n \n(David Donnelly/CBC)\nShelagh Pizey-Allen, executive director of the TTCriders advocacy group, said all customers need access as soon as possible and that \"any delay is unfair.\"\n\"Everyone needs access to cell service on the TTC, not just 911 service, but access to texting because it's about safety and also about navigating the system, getting real time updates if there's a security incident or just a delay,\" she said.\n\"What we're looking for is news that all TTC users will be able to use their cellphones in the subway tunnels, no matter who their provider is.\"\nPizey-Allen said the TTC deserves a share of the blame for allowing the situation to drag on for a decade before green-lighting Rogers' purchase of the network without public debate.\n\"It really shouldn't have taken this long and taken a crisis in public confidence and safety to get action on this,\" she said.\nBell seeks regulator intervention amid spat with Rogers over access to TTC network",

        "content": "After Meredith Wilkinson lost her right leg six years ago \u2014 a garbage truck hit her and dragged her under\u00a0its front tire \u2014 she had to go through driver retraining to get her licence back.\nBut the driver who turned into her in a Toronto bike lane wasn't required to do any training at all.\n\"I had to undergo [retraining] and that made sense to me, there was something that had changed physically to me and there's checks and balances,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"But it's just shocking that the driver who did that to me, they would not have to do that sort of driver retraining as of right now.\"\nWilkinson, a transportation engineer in Toronto, wants\u00a0that to change. She wants to see a provincial NDP bill that would amend the Highway Traffic Act (HTA), become law.\u00a0\nIf enacted, the Moving Ontarians Safely Act would subject any driver convicted of an HTA offence\u00a0who seriously injures or kills a pedestrian, cyclist or\u00a0others outside of a motor vehicle to a probation order which would suspend their licence.\u00a0 \nThe probation order would require the convicted driver to take a driving instruction course and perform driving safety-related community service before getting their licence back. The bill has passed first reading the Ontario Legislature.\n\"If a driver did that to someone, you'd want them to become a better driver, right? And how do we make them a better driver? It might not be putting them in jail or charging them a lot of money,\" said Wilkinson.\u00a0\n\"Maybe more of these charges will stick because it's more reformative.\"\nIn Wilkinson's case, she says the driver was charged with careless driving at the scene, but paperwork wasn't filed correctly so the charge couldn't proceed in court. The amendments wouldn't affect someone in her exact situation.\u00a0\nBut thousands of other careless driving charges in Ontario have\u00a0recently been dropped and, in some cases,\u00a0pleaded down. The amendments would affect at least some of those cases.\nCBC Toronto reviewed Ontario Court of Justice statistics which show the number of careless driving charges laid both across the province and in Toronto specifically have gone down in recent years and that the percentage of those charges withdrawn before trial has skyrocketed.\u00a0\nSuch charges laid\u00a0in Ontario have dropped by 27 per cent,\u00a0or by almost 10,000\u00a0between 2015 and 2022.\nIn that same period, the number of those charges withdrawn before trial across the province increased by 374 per cent, with 5,139 more charges withdrawn before trial in 2022 compared to 2015.\nSimilarly, in Toronto, the number of charges laid dropped 39 per cent and the number of charges withdrawn before trial rose by 52 per cent in that same period.\u00a0\nMore charges are being dropped or pleaded\u00a0down to a lesser charge by under-resourced prosecutors who are facing enormous backlogs coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, say legal stakeholders representing both drivers and those injured.\n\"It's a system that has been overburdened,\" said Toronto lawyer Patrick Brown. \"Especially with COVID, you need to put more prosecutors in and give them more funding in order that they can properly prepare a case.\"\nBrown has more than 25 years experience with HTA\u00a0offences through his work representing personal injury clients from automobile crashes. He says the stats are not surprising.\u00a0\nParalegals CBC Toronto spoke to say they've seen occasional purges of Highway Traffic Act (HTA) charges.\n \n(CBC)\n\"The system is broken,\" said Brown. \"The entire system seems to be handcuffed against having any real conclusion to these charges that could send any meaningful deterrent\u00a0so people stop doing this type of behaviour.\"\nBrown says\u00a0previous attempts to crack down on careless driving \nby increasing fines and jail sentences\n have backfired and resulted in drivers fighting the charge more aggressively. He says that means \"more and more will plead down to a lower thing because the system is overloaded.\"\nCities, province both prosecute HTA charges\nIn most Ontario municipalities, HTA charges are prosecuted by a combination of city prosecutors and provincial Crown attorneys. In Toronto, the province largely handles more serious charges \u2014 when the accused is issued a summons to appear in court and not just a ticket, according to the city.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General, for which Crowns work, said the ministry can't comment on the outcomes of cases.\u00a0\n\"In general, we can advise that the Crown will consider the individual facts, circumstances and available evidence in a case when taking a position on resolution and when recommending an appropriate sentence to the Court,\" said Maher Abdurahman in a statement.\u00a0\n\"Our focus is to ensure that our existing protections work effectively to change the behaviour of offenders and reduce the risk for all road users.\"\nA spokesperson for the City of Toronto said it does not comment on judicial outcomes, but acknowledged the pandemic's\u00a0temporary closure of courts caused some backlog and delays across the province.\u00a0\nThose delays sometimes see prosecutors drop charges if they decide the case can't be brought to court \"within a reasonable amount of time\u2026 in light of a defendant's Charter rights,\" said spokesperson Eric Holmes in a statement.\nPatrick Brown, a Toronto lawyer, wants to see amendments to the HTA would see some convicted under it have their licence suspended until they complete a driving instruction course.\n \n(Jason Trout/CBC)\nThe drop in careless driving charges can partly be attributed to officers laying more precise charges, but also goes back to staffing and other resource\u00a0shortages for police and courts, according to the\u00a0president of the Toronto Police Association.\n\"No matter the charge, it's frustrating for [officers] when an equally under-resourced court decides not to proceed with cases,\" said Jon Reid in a statement.\u00a0\n\"This is the reality of our current justice system. Without proper investments in policing and the courts, the reductions we're seeing in enforcement and prosecutions will continue.\"\nHTA charges getting purged\nParalegal Jami Sanftleben, who largely defends clients on HTA charges, says right now it's worth it for his clients to wait and see what happens in court.\n\"You have a better chance than in the past of getting a favourable resolution \u2014 I think because of that backlog and because of the lack of resources,\" he said. \"There is a chance they could get a very good offer to resolve.\"\u00a0\nSanftleben says several major municipalities like Toronto are facing massive backlogs of HTA cases and \"every once in a while\" prosecutors will do a purge of charges, in what he thinks is an effort to catch up. \n\u00a0\nWhen it comes to changing the outcomes of these charges, Brown sees solutions in the amendments proposed to the HTA.\u00a0 \nOPP says 150 people have died in car crashes on provincial highways so far this year\nShould Canada follow U.S. lead and make anti-impaired technology mandatory in all new cars?\nToronto woman, 42, charged after crash that killed 81-year-old cyclist in Burlington\n\"That law would prevent all these people from pleading down on careless driving because they're not going to avoid that minimum sentence,\" he said, referring to the proposed suspended licence until community service and a driving course are completed.\u00a0\nCBC Toronto asked Attorney General Doug Downey's office whether the government supports the bill. A spokesperson said it will go \"through the normal course, with opportunity for debate and a vote by members of the House.\"\u00a0\nFor her part, Wilkinson hopes the proposed changes could mean others injured by drivers get the closure and peace of mind she says she was denied in her case.\n\"It's just about making better drivers, making it safer out there for vulnerable road users,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"That feels like a good start.\"",

        "content": "An average of 273 people a night were told there was no bed available for them in Toronto homeless shelters in June\u00a0\u2014 a new record high for the city, newly released data shows.\nHomeless advocates tell CBC Toronto they believe the number is very concerning\u00a0and believe the number may be an\u00a0undercount. Many are calling for more shelter beds, permanent and affordable housing, an increase in Ontario Works rates and rent control for\u00a0all new tenants.\u00a0\nThe data is from the city's central intake, a telephone service that offers referrals to emergency shelter, other overnight accommodation and information about homelessness services. It can be found on the city's Shelter System Requests for Referral page, which lists monthly average data from the city since June 2021 on the number of callers who are \"unmatched to shelter\" at the end of the day.\nThis past June, the \"average daily number of unmatched individual callers\" was 273.5, a new high up from 219.9 in May, when the average first\u00a0exceeded 200. The spike in numbers followed the city's announcement on May 31 that it would refer asylum seekers to\u00a0federal programs and services, saying its shelter system was at capacity and calling for more funding from Ottawa.\n\"Close to 300 individual callers seeking a bed are left unmatched for shelter space each night \u2013 45 per cent of whom are refugees,\" the city said in an email on Sunday.\u00a0\n'It's shameful,' says activist\nA. J. Withers, an activist who has studied the Toronto shelter system extensively, said the\u00a0number is likely higher than reported because the city doesn't include families in its count of \"unmatched individual callers.\"\n\"This crisis in the shelter system is worsening, which is is deeply concerning,\" they said.\nA.J. Withers, the Ruth Wynn Woodward Junior Chair of the Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies Department at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, says: 'We've been saying for a very long time that there's a crisis in the shelter system and this means that this crisis in the shelter system is worsening, which is deeply concerning.'\n \n(Submitted by A.J. Withers)\n\"There are hundreds of people every night who cannot get into the shelter system, and we know that many people give up. That number also represents a lot more people who stopped calling. It means that many people are sleeping outside.\n\"The city has basically abandoned its most vulnerable people. And it's shameful.\"\nEarlier this month, the city said in an email that it has \"more shelter beds per capita than any other large Canadian city.\" But despite adding more than 1,000 new shelter spaces in the last year, the system remains \"at capacity most nights.\"\nWithers said the city needs to open about 2,000 shelter beds immediately to try to meet the need. \nA combination of rising rents, a lack of rent control for new tenants, rising food prices and inflation are all making life unaffordable in the city, Withers said. All three levels of government are to blame and could make different choices to improve the lot of unhoused people, they added.\nCity may need to expand family shelter system: Tanner\nJune's record-high number comes as the city is working to find lodgings for ayslum seekers. Last week, \nBlack-led organizations stepped in\n and found shelter for the asylum seekers mainly in two churches in North York. The asylum seekers were sleeping on city sidewalks downtown outside a homeless support centre as different levels of government fought\u00a0over funding for shelters.\u00a0\nIn a statement on\u00a0Friday, the city said it has taken \"swift action\" to secure emergency accommodations for the asylum seekers.\u00a0The city said it has secured hotel rooms and it is moving the asylum seekers\u00a0in, with the aim of\u00a0increasing\u00a0lodging capacity for a total of 250 individuals, as per direction\u00a0from city council.\nHow Black-led groups quickly moved more than 200 asylum seekers off a Toronto street to shelter\nBlack-led coalition that opened doors to asylum seekers calls for more government help, donations\nThe city's central intake has a separate process for unhoused families with children, called the family placement process. Through this process, families can access additional resources through Ontario Works and Toronto Employment and Social Services to access space in hotels until a shelter space becomes available. The city said it operates 14 family shelter programs and provides shelter and support to more than 2,450 people.\u00a0\nBut it may need to expand the family shelter system, said Gord Tanner, general manager of the city's Shelter Support and Housing Administration.\n10,418 'actively homeless' in Toronto in last 3 months\nIn a July 5 interview with CBC Toronto, Tanner said the city's shelter system is under unprecedented strain. He said the city has about 9,000 shelter beds and is supporting about 170 families outside of the shelter system in hotels while they wait to get into the system.\nTanner said the city has long used hotels hotels to support families, whether asylum seeking or not,\u00a0but may need to invest further in family shelters to meet the demand.\n\"It's something that we're taking a close look at... Children [are] involved in many of these situations and we need to take extra care and make sure we're doing our best to support families in the best way we can.\"\nA view of a room at the Weston King Neighbourhood Centre, a non-profit community centre that serves Weston and Mount Dennis neighbourhoods. Its advocacy workers call the city in search for shelter beds for clients.\n \n(Submitted by Mei Wang)\nAccording to the city's Shelter System Flow Data page, there are 10,418 people considered \"actively homeless\" in the last three months in Toronto.\nLast week, the federal government announced it would provide $212 million for the Interim Housing Assistance Program, which provides funding on a cost-sharing basis to provinces and municipalities to cover\u00a0the costs of interim housing for asylum claimants. Of that amount,\u00a0$97 million would be earmarked for Toronto.\u00a0 \nCould mean 'life or death': advocate\nMei Wang, an advocacy worker at the Weston King Neighbourhood Centre, a non-profit community centre that serves Weston and Mount Dennis neighbourhoods, said on Monday that the number is not surprising.\u00a0\n\"It's been hard calling central intake for people,\" she said. \"Since September... it hasn't been an ideal situation.

        "content": "In scenes reminiscent of the Old West, cattle rustlers are making off with entire herds of live animals and in many cases, getting away with it.\nJohn Meston lost 85 cattle last fall, including two 900-kilogram bulls, four cows and 79 calves. All told, that's $175,000 worth of cattle, he said.\n\"A hit like this is quite devastating,\" Meston said from his farm near Westlock, Alta.\n\"To work all our career in this industry, which we love, and to have this happen, it leaves a very bad taste in your mouth.\"\nWatch\nFrom brazen beehive heists to contemporary cattle rustling, strange but true stories from across Canada\n2 alleged cattle rustlers charged after search of Sask. farm: RCMP\nIt's the second time Meston has dealt with rustlers, or cattle thieves. Nine years ago he had 21 cattle taken. In 2018\u00a0a neighbour had 100\u00a0calves stolen. Neither case was ever solved, according to the RCMP.\n\"In the middle of the night, they're gone,\" said brand inspector Butch Harris, who's been working to protect farmers, ranches and auction houses from theft and fraud for 41 years.\u00a0\nBrand Inspector Butch Harris, pictured Thursday, urges cattle owners to ensure their stock is branded to help recover animals which are stolen.\n \n(Sam Martin, CBC News)\nInspectors like Harris check to ensure the brand mark on cattle matches the farm or ranch that owns them. He says about 45 per cent of Alberta cattle are branded.\nRustling has been around a long time, he said.\n\"So as long as there's cattle it'll damn sure happen and probably always will to a certain degree,\" Harris said.\n\"There's way too much of it. It goes on, no doubt about it.\"\nRising beef prices play a role\nHarris has seen the number of cattle thefts in Alberta creeping up in recent years, particularly among the smaller thefts where people are taking \"one or two head\" to put in the deep freeze.\nThere are also abattoirs and butchers that sell stolen beef on the black market. As beef prices rise it becomes more lucrative, Harris said.\n\"With the way the economy is going and with the conditions of\u00a0COVID and all of that I think a few have shown up that way for sure. Our missing reports seem to increase every year,\" Harris\u00a0said.\nWATCH | An agricultural disaster in\u00a0Alberta:\u00a0\n'Agricultural disaster' declared in parts of Alberta thanks to years of drought\n21 days ago\nDuration \n2:30\nFarmers and ranchers in parts of Alberta are struggling after four years of drought, with no end in sight. Some are being forced to abandon crops or sell off livestock because of the lack of water.\nCpl. Lindsey Anderson is part of a two-person team that makes up the RCMP's livestock investigations unit in Alberta. They're tasked with investigating the approximately 50 cattle thefts reported in the province each year.\n\u00a0\"It happens more often than we think it does,\" she explained in an interview with CBC News. \"It's always important for producers to report anytime something does go missing.\"\nWith 85 cattle taken, the Meston case is unusual in its scope, she said.\n\"In order to steal a large quantity of cattle you have to know what you're doing. You have to have the ability to go out and round them up and you have to have the ability to transport them.\"\nWhere's the beef? How RCMP investigate cattle rustling\nCattle rustling alive and well in the Canadian West\nWhile brand inspectors will check auction markets in B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan, Harris says no such system exists in Manitoba or Ontario.\nThat makes it easier to load cattle onto trailers and sell them in those provinces, he added.\nFew cases solved, jail time rare\nAnderson says her team recovers livestock \"two or three times a year.\"\u00a0\nIn a recent case, convictions brought fines and probation.\u00a0\nIn 2020,\u00a0Andre and Monika Ribi, ranchers from the Rural Municipality of Prairie Rose, Sask.,\u00a0were charged with multiple counts of theft of cattle, trafficking stolen cattle, fraudulently marking cattle and causing animals to be in distress.\nThe case involved 29 cows stolen from five different farms.\nWATCH | Runaway cows:\n\u00a0\nRunaway cows evade capture in Quebec\n8 months ago\nDuration \n1:53\nA herd of young cows has been on the lam for months in rural Quebec, causing thousands of dollars in damage. After several failed attempts to wrangle the herd, the town has now resorted to cowboy tactics in the hopes of capturing the fugitive cattle.\nIn January 2022 they pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Andre Ribi, a former municipal councillor for Prairie Rose, received a conditional sentence of six months, and 18 months probation. Monika Ribi was fined $5,000 plus a $2,000 victim surcharge. They also had to pay restitution to cattle owners who were unable to recover their cows.\nJohn Meston is not hopeful he will get his cattle back. But he hopes his case will lead to better enforcement and more thorough investigations.\n\"If we don't get on top of this and get it stopped there won't be a cattle industry. Because why would someone spend all their life trying to build up a cattle ranch to have it stolen?\"",

She started helping out with regular practice sessions at Riley Park and had an unexpected epiphany \u2014 she was good at the game.\u00a0\n\"I was a natural bowler,\" Waqar said.\nShe ended up training for the sport and enjoying the entire process from start to finish.\n\"I find that very ironic because I went from, 'Did anyone even want to sit down and watch the sport?' to now,\" she said.\nThese days, a huge chunk of her week is spent playing cricket and organizing events.\nThe beginner's guide to the greatest pastimes: Cricket\nBrandon teen starts Manitoba's first all-female cricket team\nIt's been 13 years since Waqar first started playing cricket. She grew to love the sport so much that she decided to start a cricket league with her sister in 2010.\n\"We realized that there was nobody here for women to play cricket. So we basically got in touch with the organizers for men's cricket and we started the league,\" Waqar said.\n\"It started off with like three to four girls just coming down and training and one coach, and then we soon started recruiting more girls and actually setting up tournaments.\"\nWomen's cricket in Alberta has grown by leaps and bounds over the past few years. According to Waqar, her team is now a diverse mix of about two dozen\u00a0female players ages 12 to 35.\u00a0\n'We're definitely growing'\nThe players now end up competing in at least two to three games every week as opposed to a handful of tournaments a year \u2014 which was the case in the past.\n\"We're definitely growing. We're creating a platform where we're able to display our skills,\" Waqar said, adding she's hoping to recruit more players and start a junior program for young players.\n\"We can start grooming those players to play for Calgary and then Alberta and, eventually, the national team, because we have the pathway set up,\" she said. \"We have got the coaches, we've got the facilities.\"\nOmaima Waqar started a cricket league with her sister in 2010 when she realized that female cricket players didn't have enough support in Alberta. \n \n(David Mercer/CBC)\nWaqar, who is the vice-president of the Alberta Women's Cricket League, believes\u00a0community support can go a long way in encouraging more women to pick up the sport.\n\"We believe that when the community comes together and when [a] family starts supporting women's cricket and women's sports in general, their women, their girls, daughters, wives, sisters\u00a0\u2026 tend to want to join as well because they see that support,\" Waqar said.\nThree players from the Alberta Women's Cricket League have already qualified for the national team. According to Waqar, other high-performing players are under \"the radar\" of sports scouts.\nThe ultimate goal is simple:\u00a0to keep pushing the envelope and help more Albertan women cricket players explore their love for the game.\n'The team is great'\nMonica Arora, an experienced bowler, didn't think she'd play cricket again after moving to Canada from India several years ago.\nArora, who has been a member of national cricket teams in India and Canada, decided to chase her passion after learning about women's cricket in Calgary.\nMonica Arora, an experienced bowler and a member of Alberta\u2019s Women Cricket League, loves how cricket allows her to stay disciplined and focused.\n \n(David Mercer/CBC)\n\"When I joined this team, my joy, my happiness, my love for [the] ground, my love for cricket came back, and to me, that is a wonderful feeling,\" said the\u00a0wellness and fitness coach. \"That's [a] million-dollar feeling.\"\u00a0\nArora especially loves how cricket allows her to stay disciplined and focused while taking her out of her \"day-to-day life.\" When she's on the cricket field, she's thinking only about the game and her team members.\n\"Overall, the team is great. Everybody is amazing. Everybody has their companionship, everybody supports each other,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"You know, it's good to have those kind of people around you, especially in today's world, where it's filled with stress. Because now there's someone who's really supporting you. It doesn't matter [if] you drop a catch, doesn't matter if you didn't get a wicket \u2026 they are still there for you.\"\nPitch perfect: Cricket N.L. wants local players to help restore the province's connection to the game\nWomen's cricket in Canada usually has 120 pitches, also known as overs, per team. A game begins with a coin toss and the winner gets to decide whether they'll bowl or bat first.\nEleven players try their best to earn the maximum number of points through the course of the game while preventing their opponents from scoring more points.\u00a0\nTwo players bat at a time while bowlers from the opposing team try to take them down \u2014 if fielders catch the ball or a player hits the stumps (three wooden sticks located at either end of the field) with their ball, they're eliminated from the game and are replaced by another teammate.\nThe best way to score is to either hit the ball and try to earn extra points or run between the stumps to get more points, usually known as \"runs.\"\u00a0\nDanielle McGahey, a cricket player from Saskatchewan, first started playing cricket as a four-year-old in Australia.\n \n(David Mercer/CBC)\n\"I love the tactical side of the game,\" said Danielle McGahey, a cricket player from Saskatchewan. \"With cricket, you're never really out of the game until the very end. Something could happen. A couple of wickets fall here, a couple of big shots when batting, and the game changes.\"\nMcGahey first started playing cricket as an enthusiastic four-year-old in Australia, where her parents taught her the basic rules of the game.\n\"I've been playing for 25 years,\" she said. \"Growing up in Australia, it's part of life. It's like hockey [in Canada.]\"\nNew women's cricket league in India heralded as 'game-changer'\nThe cricket player didn't want to quit the sport after moving to Canada three years ago.\nShe reached out to the Women's Cricket League, which is how she ended up playing with cricket players in Calgary.\nWhile Saskatchewan doesn't have a full-fledged women's cricket team, McGahey is hopeful there will be more players by next year.\u00a0\n\"The women's league is still in the process of expanding and growing,\" she said. \"We had one before COVID, but, unfortunately, [the pandemic] put us backwards.\"\nMeanwhile, McGahey has made it to the national team and continues playing for Alberta on the side.\n'I can only see it going up'\nShe says playing cricket in Canada comes with its unique challenges.\n\"Playing in Canada inherently means you get a long winter, so I know a lot of the girls here train very heavily in the winter,\" she said. \"Indoor facilities exist in Calgary, in Edmonton, and that's where a lot of the girls will do their training.\"\nMcGahey believes\u00a0women's cricket is here to stay.\u00a0\n\"Even in the last, like, two years, we've had more tournaments available to us than ever before,\" she said.\nShe noted that several team members will proceed to the national games and participate in multiple tournaments across Canada.\n\"There's a lot of opportunities that are beginning to grow for the women's game,\" McGahey said. \"I can only see it going up.\"",

The social media-fuelled fusion of Greta Gerwig's \nBarbie\n\u00a0and Christopher Nolan's \nOppenheimer\n\u00a0brought moviegoers back to the theatres\u00a0in record numbers this weekend, vastly outperforming projections and giving a glimmer of hope to the lagging exhibition business, amid the sobering backdrop of strikes.\nWarner Bros.' \nBarbie\n\u00a0claimed the top spot with a massive $155 million US in ticket sales from North American theatres\u00a0from 4,243 locations, surpassing \nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n\u00a0(as well as every Marvel movie this year) as the biggest opening of the year and breaking the first weekend record for a film directed by a woman.\nUniversal's \nOppenheimer \nalso soared past expectations, taking in $80.5 million from 3,610 theatres\u00a0in the U.S. and Canada, marking Nolan's biggest non-Batman debut and one of the best-ever starts for an R-rated biographical drama.\nIt's also the first time that one movie opened to more than $100 million and another movie opened to more than $80 million in the same weekend.\nWhen all is settled, it will likely turn out to be the fourth-biggest box office weekend of all time with more than\u00a0$300 million industry-wide. And all this in a marketplace that increasingly curved toward\u00a0intellectual property-driven winner takes all.\nGroup Chat\nBarbenheimer: does the highly-anticipated double feature live up to the hype?\nThe \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon may have started out as good-natured competition between two esthetic opposites, but, as many hoped, both movies benefited in the end.\nThe only real casualty was \nMission: Impossible \u2014\u00a0Dead Reckoning Part I\n,\u00a0which despite strong reviews and a healthy opening weekend fell 64 per cent\u00a0in its second weekend. Overshadowed by the \"Barbenheimer,\" glow as well as the blow of losing its IMAX screens to \nOppenheimer\n,\u00a0the Tom Cruise vehicle added $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $118.8 million.\nDistinct audiences\n\"Barbenheimer\" is not merely counter-programming, either. But while a certain section of enthusiastic moviegoers overlapped, in aggregate the audiences were distinct.\nWomen drove the historic \nBarbie\n opening, making up 65 per cent\u00a0of the audience, according to PostTrak, and 40 per cent\u00a0of ticket buyers were under the age of 25 for the PG-13-rated movie.\n\"It's just a joyous time in the world. This is history in so many ways,\" said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.' president of domestic distribution. \"I think this marketing campaign is one for the ages that people will be talking about forever.\"\nWATCH | The cultural phenomenon that is 'Barbenheimer' explained:\n\u00a0\nWhat is \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019? The cultural phenomenon, explained\n7 days ago\nDuration \n1:47\nWith Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer set to hit theatres on July 21, CBC's Ashley Fraser unpacks why the two films have become a cultural phenomenon spawning memes, T-shirts and double-feature plans.\nOppenheimer\n audiences, meanwhile, were 62 per cent\u00a0male and 63 per cent\u00a0over the age of 25, with a somewhat surprising 32 per cent\u00a0that were between the ages of 18 and 24.\nBoth \nBarbie\n\u00a0and \nOppenheimer\n scored well with critics, with 90 per cent\u00a0and 94 per cent\u00a0on Rotten Tomatoes, respectively, and audiences who gave both films an A CinemaScore. Social media has been awash with reactions and \"takes\" all weekend \u2014 good, bad, problematic and everywhere in between \u2014 the kind of organic, event cinema, water-cooler debate that no marketing budget can buy.\n\"The 'Barbenheimer' thing was a real boost for both movies,\" Goldstein said. \"It is a crowning achievement for all of us.\"\nComeback weekend for Hollywood\nOppenheimer\n\u00a0had the vast majority (80 per cent) of premium large-format screens at its disposal. Some 25 theatres\u00a0in North America boasted IMAX 70mm screenings (Nolan's preferred format), most of which were completely sold out all weekend \u2014 accounting for two\u00a0per cent\u00a0of the total gross. Theatres\u00a0even scrambled to add more to accommodate the demand, including 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. screenings, which also sold out.\n\"Nolan's films are truly cinematic events,\" said Jim Orr, Universal's president of domestic distribution.\nREVIEW\nThe duality of Barbie? A delightfully berserk movie with a Mattel problem\nIMAX showings alone made up 26 per cent\u00a0of the domestic gross (or $21.1 million) from only 411 screens and 20 per cent\u00a0of the global gross, and \nOppenheimer\n\u00a0will have at least a three-week run on those high-demand screens.\n\"This is a phenomenon beyond compare,\" Rich Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX, said in a statement. \"Around the world, we've seen sellouts at 4\u00a0a.m. shows and people travelling hours across borders to see \nOppenheimer\n\u00a0in IMAX 70mm.\"\nWATCH | Torn\u00a0between Barbie and Oppenheimer? Let these reviews help:\n\u00a0\nBarbie or Oppenheimer? These reviews can help if you\u2019re torn\n4 days ago\nDuration \n6:41\nThe simultaneous blockbuster release of the Barbie and Oppenheimer has sparked debate among fans about what movie you should watch first in your 'Barbenheimer' binge. CBC film critics Eli Glasner and Jackson Weaver share their take.\nThis is the comeback weekend Hollywood has been dreaming of since the pandemic. There have been big openings and successes \u2014 \nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n,\u00a0\nTop Gun: Maverick\n,\u00a0\nAvatar: The Way of Water\n among them \u2014 but the fact that two movies are succeeding at the same time is notable.\n\"It was a truly historic weekend and continues the positive box office momentum of 2023,\" said Michael O'Leary, president and\u00a0CEO of the National Association of Theatre Owners. \"People recognized that something special was happening and they wanted to be a part of it.\"\nStudios pushing some movies due to strikes\nAnd yet in the background looms disaster as Hollywood studios continue to squabble with striking actors and writers over a fair contract.\nBarbie\n\u00a0and \nOppenheimer\n\u00a0were the last films on the 2023 calendar to get a massive, global press tour. Both went right up to the 11th hour, squeezing in every last moment with their movie stars.\nOppenheimer\n\u00a0even pushed up its London premiere by an hour, knowing that Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy would have to leave to symbolically join the picket lines by the time the movie began.\nREVIEW\nBleak, beautiful Oppenheimer tells us about our apocalyptic future\nWithout movie stars to promote their films, studios have started pushing some fall\u00a0releases, including the high-profile Zendaya tennis drama \nChallengers\n.\nBut for now, it's simply a positive story that could even continue for weeks to come.\n\"There could be a sequel next weekend,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \"The FOMO\u00a0(fear of missing out) factor will rachet up because of this monumental box office event centred around the movie theatre experience.\"",

For years,\u00a0he has led\u00a0groups under various names, including al-Muhajiroun, Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades.\nIn 2016, he was\u00a0sentenced\u00a0to 5 and a half\u00a0years in prison for encouraging support for the group\u00a0Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\nSeveral people who attended Choudary's rallies and events have been convicted of violent attacks. They include\u00a0a\u00a0pair of al-Qaeda-inspired killers who\u00a0\nran over British soldier Lee Rigby\n\u00a0and stabbed him to death in 2013.\u00a0\nAl-Muhajiroun\nIn January 2010 and November\u00a02011, the British government issued\u00a0orders requiring that Al-Muhajiroun, Islam4UK, Call to Submission, Islamic Path, London School of Sharia and Muslims Against Crusades\u00a0be treated as alternative names for the same organization.\nThe group has been proscribed also under the names Al-Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect.\nAccording to the British government, Al-Muhajiroun first emerged in the U.K.\u00a0in 1996. It was led by \nradical Islamic preacher Omar Bakri Muhammed\n, who publicly disbanded the organization in 2004.\u00a0\nThe U.K. Home Office said the organization reformed in 2004 under the names Al-Ghurabaa and the Saved Sect and is based in and operates from the U.K.",

So we have to be extremely careful and cautious with this population.\"\nAccording to Ghosh, who works with marginalized Albertans, opioids can leave people vulnerable to the elements\u00a0because they often pass out, putting them at risk of heat stroke. Other drugs, such as crystal meth and cocaine, can also worsen heat stroke.\nDr. Monty Ghosh is an assistant professor in the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary. He also works with marginalized populations in Calgary.\n \n(Monty Gosh)\nSome of the latest drugs to enter the province's supply also increase the danger level, he said.\nThe animal tranquilizer\u00a0xylazine, which has been dubbed\u00a0'\ntranq-dope,\n' makes it more difficult for the body to cool itself, according to Ghosh.\nAnd\u00a0benzodiazepines leave people more sedated and less able to protect themselves from the heat, he added.\n\"Not only were things cooler about 10 years ago, but the toxicity of the drug supply was much more predictable,\" he said.\n\"It is sort of a perfect storm \u2014\u00a0bad scenario \u2014 that can just worsen because of the heat.\"\nGhosh said cooling stations would help.\n\"As temperatures do ... continue to rise, we may need to start looking at more air-conditioned spaces to support this population and more cooling tents, for example, as well.\"\nHe's urging Albertans\u00a0to be vigilant and check on people who appear to be in trouble.\n\"Showing them that you care, providing them with an extra bottle of water if you have one with you,\" said\u00a0Gosh.\n\"One thing the average person can do is show them compassion.... It's that extra step that often makes a huge difference in their world.\"",

        "content": "Data from the Workers' Compensation Board of Alberta shows more people in the province have been reporting workplace injuries. The average claim duration, which is the\u00a0length of time an injured worker receives wage loss replacement benefits, increased by almost 85 per cent between 2015 and 2022.\u00a0\nThe statistic refers to only lost-time claims, meaning it does not include cases where people return to work the day after an accident.\nThe average lost-time claim duration increased steadily from 2015 until 2021, then remained the same in 2022.\u00a0\nIn 2015, the average injured worker received wage loss replacement benefits from the WCB for 34 days. The average claim duration for the past two years has been 63 days.\nBen Dille, team lead of engagement and development at the WCB, said multiple factors contribute to claim duration, but the economy is a major one.\n\"When the economy is weaker, there are fewer suitable return-to-work options that are available for injured workers as they're trying to reintegrate back into the workforce,\" Dille said in an interview with CBC News.\n\"And conversely, when the economy is stronger, those positions are more readily available and so people will tend to go back to work faster and they don't remain on WCB benefits for quite as long.\"\nBob Barnetson, a labour relations professor at Athabasca University, said there was less work available in general during the first two years of the pandemic thus, fewer jobs would have been available for injured workers.\n\"That, of course, would extend claim duration,\" he said.\nKevin Becker, a former WCB case manager who now runs Alberta Workers' Compensation Consulting, said an influx of COVID-19 related claims and staff turnover could have also contributed to the increase in claim duration.\nBecker advocates for injured workers by reviewing their files and representing them during appeals.\n\"What I see over and over again is the claim files changing hands repeatedly,\" he said.\nHe said those changes, among other reasons, can lead to delays and longer active claims.\nDille said like many employers, the WCB has experienced \"a decent amount\" of turnover, particularly with claim staff, and the organization is working to train less experienced case managers and adjudicators.\nThe WCB's premium rates highlight sheet\n\u00a0for employers said the rising volume and duration of claims \"drove a significant rise in the cost of workplace illness and injuries\" last year.\u00a0\nClaim volume increased by about a third in 2022, compared to the year before, and it has increased by about 50 per cent since 2019.\u00a0\nTo cover the budgeted cost of workplace illnesses and injuries this year, the WCB told employers it would need to increase the average employer premium rate. It did so, but also gave employers $273.4 million in subsidies.\nOver the past six years, employers have received $1.6 billion in WCB subsidies.\nTour bus company pleads guilty to 2 OHS charges in glacier bus rollover\nThe C-word: firefighters push for better cancer protection\nMost Albertans injured at work don't make lost-time claims since they return to work immediately.\nThat was the case for Dale Dacey, who lives in Lethbridge and injured his arm while lifting and throwing bags of sugar beets onto a conveyor belt in October.\nDacey said he went back to work at his seasonal job in the town of Taber, hoping his arm, which felt like it had pins and needles running up and down it, would improve. When it didn't, he made a claim with WCB, but it was after the work season had ended.\u00a0\nHe said some injuries take much longer to heal than others and there can be long wait times for specialists.\nDacey said his arm is improving, after months of physical therapy.\u00a0\nHe's planning to return to work when the season begins again in September and is grateful for the targeted treatment he has received through the WCB.\n\"They have helped me,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"I just hope that it works for everybody.\"",

That's what the industry wants clarity on. Alberta has also committed about $2 billion into carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and approved 25 proposals for carbon storage hubs.\u00a0\nCCUS technology traps and stores pollution from production underground.

And then we have lost on two fronts: We have lost a global leadership opportunity \u2026 and we have not abated an iota of CO2.\"\u00a0\nA \nrecent report \ncommissioned by an environmental group concluded it would be significantly cheaper to meet reduction targets for greenhouse gases than it would be to pay carbon taxes on it.\nLeach said the path forward depends on whether decisions are influenced more by politics or by global market and environmental factors.\u00a0\nThat question rests largely with the industry.\n\"Is decarbonizing the oilsands something that has to happen for the future of the industry or is it something that has to happen so long as the current Liberal government makes it a priority,\" he said.\nEvans remains optimistic the governments and companies can find a path forward.\u00a0\n\"I have never heard a federal official tell me that they want to see production shut in and clearly the premier doesn't either. So with those basics, I feel we're going to be able to thread the needle here.\"\u00a0",

        "summary": "The company behind a $70-million project says it will reduce feedlot odours, but a residents' group opposing the plan worries it will make the smell worse.",
        "content": "A group of High River residents is pushing back against plans to add a $70-million biogas facility to a nearby feedlot operation, worried it will make the odour coming from the property worse.\nRimrock Cattle Feeders Inc. proposes to build a large biodigester facility next to the feedlot that it operates on the site. It will process manure into what it calls renewable natural gas and something called digestate, a fertilizer and soil amendment.\nLast fall, Rimrock's parent company, Tidewater Renewables Ltd., signed a deal with FortisBC for the purchase of the gas, though the facility has yet to be approved and is still being reviewed by Alberta Environment and Protected Areas.\n\"It will not only reduce odours significantly but also provide a safe and renewable energy source for many years to come,\" project manager\u00a0John Del Mastro said during a presentation to Foothills County in January.\nVideo\nThese plants soak up nutrients from manure. They may make feedlot water clean enough to drink\nAlberta regulator rejects feedlot application near Pigeon Lake\nBut some people who live in the area aren't convinced \u2014 and nearly 2,000 have signed a petition against the project, which would be located on a property roughly six kilometres away from the town's western boundary.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\"Our concern is, if we're smelling all of this putrid stench now, what are we going to be exposed to when you have a biogas plant just down the road?\" asked Laura Brankovich, who lives on the northwestern edge of High River.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nLaura Brankovich lives in northwest High River. She describes the smells from the Rimrock Feeders feedlot as a putrid stench and is hoping something can be done to mitigate the odours.\n \n(Bryan Labby/CBC)\nFuture model for feedlots\nIf approved later this year, the proposed biodigester will process up to 80,000 tonnes of manure and 60,000 tonnes of trucked-in organic waste every year, according to the company's\u00a0application to Alberta Environment and Protected Areas.\nWhile the project is still under review, it has already secured $13.4 million in funding from two grants from Emissions Reduction Alberta, a provincial agency that funds clean technology solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe agency says the system, which includes rolled-compacted concrete flooring for the pens to help manure collection, along with the biodigester,\u00a0will serve as a model for other feedlots in Alberta.\u00a0\nThe agency says the biodigester will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year by producing renewable natural gas, displacing fossil natural gas and by diverting organic waste from the landfill.\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe entrance to Rimrock Feeders Inc. near High River. \n \n(Bryan Labby/CBC)\n\"It's great to see all of the innovation happening right here in Alberta \u2026 and ag is no exception as reducing methane emissions while producing an enhanced fertilizer is a win-win,\" Environment and Protected Areas Minister Rebecca Schulz said in a\n \nsocial media post\n after a luncheon at the Rimrock facility this month.\nA spokesperson for the company said she was unavailable to comment.\u00a0However, the project team told Foothills County in January it expects the project will reduce odours by 42 per cent.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nYet some residents are more than wary about the project after years of living near the feedlot operation. They don't want to see the biogas facility proceed.\u00a0\nHundreds of complaints\nOne of the feedlot's most vocal opponents is Benita Estes, whose home is about 200 metres from the feedlot's property.\u00a0\n\"You're torturing a community,\" she said of the smells wafting from the feedlot.\u00a0 \n\"You've got people here who have bought and are retired, who'd like to sit out on their decks, who would like to have their families over for barbecues, who would like to entertain, or at least, you know, enjoy the comforts of their space, and they can't go outside.\"\nThe residents' campaign against the project includes the website, \nStop That Smell\n, which encourages residents to file odour complaints with the Natural Resources Conservation Board, the agency responsible for regulating confined feeding operations in the province.\nIn the past year, the board has received 1,200 odour complaints about the facility.\u00a0\nBenita Estes lives approximately 200 metres from a proposed biodigester facility west of High River. Estes has been a vocal opponent of the Rimrock Feeders feedlot and expansion plans.\n \n(Bryan Labby/CBC)\nThe regulator purchased a new odour testing device in response to the complaints. It made several visits to the feedlot, some unannounced. It's met with residents who've filed complaints.\n\"We're collecting a lot of data, we're talking to a lot of people,\" said Kevin Seward, a compliance manager with the board. \"We've been on site numerous times. We're looking at different management practices at the feedlot. So we are doing a lot.\"\u00a0\nThe board says preliminary monitoring data collected through May and June\u00a0shows there's no risk to human health, with readings for ammonia, volatile organic carbons and carbon disulfide all within acceptable guidelines.\nIt\u00a0says it will continue to monitor odours in the area in the coming weeks with a second new air quality monitoring station along with 14 passive sensors.\u00a0\n\"People [who live in High River] are telling us this year that the odour is not as bad this summer as it was last summer, it's not as pungent,\" Seward said.\u00a0\nEnvironment and Protected Areas Minister Rebecca Schulz, third from right, is pictured at an event hosted by Rimrock Feeders on July 11. \n \n(Facebook)\nSome opponents of the project told CBC News they felt gutted by the environment minister's decision to attend the luncheon at the Rimrock facility and then post on \nsocial media\n that the proposal is a win-win when the company's project has yet to receive final approval.\nIn a statement to CBC News, a spokesperson for Schulz said the minister is not involved in the review process, and \"we look forward to Alberta Environment and Protected Areas releasing their decision in the coming months.\"\n\"We have complete faith in the province's robust regulatory review process,\" the statement said. \"This work is done by the department, as the regulator, not the ministry.\"\nIn the meantime, Estes intends to battle on.\nShe said the odour data collected by the Natural Resources Conservation Board doesn't provide her comfort as the equipment is new and its findings are preliminary.\u00a0She said her campaign to stop the biogester project will continue.\u00a0\nSo far, more than $12,000 has been raised to cover legal costs. Their goal is $75,000.\nA decision on the fate of the biodigester is expected later this year.",

Benzen resigned and vacated the seat \nlate last year\n, citing a desire to\u00a0return to private business and family life.\nCalgary Heritage has tradtionally been a safe seat for the Conservative Party, having been taken by the Tories by comfortable margins each of the four times it has been contested since 2015\u00a0\u2014\u00a0three times by Benzen and once by Harper.\nThe electoral district, formerly dubbed\u00a0Calgary Southwest,\u00a0was established following federal electoral redistribution in 2012. However, the riding largely occupies\u00a0same area as its predecessor,\u00a0which\u00a0Harper held from 2003 until 2015.\u00a0\nCalgary Southwest\u00a0was also the seat of Preston Manning, who led the old\u00a0Reform Party.\nConservative candidate Bob Benzen speaks after winning the federal byelection riding of Calgary Heritage in 2017 following the resignation of former prime minister Stephen Harper. In the 2021 election, Benzen\u00a0won the riding with 57.7\u00a0per cent of the vote, well ahead of his closest rival, NDP candidate\u00a0Kathleen Johnson, who took 17.4 per cent.\n \n(Todd Korol/The Canadian Press)\nStill,\u00a0political analysts and party officials will be keeping an eye on things like voter turnout, momentum\u00a0or\u00a0changes in vote share, looking for trends or whether certain messages resonate with people.\nPolls are open on Monday from\u00a08:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.\u00a0Advance voting took place from\u00a0July 14 to 17, and the estimated number of electors who voted at advance polling in the riding was 8,966, according to Elections Canada.\nThat number will be updated after the election once the results are verified.\nThe federal electoral district of Calgary Heritage is located in the southwest portion of the city.\n \n(CBC News)\nThe candidates\nShuvaloy Majumdar is a longtime Conservative staffer who has worked at Harper & Associates, the former prime minister Harper's consulting firm, since 2016.\u00a0Prior to that, he worked in foreign affairs in the Harper government. He won the party's nomination in March.\nIn various videos posted to his YouTube channel, Majumdar advocated for changes to Canada's energy policies, admonished what he\u00a0referred to as a \"woke wave of tyranny\" in the country, and promised his party would work to reduce the cost of living.\n\"I'm running because I'm inspired by our leadership,\u00a0by Pierre Poilievre, a man who I've known for 25 years,\" Majumdar \nsaid in a video\n.\nA spokesperson for Majumdar said the candidate would not be doing interviews until July 25.\nKnocking doors with common sense Conservative candidate Shuv Majumdar &amp; our great team of volunteers in Calgary Heritage.<br><br>Workers &amp; seniors in my hometown are ready to axe the Trudeau tax.<br><br>Let's bring it home. <a href=\"https://t.co/05yZP3xvwy\">pic.twitter.com/05yZP3xvwy</a>\n&mdash;\n@PierrePoilievre\nElliot Weinstein,\u00a0the federal Liberal Party candidate, suggested his small business experience might draw undecided voters to his side.\u00a0\nWeinstein is the owner of a\u00a0Calgary-based indoor beach recreation facility, The Beach YYC, and was previously a project manager at consulting firm\u00a0Golder Associates.

A lot of people here in Calgary Heritage, they vote conservative\u00a0because that's how their grandparents voted, that's how\u00a0their parents voted, that's how they're going to vote,\" Bhachu said.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, right, pictured with Gurmit Bhachu, the NDP candidate in  the federal riding of Calgary Heritage.\n \n(Facebook)\nIn addition to Majumdar, Weinstein and Bhachum, other candidates in the riding include:\nRavenmoon Crocker, Green Party of Canada.\nDan Irving, Maverick Party.\nKelly Lorencz, People's Party of Canada.\nLarry Heather, Christian Heritage Party of Canada.\nEarlier this year, four byelections took place across Canada, with the\u00a0Liberals and\u00a0Conservatives \ntaking two\u00a0seats apiece\n.

It's got a long list of fairly high-profile conservatives that have represented it federally,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"But it also overlaps with a riding, Calgary-Glenmore, that is represented right now provincially by an NDP candidate, a very strong NDP candidate [Nagwan Al-Guneid], who won by a squeaker, but nevertheless won in this riding. So there's a lot of diversity here.\"\nInformation on where to vote is\u00a0\navailable here\n\u00a0from Elections Canada.",

But it was also just one of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 calls to action, and \"there's a whole bunch more to go.\"\nAfter the Pope spoke in Maskwacis on July 25, 2022, he visited the Sacred Heart Church of the First Peoples in Edmonton, and travelled to Lac Ste. Anne, a sacred site for several First Nations and nearby M\u00e9tis settlements, during the annual pilgrimage to the lake.\nAlexis Nakota Sioux Nation Chief Tony Alexis said the Pope's apology, and the subsequent repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery this year, fulfil\u00a0some of the long-standing demands of the head of the Catholic Church.\nThe Doctrine of Discovery is a legal concept, backed by 15th-century papal bulls, that justified Europeans' claiming of Indigenous lands.\nBut a year later, \"I don't see the true impact of it,\" Alexis said. \"The Church could do more of building that bridge of that reconciliation.\"\nAs a chief, he said his responsibility is to reflect the varied reactions and mixed emotions that persist among his people.\n\"We can go on any one of those paths and each one would have its own story,\" he said.\nAlexis Nakota Sioux Nation Chief Tony Alexis and Pope Francis are shown meeting in St. Peter's Square in 2016. Chief Alexis says the Catholic Church could still do more when it comes to building the bridge of reconciliation.\n \n(Vatican Radio Facebook)\n\"For the Catholic faith, a miracle has happened that Pope Francis came here. For the ones that are harmed, we could say that it's not enough, and so there's much work that needs to be done. And for the ones that practice their ceremonies and so on, for them, they will not be told how to behave again.\"\n'We did survive a genocide'\nErmineskin Cree Nation member Josh Littlechild watched the Pope's address remotely with his father, a residential school survivor.\nLittlechild is also the nephew of Honorary Chief Wilton Littlechild of Ermineskin Cree Nation, a former Truth and Reconciliation Commission member who was among the Indigenous delegates who travelled to Rome last spring to ask that the Pope apologize for the Church's role in the residential school system in Canada.\n'A dramatic shift': Residential school survivor, Indigenous leader respond to Pope's use of word genocide\nPope Francis apologizes for forced assimilation of Indigenous children at residential schools\nJosh Littlechild said it took time for him to process his own reaction to hearing Pope Francis's words last year. But he imagines children studying the impact of the visit decades from now, and says he feels optimistic about change for the future.\nBut he points to another significant moment \u2014 when the Pope was about to fly back to Rome, and he acknowledged that the forced assimilation of Indigenous children in residential schools was genocide.\n\"I didn't use the word genocide because it didn't come to mind but I described genocide,\" Pope Francis told reporters.\nErmineskin Cree Nation member Josh Littlechild said it took time for him to process his own reaction to hearing Pope Francis\u2019s words last year. But he says he feels optimistic about change for the future.\n \n(Alysia Lafleche)\n\"We did survive a genocide,\" Littlechild said. \"So that acknowledgement that comes with truth and reconciliation \u2014 the truth came out.\n\"In my opinion, more and more people in Canada just have to plainly call it what it is. It's a genocide.\"\nPope says genocide took place at Canada's residential schools\nLuci Johnson, a Samson Cree Nation member and day school survivor, attended the pontiff's apology in person.\nShe spoke up against the Pope's presence at the time, and she still feels the apology came far too late for many who suffered at residential schools, including both her parents, who are now deceased.\nBut she said ultimately, she needed to be there for her family.\n\"The same day, I went to both where my mom is buried and where my grandmother is buried and I said, 'I saw the Pope for you.'\"\nLuci Johnson, left, with her oldest daughter Paula Johnson-Jefferson, at Pope Francis\u2019s address in Maskwacis, Alta., on July 25, 2022.\n \n(Supplied by Luci Johnson)\nJohnson said she remains focused on tangible action that will help the generations of Indigenous people still suffering from the deep, lasting harms of residential schools. She said she still doesn't see nearly enough support for desperately needed prevention programs and efforts to help people reconnect with their culture and language.\nLittlechild, too, said there are more concrete steps he'd like to see. Lately, he said he's been thinking about how it should be a priority for services at the Catholic church in Maskwacis to be done in Cree.\n\"I'm thinking, moving forward, the people who destroyed the language, that took it away, they should be responsible for putting it back now.\"\nJohnson said there will never be justice for what her parents experienced at residential schools. But she won't stop raising her voice about the work that she says the Catholic Church and the Canadian government still have to do.\n\"Keep that 'sorry' going through the communities,\" she said.\n\"If the people of the magnitude and power came in and say, 'I know the Pope came in ... but how can I help you?'\n\"We don't see that. Once the fanfare's done, it's done.\"\nA national Indian Residential School Crisis Line is available to provide support for survivors and those affected.

        "summary": "As the Canadian and Alberta health-care systems struggle under the weight of increased pressure, experts say arrangements like paid memberships being offered at a Calgary clinic are becoming increasingly common.",
        "content": "Calgarian Robin Arseneault visited her doctor's office in Marda Loop recently for a routine physical.\u00a0\nAlong with her husband, Robert, the Arseneaults visit the neighbourhood clinic often. That's because\u00a0Robert has high medical needs as someone with primary progressive MS, heart and bladder dysfunction, diabetes and kidney concerns.\u00a0\nSo the couple was surprised\u00a0to see an email land from the Marda Loop Medical Clinic in their inbox that same week, stating that the clinic would be moving to a membership system.\nWhat has your experience been with private health care in Canada, and what questions do you have? We want to hear from you. Email ask@cbc.ca\nThe pricing under that membership, shared\u00a0with CBC News by Arseneault, is listed as\u00a0$4,800 per year for a two-parent family membership, which covers two adults and their dependent children.\nOther memberships include a $2,400-per-year membership that covers one adult and their dependent children, and $2,200 per year for an individual adult membership.\n\"First off, we can't afford $4,000 a year,\"\u00a0Arseneault said. \"Secondly, I fundamentally disagree with that tiered system of health care. I can't stand the idea that if I have more money, I get more privileged care, than say, my neighbour. It's just against my beliefs.\"\nBankview resident Robin Arseneault says she was shocked to learn her clinic would soon start offering a membership-based medical service, something she and her husband won't be proceeding with. But she said that's upsetting, as the two have established a strong relationship with their doctor.\n \n(Submitted by Robin Arseneault)\nIn return for the membership, the Marda Loop Medical Clinic promises reduced wait times and\u00a0extended appointment times, among other benefits. The clinic also says it will continue to\u00a0provide care one day a week for non-members.\nCBC News was told an administrator at the clinic wasn't available for an interview. In an email sent to the clinic's members,\u00a0Dr. Sally Talbot-Jones wrote that the clinic's aim was to alleviate stress expressed by patients due to extended waiting times, the challenge of scheduling family appointments, and more.\n\"This decision was driven by my commitment to providing you with the level of care you deserve. I have extensively researched the most successful health care models around the world, and I am confident that our new program is designed to deliver excellence,\" Talbot-Jones wrote.\nAudio\nCanadians turn to fee-charging private clinics to access health care\nThe program at the Marda Loop clinic isn't the first along these lines in Calgary. Such arrangements date back years\u00a0and they aren't all structured in the same way.\nBut as the Canadian and Alberta health-care systems struggle under the weight of increased pressure\u00a0\u2014 whether that's\u00a0\nrural emergency room closures\n, \nambulance shortages\n, or\u00a0\noverwhelmed hospitals\n\u00a0\u2014 experts say arrangements like the one being offered at the Marda Loop clinic are becoming increasingly common.\n'Skirting the boundaries' of what's allowable\nBack in 2008, Alberta's health minister at the time was asked whether he had any concerns about a private clinic, the\u00a0Copeman Healthcare Centre,\u00a0opening up shop in downtown Calgary, \ncharging $2,900 per year\n.\nThe clinics didn't contravene the Canada Health Act because they didn't charge patients for medically necessary services, CEO Don Copeman said at the time.\u00a0\nGiven that, then-Alberta health minister Ron Liepert said there should be little need for such clinics if Alberta made changes to its publicly funded health-care system.\n\"The findings were that there was no contravention of the Canada Health Act so I wouldn't be proposing to do any kind of review,\" Liepert said.\nRon Liepert, pictured in 2014, after winning the federal Conservative nomination in Calgary Signal Hill. Prior to his time as an MP, Liepert was Alberta's health minister.\n \n(Larry MacDougal/Canadian Press)\nThe Canada Health Act\n\u00a0stipulates that patients can't be charged for \"medically necessary\" services, provided in a hospital or by a doctor.\nThere are some blurred lines here, though, when it comes to privatization in Canada.\nConsider services like chiropractic services, which are \nnot deemed medically necessary\n\u00a0and aren't\u00a0covered in Alberta, meaning patients have to pay for those themselves\u00a0or through private insurance.\nIf private health-care providers charge patients for medically necessary services, the provinces that allow that \nhave dollars\u00a0clawed back\n by the federal government.\n\"So, it is not allowable that you would charge a patient as they come in to see a doctor for the care that you provide them,\"\u00a0said Fiona Clement, a professor who specializes in health policy in the department of community health sciences at the University of Calgary.\u00a0\n\"But what is being tried, and I think kind of skirting the bounds of what's allowable,\u00a0are these membership fees.\"\nControversial, but no clear policy to regulate\nSince the\u00a0Copeman Healthcare Centre opened in 2008, many more such arrangements have followed\u00a0\u2014 in Alberta\u00a0and across the country.\nIn 2022, researchers from Dalhousie University and Simon Fraser University \nreleased a paper\n\u00a0tracking the number of clinics taking private payment across the country.\nAt the time of the analysis, which was between November 2019 and June 2020,\u00a0there were 14 private clinics in Alberta with a range of membership fees and private payment. During that same period, there were 24 in Ontario and 30 in Quebec.\n\"While reports have documented the operation of corporate or boutique clinics in Alberta and Ontario, we do not yet have national information on the extent of these practices,\" the authors wrote in the report.\nIn any effort to document the number of such operations,\u00a0there would be some error and misclassification involved, Clement noted, as there's no formal registry list\u00a0and no necessity to register this sort of approach.\nFiona Clement, a professor at the University of Calgary in the department of community health sciences, says the biggest impact of a clinic transitioning to a membership model would be felt by the individuals who wouldn't be equipped to afford it.\n \n(Riley Brandt/University of Calgary)\nThere have been ebbs and flows in the conversation at a policy level about what to do about this issue, Clement noted, but added everyone's a little bit hamstrung, as technically there's nothing wrong with what's happening.\n\"The college who deals with governing the professionals and making sure that doctors are adhering to their professional ethics, they're still offering medically necessary care, and they're not charging patients,\" Clement said.\n\"So there's technically no violation there. So, I really think it would have to come from the government to sort of ban these kinds of things.\"\nWhen the\u00a0Copeman Healthcare Centre opened in 2008, a Calgary spokesperson with Friends of Medicare, a\u00a0public health care advocacy group,\u00a0 bemoaned the trend.\u00a0It questioned\u00a0whether society wanted to allow people who have an \"extra $3,000 to spend [to go] to\u00a0the front of the line and everybody else can fall where they may.\"\nThe group is increasingly concerned today.\nChris Gallaway, executive director of Friends of Medicare, believes\u00a0such arrangements are\u00a0\"a violation of the Canada Health Act\" and called for them to be investigated.\n\"We shouldn't be creating two tiers, where some people pay to get into a certain clinic that others can't access,\" he said.\u00a0\nProvince says it will continue to monitor situation\nIn a statement, a spokesperson with\u00a0Alberta Health Minister Adriana LaGrange wrote that the government remains committed to the principles of the Canada Health Act, adding that Albertans don't need to pay out of pocket for insured health services.\n\"All physicians must also follow standards of practice set by their regulatory colleges. The government will continue examine these cases to make sure all legislation is being followed,\"\u00a0Scott Johnston, press secretary for LaGrange, wrote in a statement.\nThe Alberta NDP held a media availability in Calgary on Monday to draw attention to the clinic's decision to charge membership fees, saying it was \"very concerned\" other clinics might follow suit.\nWhile the province says it will monitor\u00a0developments, one health policy expert says it's not surprising to see some doctors experiment with these kinds of solutions given the pressures they are under in terms of patient demand and rising financial costs.\n\"A combination of pressures related to increasing rental prices, and for increasing staff wages, as well as just general inflation in their daily lives, I think there is a pretty large pressure to increase revenues, however possible,\" said Rosalie Wyonch, lead of the health policy research program at the C. D. Howe Institute public policy think tank.\nRosalie Wyonch, lead of the health policy research program at the C. D. Howe Institute public policy think tank, says the responsibility for ensuring equitable healthcare services lies with the government, as they can determine which services should be publicly covered without fees.\n \n(Rob Krbavac/CBC)\nIn provinces across Canada, there is a lot of grey area about what makes up a full,\u00a0publicly-insured service, what could what is definitely a private service, and\u00a0what could be either-or, Wyonch noted.\n\"All of that uncertainty, it creates in some cases opportunities to generate revenue or improve access to services with some fees,\" she said.\n\"It could also create equity concerns in terms of only being able to access services if you can afford one of these concierge services.\"\nIn the midst of all this uncertainty, some patients like the Arseneaults worry they'll be\u00a0left behind, without many options in front of them.\n\"I mean, we enjoy our doctor, we get good services from the clinic. And, yeah, it's a upsetting situation,\" Arseneault said.\n\"It's actually quite frightening. And it causes a lot of stress for us.\"\nWATCH |\u00a0How do we solve the family doctor shortage?\u00a0\nHow do we solve the family doctor shortage?\n2 months ago\nDuration \n13:26\nMany Canadians still don\u2019t have access to a family doctor.

Stuart Green, spokesperson for the TTC, said Tuesday the injured people were treated for \"severe bumps and bruises\" and taken to hospital as a precaution.\nThe TTC\u00a0has replaced all of the RT with shuttle buses running from Kennedy to McCowan stations. The closure will remain in place until further notice.\n\"It is going to be at least a few days,\" Green told CBC Radio's\u00a0\nMetro Morning\n. The agency has already begun exploring what went wrong with the help of outside experts who specialize in train derailments.\n\"The damage was significant. We need to know exactly what caused it. Was it something to do with age? Something to do with infrastructure? Was it the vehicle? All of that is under investigation,\" Green said. \"At this point we just don't know what caused it.\"\nA view of the derailed car.\n \n(CBC)\nGreen added that there are internal conversations happening about whether the light rail service will be\u00a0resumed at all.\nUniversity of Toronto engineering professor Amer Shalaby said the current Scarborough Rapid Transit line has been running much longer than what it was designed for.\n\"We have waited far too long and debated too much on how and what should replace the Scarborough RT,\" he wrote in an emailed statement.\n\"I guess what happened is a lesson on the risks associated with inefficient decision making for our strategic transit projects.\"\nLine 3 is a 6.4-kilometre rapid transit line with six stations that opened in 1985. Its trains have been in service 10 years past their design life, according to the TTC's own website. The line is scheduled to be\u00a0decommissioned in November and is set to be replaced by buses until the Scarborough Subway Extension is finished, likely in 2030 at the earliest.\nGreen said the November timeline would\u00a0give the city time to prepare, including altering traffic signals and installing more rapid bus lanes. It also would give the TTC\u00a0leeway to\u00a0reroute other buses and\u00a0allocate the staff and resources needed to operate the replacement bus network, he said.\nGreen added that the TTC currently has capacity to move up its timeline if need be, but cautioned it would take some time to implement the bus network the agency intends to replace the RT.\n\"We know how to run a shuttle service, but it's not going to be the best shuttle service,\" he told guest host Eli Glasner.\u00a0\"But it won't be the kind of service that our customers deserve.\"\nToronto wants province to reimburse TTC for $2.9M needed for Scarborough busway design\nAnalysis\nScarborough's aging RT could be replaced by priority bus lanes. Here's what you need to know\nThe derailed train car was removed from the tracks overnight, with crews examining the tracks.\nIn a statement Monday, TTC CEO\u00a0Rick Leary apologized to those who were onboard the train that derailed and transit riders\u00a0rely on the RT to get around.\u00a0\n\"I want to apologize to all those impacted by this incident and to assure our customers that safety is always paramount to all we do,\" Leary said.\nDeputy Fire Chief Jim Jessop told reporters at the scene the train \"flipped off the tracks.\"\nPassengers \"were thrown inside when it happened, and our crews were able to assist them getting out and then deliver them to the care of paramedic services,\" Jessop said.",

The board also called\u00a0Bilkszto a strong student advocate over his 24-year career.\nLawsuit launched against TDSB earlier this year\nBilkszto filed a lawsuit against the TDSB earlier this year, related to a 2021 online anti-racism training session where he claims to have been implicitly referred to as a white supremacist by the trainer and berated in front of his colleagues when he disagreed that Canada was more racist than the United States.\nHe alleged the TDSB failed to investigate his workplace harassment claim and then retaliated by disinviting him from a graduation for a program he helped create and revoking a temporary contract offer.\nThe claim alleges he started a sick leave after the training session and was diagnosed with anxiety secondary to a traumatic workplace event.\nThe consulting firm hired to conduct the training session did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIf you or someone you know is struggling, here's where to get help:\n \nTalk Suicide Canada\n: 1-833-456-4566 (phone) | 45645 (text between 4 p.m. and midnight ET).\n \n \nKids Help Phone: 1-800-668-6868 (phone), live chat counselling on\u00a0\nthe website\n.\n \n \nCanadian Association for Suicide Prevention:\u00a0\nFind a 24-hour crisis centre.\n \n \nThis guide from the\u00a0\nCentre for Addiction and Mental Health\n\u00a0outlines how to talk about suicide with someone you're worried about.\n ",

        "content": "The man who assaulted worshippers at a mosque in Mississauga, Ont., last year with bear spray and an axe has been sentenced to eight years in prison.\nJustice Bruce Durno delivered the sentence during a hearing at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Brampton on Tuesday. The length of the sentence conforms with a joint recommendation submitted by the Crown and defence.\n\"This was a targeted attack on all the congregants of the Islamic Centre, the worshippers present at the time, and on some of the values held dear by Canadians,\" Sarah Shaikh, a federal prosecutor with the Public Prosecution Service of Canda said in a statement.\n\"The sentence reflects the seriousness of the offence and society's condemnation for such attacks.\"\nMohammad Moiz Omar\u00a0\"intended to perpetrate a mass casualty event\" when he entered the Dar Al-Tawheed Islamic Centre\u00a0during early morning prayer on March 19, 2022 and sprayed bear spray toward congregants while swinging a hatchet, according to an agreed statement of facts.\nAccording to the statement, he was motivated by an intense hatred for and desire to intimidate Muslims, prompted by his belief that Islam is \"an intolerant and violent religion.\"\nCharges laid against man after worshippers at Ontario mosque attacked with bear spray\nOn July 19, Omar pleaded guilty to three charges, including\u00a0administering a noxious substance with intent to endanger life or cause bodily harm;\u00a0assault with a weapon;\u00a0and mischief to religious property with motivation of bias, prejudice or hate based on religion.\nAs part of his plea, Omar agreed that the offences constituted terrorist activity under the Criminal Code, which allowed\u00a0the Crown to push for harsher sentences.\nHate motivation aggravating factor, judge says\nDurno\u00a0gave Omar an\u00a0eight-year sentence for the\u00a0assault with a weapon charge, and five-year\u00a0concurrent sentences for the other charges.\nHe said the offences were aggravated by the fact that they were motivated by hate, because they were planned and deliberated, and because they were conducted at a place of worship, among other reasons.\nOn the other hand, the sentence was mitigated by the fact that Omar\u00a0pleaded guilty, is a first-time offender, apologized to the court and has \"taken some steps to address the issues he faces.\"\nAfter credit for time already served, Omar will serve five years, three months and 15 days in prison.\u00a0He will become eligible for parole after half the sentence is served.\nIman Ibrahim Hindy of the Dar Al-Tawheed Islamic Centre in Mississauga spoke to reporters after Omar pleaded guilty last week.\n \n(Darek Zdzienicki/CBC)\nIbrahim Hindy, imam of the\u00a0Dar Al-Tawheed mosque, said no sentence is capable of reversing the fear, hurt and loss his community experienced as a result of the attack.\n\"There is a feeling of loss, a\u00a0feeling of loss of innocence, loss of safety, loss of sanctity that we have all felt since this attack,\" Hindy said\u00a0at a\u00a0news conference following the sentencing hearing.\n\"I do worry that this sentence does not serve as enough of a protection for our community and all Canadians who just wish to practice their faith in peace.\"\nVideo posted to social media shows attack\u00a0\nOn Monday, Hindy \nposted a video of the attack\n to\u00a0Twitter, allowing the public to see what happened for the first time.\n\"This is the moment the attacker came into Masjid Dar Al-Tawheed hoping to hurt worshippers who had their backs turned to him,\" Hindy said in the post.\nIn the video, a group of more than 20 men are seen standing in two rows inside a prayer room \u2014 most are praying with their heads down and eyes closed \u2014 when a man wearing a satchel and carrying a hatchet enters from the hallway behind them and begins spraying a yellow substance toward the front of the room.\nThis screenshot shows the moment the attacker entered the Mississauga mosque armed with bear spray and a hatchet.\n \n(Ibrahim Hindy/Twitter)\nThe attacker is then seen throwing\u00a0one of the spray cans to the ground and wielding\u00a0the hatchet as if about to strike.\nAs some of the worshippers turn around and realize what is happening, one rushes the attacker, who retreats to the back of the room and begins spraying a substance from a second can.\u00a0\nOther worshippers rush the attacker and successfully push him to the ground. As multiple men subdue him and drag him by his feet out of the room, others rush for the exit.\nAccused in Mississauga, Ont. mosque attack now facing terrorism proceedings\nWhile none of the worshippers were\u00a0seriously injured, one was kicked in the stomach and several suffered side effects from the bear spray, according to the statement of facts.\u00a0\n\"This is Islamophobia. Hatred so intense that it drives a young man to attack people he's never met before for no reason other than their faith,\" Hindy said in the post. \"I am deeply grateful for the bravery and courage of the brothers who stopped him and brought him down before he could cause the significant damage he intended to do.\"\n'Started to fantasize about committing actual harm'\nAt Tuesday's sentencing hearing, Durno went through the results of an independent psychiatric assessment of Omar\u00a0conducted by Hy Bloom, a licensed forensic psychiatrist, which has been viewed by CBC Toronto.\nOmar, who was born in Pakistan, told Bloom he considered himself a \"non-denominational Muslim,\" but that he had not been a believer in more than 10 years, the assessment said.\nOmar was \"unusually cooperative\" during the assessment, it added, providing Bloom with an explanation for his actions that centred on\u00a0his misgivings about\u00a0Islam.\u00a0\nThe assessment said Omar's parents suggested he tarted \"to internalize\" negative views about Islam when he was barely into adolescence.\nMan charged in death of Etobicoke mosque caretaker found not criminally responsible\n\"He became fixated on following media reports and internet stories ... bearing that subject matter, and started to fantasize about committing actual harm against seemingly high value symbolic targets of his religion of origin, culminating in the behaviours in question.\"\nBloom also found Omar had led a \"marginal life in relative isolation,\" characterized by struggles with academics, social life and mental health.\nBloom's final assessment \"strongly suggests\" a diagnosis of mild autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as a \"presumptive prenatal/intranatal neurodevelopmental problem.\"\u00a0\nDespite those findings, Durno found that Omar's \"moral culpability remains high.\"\nPair found guilty in beating of Mississauga father, family says act showed 'darkest side of humanity'",

        "content": "We've been having a blast this summer, trying out recipes submitted by kids and teenagers from across Alberta \non the Calgary Eyeopener.\n \n This week, after temperatures soared to 33 degrees on Monday, we made Lucia's brilliant pink lemonade slushy, made with sour cherries and blueberries!\n \n We also made a s'mores-inspired campfire log,\u00a0a summer twist on the holiday yule log, collaboratively dreamed up by a group of kids during an online cooking class.\nBookmark\u00a0\ncbc.ca/juliesrecipes\n\u00a0to keep up with all of Julie Van Rosendaal's dishes.\nHere are two versions of that rolled cake: one\u00a0made with a graham cracker-flavoured cake, chocolate ganache and toasted marshmallow filling, and another\u00a0with whatever jam or preserves you have, frosted with a coffee-infused buttercream.\nS'mores Campfire Log\nThe kids' brilliant idea to create a summer version of a holiday Yule log inspired this cake!\n \n I tried adding graham crumbs to the cake batter, but the flavour didn't come through. Instead, I swapped in some brown sugar and added some cinnamon for a graham cracker-like flavour.\n \n Inside, I spread some soft ganache and Swiss meringue, which I torched for a toasted marshmallow flavour! You can skip this part, or run it under the broiler for a minute or two to get a similar effect. (If you do this, you may have to let your cake sit for 10 minutes or so to make sure the fillings aren't too soft when you roll it up!)\n \n \nThis outdoor-inspired summertime treat was created by some creative kid minds. \n \n(Julie Van Rosendaal)\n It would also work to sprinkle the chocolate ganache with mini marshmallows and torch or broil them. (You may be able to use jarred Marshmallow Fluff, but I worry that it may be too stiff and hard to spread.)\n \n For the exterior, I used a soft ermine frosting, with a couple spoonfuls of cocoa to make it chocolate-ish, but not too dark. You could also cover yours with whipped cream, with a spoonful or two of cocoa added to make it light brown. And of course the candy \"fire\" is completely optional. Just make sure you have an adult around when you're making the caramel!\nCake\n5 large eggs\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/2 cup packed brown sugar\n1/4 cup water\n1 tsp vanilla\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1 tsp baking powder\n1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)\n1/4 tsp fine salt\nChocolate Ganache\n2 cups (about 12 oz) chopped chocolate or chocolate chips\n1 cup whipping cream or coconut milk\nSwiss Meringue\n3 egg whites (or the liquid drained from a can of chickpeas)\n3/4 cup sugar\nany chocolate frosting you like, or cream whipped with a spoonful of cocoa\nsugar, for making candy \"fire\" (about 1/2 cup)\nPreheat the oven to 375 \u030aF.\n \n In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar for about 2 minutes, until thick and pale yellow. (Use the whisk attachment of a stand mixer or whisk by hand.) Beat in the water and vanilla. Add the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt and stir until well blended.\n \n Line a shallow rimmed baking sheet (I use a half sheet pan that's about 12x18 inches) with parchment. Pour in the batter and spread it out to evenly fill the pan. Bake for 12-14 minutes, until golden and springy to the touch.\n \n Run a thin knife around the edge of the cake and invert onto a tea towel that's been dusted with icing sugar. Peel off the parchment, then starting on a short side, roll up the cake with the towel inside and set aside to cool.\n \n Meanwhile, make the ganache: Put the chocolate into a bowl, heat the cream to steaming and pour over the chocolate.\n \n Let sit for a few minutes, then whisk until smooth. (If a few bits of chocolate remain, you can gently heat the mixture in the microwave or on the stovetop.) Let cool so that it thickens but is still spreadable.\n \nLISTEN: Julie van Rosendaal on summer recipes created by\u00a0kids:\n \n \nCalgary Eyeopener\n7:03\nJulie van Rosendaal on the summer yule log\nOur food guide Julie Van Rosendaal with her take on a couple of recipes sent in by young people.\nTo make the marshmallow meringue, combine the egg whites and sugar in a wide glass or stainless steel bowl you can set over a pot of simmering water. Bring an inch or two of water to a simmer, place the bowl overtop and stir frequently until the mixture is very warm, turns more clear, and the sugar dissolves (you can feel whether or not it's still\n gritty by rubbing a bit between your fingers). Beat with an electric mixer for several minutes, until it thickens and forms stiff peaks.\n \n When you're ready to fill your cake, unroll it (it's OK if the end edge stays curled\u2014don't try to flatten it) and spread with the ganache, then the meringue, dropping it in large spoonfuls and lightly spreading it over the ganache.\n \n Torch the meringue with a blowtorch, or run it under the broiler (preheated to high) for a minute or two, just until it turns golden. (Or just leave it - it can be just marshmallow, untoasted!)\n \n If it seems very soft, let it sit for about 10 minutes to firm up before rolling it up. If your ganache is very soft, let the roll sit for a bit (cover with plastic wrap if you need to) to allow it to firm up.\n \n To turn your roll into a log, cut a piece about the size of a quarter of the log, cutting on a slight diagonal, then take that piece and place it along one side of the log, to look like a branch. Cover the whole thing with your choice of frosting (or chocolate whipped cream) and drag the tines of a fork lengthwise along it to make it look like bark.\n \n \nRECIPES\nRecipes with Julie Van Rosendaal: Viral recipes worth a try\nRECIPES\nRecipes with Julie Van Rosendaal: A few delicious ways to enjoy pickles\n \n To make the candy flames, heat about half a cup of sugar with a few tablespoons of water in a small-medium skillet. (I often add a few drops of lemon juice too, to prevent it from crystallizing.) You can stir it at first to make sure it's evenly combined, but stop once the sugar dissolves and it starts to bubble.\n \n Swirl the pan frequently to make sure it's caramelizing evenly, until the syrup thickens and turns golden.\u00a0It should be the\n colour of maple syrup. Pour onto a foil or parchment-lined baking sheet and tilt the sheet to make it spread fairly thin, then let it cool on the countertop.\n \n Once cooled, you can bash the piece of hard candy into shards and stick them upright in your frosted cake to look like flames!\nSummer Jam-Filled Campfire Log\nYou could, of course, fill this rolled cake with anything you like \u2013 lemon curd, a fruit compote, or even Nutella. If you have a smaller rimmed sheet, you can reduce the eggs to four\u00a0and the sugar and flour to 3/4 cup, and keep the rest the same.\nFrost your roll with any kind of frosting, like ermine, seven minute or buttercream\u2014for the show, I made a coffee-spiked buttercream with about 1/2 cup soft butter, 2-3 cups icing sugar, about 1\u00a0tablespoon\u00a0instant coffee dissolved in 1 tablespoon of water, and a few tablespoons of cream\u00a0\u2026\u00a0just enough to create a soft, spreadable frosting.\nCake\n5 large eggs\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 cup water\n1 tsp vanilla\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n1 tsp baking powder\n1/4 tsp fine salt\n1 to 1 1/2 cups jam, fruit preserves, lemon curd or your favourite filling\nCoffee Frosting\n1/2 cup butter, softened\n2-3 cups icing sugar\n1 Tbsp instant coffee or espresso, dissolved in 1 Tbsp water\n2-4 Tbsp milk, cream or water\n1/3-1/2 cup sugar, for the flames\nPreheat the oven to 350\u02daF.\n \n In a large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar for about 2 minutes, until thick and pale yellow. (I use the whisk attachment of my stand mixer, or whisk by hand.) Beat in the water and vanilla. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and beat (or whisk, or stir) until well blended.\n \n Line a shallow rimmed baking sheet with parchment. I use a half sheet pan that's about 12x18 inches. Pour in the batter and spread it out evenly to fill the pan to every edge.\nBake for 12-14 minutes, until golden and springy to the touch.\n \n Before the cake cools, lay a clean, smooth (not textured or terrycloth) tea towel on your countertop and dust it generously with icing sugar. Run a thin knife around the edge of the cake and invert it onto the towel.\u00a0\nPeel off the parchment, then starting on a short side, roll up the cake with the towel inside and let it sit on the counter until it's completely cool. Unroll the cake (it's OK if the inside edge stays curled\u2014don't try to flatten it) and spread with the filling.\u00a0\n \n \nThis rolled cake can be filled with anything you like \u2013 lemon curd, a fruit compote, or even Nutella. This particular one is filled with haskap jam. \n \n( Julie Van Rosendaal)\nRoll the cake back up and transfer to a board or serving platter. Cut off about 1/3 of it at a slight angle, and place the piece along the side of the roll, to make a branch.\nBeat the butter with the icing sugar, instant coffee mixture and enough milk, cream or water to make a soft, spreadable frosting, and spread all over the cake, sealing any gap between the main log and the branch. Smooth the frosting, then use a fork to make lines lengthwise down the log and branch, to make it look like bark.\n \n To make the candy flames, heat about half a cup of sugar with a few tablespoons of water (I often add a few drops of lemon juice too, to prevent it from crystallizing) in a small-medium skillet. You can stir it at first to make sure it's evenly combined, but stop once the sugar dissolves and it starts to bubble.\nSwirl the pan frequently to make sure it's caramelizing evenly, until the syrup thickens and turns golden - it should be the\n colour of maple syrup. Pour onto a foil or parchment-lined baking sheet and tilt the sheet to make it spread fairly thin, then let it cool on the countertop. Once cooled, break into shards and stick them upright in your frosted cake to look like flames!\n \n Serves about 8.\n \n \nThis cool and tangy summertime drink is made with sour cherries and blueberries.\n \n(Julie Van Rosendaal)\nTHE Pink Lemonade Slushy\nNine-year-old Lucia made what she calls THE pink lemonade slushy,\u00a0and it's pink because it's made with sour cherries!\u00a0\n \n Lucia says you can substitute any frozen fruit that has no seeds \u2014 frozen berries, peaches, plums \u2026delicious!\nIngredients\u00a0\n2 cups water\n2 cups ice\n1 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice\n2 tsp cranberry juice\n1 Tbsp Greek yogurt - optional\n2 1/2 cups frozen sour cherries\n1 3/4 cups frozen blueberries\n2 Tbsp maple syrup\n1 tsp cinnamon\nPut ingredients into the blender from the first on the list to the last, and blend on high.\n \n Enjoy!\u00a0",

        "content": "A group of Ontario firefighters is running a food drive for\u00a0unhoused asylum seekers in the Greater Toronto Area with the help of a grocery store chain.\nThe Allied Firefighters of Canada, a group of racialized firefighters, says it has teamed up\u00a0with Sobeys\u00a0Inc.\u00a0to put on\u00a0the\u00a0food drive\u00a0at a FreshCo grocery store located\u00a0at Bramalea City Centre, a shopping mall in Brampton.\nRandy Narine, an executive member of the Allied Firefighters of Canada and a Brampton firefighter, said the food drive, which started on Friday, will run for at least two\u00a0weeks. Customers have already paid for\u00a0more than 100\u00a0bags.\n\"Most of us were immigrants or refugees ourselves. I myself came here on refugee status many, many moons ago, so I know all too well what they're going through,\" Narine told CBC Toronto this week.\nCustomers can buy donation bags, filled with such items as food and personal hygiene products, for $5 or $10.\u00a0The firefighters, who are working with churches and shelters\u00a0to identify what the asylum seekers need, will then collect the bags and distribute them every Monday. The first load was taken to Revivaltime Tabernacle church in North\u00a0York.\nRandy Narine, an executive member of the Allied Firefighters of Canada and a Brampton firefighter, says: 'I myself came here on refugee status many, many moons ago, so I know all too well what they're going through.'\n \n(CBC)\nNarine said if the campaign works at the Bramalea\u00a0location, it will be rolled out to\u00a0other locations in the GTA. FreshCo is owned by Sobeys Inc. He said the campaign is the first of its kind for the group.\nRyan Agard, president of the Allied Firefighters of Canada and an acting district fire chief in Brampton, said the group hopes the asylum seekers feel support and love from the firefighters.\n\"We just want to show ourselves, first of all, as human beings, and then second of all, as people of different communities, saying that we all come together and we're all one and welcome to Canada. And this is from from us and from the beautiful citizens of Brampton,\" he said.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Peel Region said it is supporting more than 300 asylum seekers and families and the number grows daily. It said its shelter system is at 164 per cent occupancy. Historically, it said asylum seekers made up five to seven per cent of the shelter population but now they make up 40 per cent.\n\"While we cannot comment on specific numbers of asylum seekers currently staying at our emergency shelters, we are closely monitoring the situation and are pursuing innovative and sustainable long-term solutions to support refugees and Peel residents needing a safe place to stay,\" the region said in the statement.\nAgard unloads a donation bag for asylum seekers in Toronto on Tuesday.\n \n(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\nJason Richardson, manager of Freshco at Bramalea City Centre, said every bag has something different in it depending on what the asylum seekers need. Many include pasta sauce, pudding, canned vegetables and pasta.\u00a0\nOn its website, the Allied Firefighters of Canada says it strives to educate and to provide support to an \"all-inclusive\" group of people in fire services. Through ongoing education and political action, it says it \"strives to promote diversity, equality and a healthy network environment for firefighters of all under represented groups.\"\nHow Black-led groups quickly moved more than 200 asylum seekers off a Toronto street to shelter\nBlack-led coalition that opened doors to asylum seekers calls for more government help, donations\nNarine said the group works to support racialized\u00a0firefighters, to connect with ethnic communities, to educate fire services on how to connect better with their ethnic communities\u00a0and to break down barriers that prevent\u00a0racialized people\u00a0from becoming firefighters.\u00a0\nThe Freshco and Allied Firefighters of Canada donation bags are on display on a shelf in the Freshco at Bramalea City Centre.\n \n(CBC)",

        "content": "Analysts say a dramatic narrowing in the price discount for western Canadian heavy crude in the second quarter of 2023 should mean healthy profits for oilsands producers poised to start reporting their earnings later this week.\n\"It's been a nice tailwind for them,\" said Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick, adding senior oilsands producers like Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Suncor Energy Inc., and Imperial Oil Ltd. are best positioned to benefit from higher bitumen prices.\n\"They've had a weaker Canadian dollar too that has benefited them, so we're expecting good free cash flows.\"\nOilpatch reacts to phasing out of 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies\nGlobally, oil prices remained under pressure in the second quarter, with the benchmark West Texas Intermediate down three per cent from the first quarter of the year and benchmark Brent crude down five per cent.\nBut the difference between the price of Western Canada Select (WCS) \u2014 an oilsands bitumen blend \u2014 and New York-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) narrowed dramatically in the quarter to an average of US$15.07, versus US$24.77 in the first quarter, according to an RBC report.\nState of the oilpatch: Plentiful profits, pricey fuel, and a climate crisis\nIt's normal for a barrel of heavy, sour oilsands bitumen to sell for less than a barrel of higher-quality, light sweet product.\nBut there have been times in the past when that differential has been blown out, to the detriment of Canadian producers. For example, last fall, as the U.S. government's decision to release more oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve put downward pressure on prices, the WCS differential was trading for approximately US$32 per barrel less than WTI.\nGiant U.S. subsidies begin luring Canadian clean tech companies and talent to move south\nIn 2018, when a lack of pipeline capacity out of this country led to a glut of inventory, the WCS discount widened to as high as US$50 per barrel and took a bite out of the Canadian sector's profitability.\nSo far in the third quarter of 2023, the WCS discount has begun to widen again. But analysts say it should narrow once the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion comes into service early in 2024.\nThe Trans Mountain expansion will bring the pipeline's capacity up to 890,000 barrels per day and will provide producers with the option to diversify their oil exports globally. According to an RBC report, about 97 per cent of Canada's net oil exports went to the United States in 2022.\nCanada will soon have new rules for clean fuel. Here's what they'll cost when you fill up\nIn addition, a major new refinery is set to open later this year in Mexico \u2014 a development that will create another market for Canadian oilsands product and help to boost the price of WCS.\n\"We continue to believe the landscape favours heavy oil producers given the meaningful increases in refining capacity slated for 2023,\" said a recent Scotiabank report.\n\"We expect the WCS differential to continue to narrow beyond 2023.\"\nCanadian oil and gas companies begin reporting their second quarter earnings later this week, with oilsands companies MEG Energy Corp. and Cenovus Energy Inc. set to report Thursday and Imperial Oil Ltd. reporting Friday.",

CBC\u2019s Omar Dabaghi-Pacheco explores short-term and long-term solutions to the problem.\nOther clinics across Canada\nThe Marda Loop clinic is not the only such clinic providing membership programs, in Calgary or in Canada.\u00a0\nResearchers from Dalhousie University and Simon Fraser University\u00a0\nreleased a paper\n\u00a0in 2022 which tracked\u00a0the number of clinics taking private payment across the country.\nAt the time of the analysis\u00a0\u2014 between November 2019 and June 2020\u00a0\u2014 there were 14 private clinics in Alberta with a range of membership fees and private payment.\u00a0During that same period, there were 24 in Ontario and 30 in Quebec.\nA spokesperson in the federal health ministry said\u00a0other clinics in Calgary and Alberta charging membership fees\u00a0could also expect such a response in the future.\nCalgary clinic asks for nearly $5K a year for a 2-parent membership \u2014 and it's not the only one\nUnder the\u00a0\nCanada Health Act\n,\u00a0patients can't be charged for \"medically necessary\" services that are\u00a0provided in a hospital or by a doctor. If that happens, provinces that allow private health-care providers to do so will have\u00a0\ndollars\u00a0clawed back\n\u00a0by the federal government.\n\"It is not allowable that you would charge a patient as they come in to see a doctor for the care that you provide them,\"\u00a0Fiona Clement, a professor who specializes in health policy in the department of community health sciences at the University of Calgary, previously told CBC News.\u00a0\n\"But what is being tried, and I think kind of skirting the bounds of what's allowable,\u00a0are these membership fees.\"\nFiona Clement, a professor at the University of Calgary in the department of community health sciences, says the biggest impact of a clinic transitioning to a membership model would be felt by the individuals who wouldn't be equipped to afford it. \n \n(Riley Brandt/University of Calgary)\nHealth Canada said in its statement that where there is evidence of patient charges, mandatory deductions to federal health transfer payments to the province or territory must be taken.\nPrior to the Health Canada release on Tuesday, Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley said the decision made by the Marda Loop clinic \"undermines the very values of public healthcare.\"\n\"Public healthcare means every Albertan gets the care they need, when they need it and where they need it, regardless of the amount of money in their pocket,\" Notley wrote.\nCalgary clinic owner cites struggle to pay overhead\nReached at her clinic\u00a0Tuesday, Dr. Sally Talbot-Jones, owner and manager of the Marda Loop Medical Clinic, said it had taken her a year to reach the decision she did, citing struggles to meet overhead.\n\"We're empathetic people. We want to look after patients. But at the end of the day, the bank doesn't care that you're empathetic,\" she said. \"And patients were actually asking for options.\"\nTalbot-Jones said such an arrangement enabled her to be able to look after people who were looking to secure access to extra appointments.\nDr. Sally Talbot-Jones, owner of the Marda Loop Medical Clinic, said it's taken a year to make the decision to introduce a membership plan at her clinic.\n \n(Colin Hall/CBC)\nIn response to the statement from Health Canada, Talbot-Jones noted that there are many private clinics in Calgary \u2014 many of which may not be advertising.\n\"This is not the first time it's happened. I'm just, kind of, made this public at the wrong time, when people are upset,\" she said.\nTalbot-Jones said her clinic shouldn't be considered in contravention of the Canada Health Act, because a membership clinic offers more than just health-care to its clients.\n\"I am just helping those people that need the extra time,\" she said.\nDr. Alika Lafontaine, president of the Canadian Medical Association, said public health systems are deteriorating nationwide.\n \n(Marni Kagan/CMA)\nDr. Alika Lafontaine, president of the\u00a0Canadian Medical Association,\u00a0said that providing different levels of access to health services based on ability to pay can negatively impact patients who are in greatest need of care.\n\"We must also remember however that pay-out-of-pocket approaches become more prevalent as our public health systems deteriorate as we have seen nationwide,\" Lafontaine wrote in a statement.\u00a0\n\"Lack of investment, outdated incentives, and unhealthy working environments must be improved if we're to have providers remain committed [to] our public health systems and to ensure that delivery provides adequate access to needed health services.\"\nThe College of Family Physicians of Canada responded to the clinic's move \non social media\n.\n\"Charging patients for access goes against the principles of Canada Health Act, but is symptomatic of the pressures amid the crisis facing family doctors.

Lions in a Week 7 defensive battle\u00a0on Saturday.\u00a0\nThe Lions knocked off the Roughriders 19-9 as both teams committed a number of fouls and offensive miscues.\nThe B.C. Lions, 5-1,\u00a0are now on top of the West in the CFL,\u00a0but a chance to show off their high-flying offence was grounded by penalties and an injury to their starting quarterback on Saturday.\u00a0 The Riders are now third in the division.\u00a0\nB.C. starting quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. went off injured in the first quarter after Roughriders defensive end Pete Robertson found space around the outside to bring him down with an awkward tackle.\nAdams later tried to use the recumbent bike on the sideline to assess his fitness to return but immediately got off.\nBackup quarterback Dane Evans came in and led the Lions to a touchdown on an 84-yard first drive. It was his first touchdown of the season.\n\"You never want to see a leader of the team go down like that,\" he said. \"When you come into that situation, it's hard. I just try to make positive plays. Thankfully we strung together enough plays to get a win.\"\nLions head coach Rick Campbell said he didn't have a definitive timeline of how long Adams would be out for, adding he was waiting on an assessment first.\nDefensive battle\nNeither team dominated on offence with the Riders finishing with 283 yards, while the Lions had 231 as penalties and interceptions derailed many attempts to move the ball forward.\n\"It was a momentum killer. We were having great productive plays on first down and then we had to walk backwards. I don't want to say it was deflating but it sucks,\" said Evans. \"But when it mattered we put it together.\"\nCampbell agreed, saying it wasn't the prettiest of wins rather it was a \"grind it out\" style of win. In fact, it was the Lions first win at home against the Green and White in six games.\n\"Both defences were playing really well. We made some timely plays when they needed to be made,\" he said.\nB.C. Lions' Dominique Rhymes (19) fails to make the reception as he's hit by Saskatchewan Roughriders' Deontai Williams (24) during the first half of a CFL football game July 22.\n \n(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press )\nHe acknowledged the miscues on offence as well as the amount of penalties conceded \u2014\u00a0the Lions had seven penalties for 66 yards, while the Riders had six for 56 \u2014\u00a0but said he saw positives.\n\"My message to the team is I'm really proud of them. We've beaten every Western team. That's my message,\" Campbell said.\u00a0 \u00a0\nMason Fine's first start\nSaskatchewan's Mason Fine finished 32-for-41 with two interceptions in his first start of the season.\nMason Fine ready to seize opportunity and lead Roughriders\nRoughriders QB Trevor Harris to undergo surgery after tackle in loss to Stampeders\n\"I think there's a lot of plays he'd like to have back. I think it was fast for him,\" said Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson.\n\"It was a tough first game playing against arguably the best defence in league.\"\u00a0\nSaskatchewan Roughriders quarterback Mason Fine, back, loses his helmet as he's sacked by B.C. Lions' Woody Baron (58) and Boseko Lokombo (20) during the second half of a CFL football game in Vancouver on July 22.\n \n(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\nThat tag of \"best defence,\" is hard-earned says Lions cornerback Garry Peters. \"It's not something that just started. We've been building this for years,\" he said.\nThe Lions led 7-3 at halftime and took a 10-6 lead into the final quarter.\nSaskatchewan travels to Halifax, N.S., to take on the unbeaten Argonauts, 5-0, on July 29 in the Touchdown Atlantic game, while B.C. takes on the winless Elks, 0-7,\u00a0on the same day in Edmonton.",

        "content": "This is a First Person column by Syn Amanuel, who lives in Calgary. For more information about CBC's First Person stories,\u00a0\nsee the FAQ\n.\nDaybreak Alberta\n5:25\nFirst Person: Syn Amanuel\nTwo years after I arrived as a refugee in Canada, I returned to Africa to get married and to visit the rest of my family, who were refugees in Sudan.\nI was telling\u00a0everyone who asked that I hated Canada \u2014 the winter and how difficult life was \u2014\u00a0until one specific night, when my brother came to wake me in the courtyard at 3 a.m.\n\"Wake up, we need to get inside.\"\u00a0\n\"But I want to sleep outside where I can breathe freely.\"\n\"Not tonight, a sand\u00a0and dust storm is approaching.\"\nWe rushed into the one tiny room where my mother and two brothers were living.\nThe wind started to blow furiously outside in the small, dirt compound. Inside, we sat in darkness with the windows shut and without even electricity to power a fan. The sound of rain outside was just blowing sand. I felt like I was buried alive.\nFirst Person\nWhere am I from? Go ahead, ask. My history is as rich as the fabric of Canada\nYou have a story. We want to help you tell it. Join us at one of our free writing workshops\nWhen morning finally arrived, all I wanted was to pour water over my head, but that wasn't available either. And the thermometer read 50 C, the maximum it could register.\nMiserable, I sat under a tree in the compound.\nAnd in that moment, the strangest thing happened \u2014 I actually wished for what I hated most. Winter!\u00a0\nI longed for the snow of Canada\u00a0and finally realized that as difficult as things were for me in Canada, they were far better than what my family faced in Sudan.\nSyn Amanuel cuts potatoes outside the small room where her family stayed while they were refugees in Sudan.\n \n(Submitted by Syn Amanuel)\nI didn't know it then, but I've since learned there are specific stages that many refugees go through, similar to\u00a0the stages of grief. The first is a honeymoon phase, with a sense of relief and accomplishment for having made it to a safe country. Then reality kicks in with Stage 2, a stage of grief and hardship.\nWhen you are a refugee, you are a nobody. You've lost your identity. Everything that you once believed to be true and familiar is jeopardized and you're rebuilding a life from scratch.\nIn 2001, my sister and I fled persecution in Eritrea and were among the first Eritreans to arrive in Saint John. And although the local community was incredibly kind, they had little idea how to help us. We learned by trial and error. We literally had to open many cans and bottles to taste if it was close to what we were accustomed to eating. I have lasting scars from frostbite on my legs, from when I didn't understand how to protect myself.\u00a0\nI was working two full-time jobs to support myself and my family back home, and to repay the\n immigration loan\n for my air ticket. I worked overnight shifts as a health care aide. My colleagues assumed I would sleep during the day, but that's when I worked at Tim Hortons.\u00a0\n \nMy colleagues assumed I would sleep during the day, but that's when I worked at Tim Hortons.\n- Syn Amanuel\nI thought I knew basic English but I was lost when customers ordered a\u00a0\"double-double,\"\u00a0and the term\u00a0\"feeling blue\" seemed completely unrelated to emotions.\nI felt exhausted, overwhelmed. Only the support of my faith community\u00a0kept me going. My beliefs were the reason I left home, and meeting with my spiritual family three times a week brought me a sense of belonging in the midst of the pain.\nThe third stage in many refugee journeys is adaptation and acceptance. For those first two years, this seemed distant and unattainable. I wasn't even trying.\u00a0\nUntil the night that I experienced the sandstorm in Sudan.\nIt was my wake-up call, prompting me to reconsider my mindset. When I got back to Canada, life was still difficult but that spark of gratitude helped me transition into the recovery phase.\nIt took roughly six years, but I slowly grew comfortable with the new culture and surroundings. I moved to Hamilton, Ont., and took a one-year diploma course in medical administration, which opened the door to a better job.\nMy husband arrived and we moved to Calgary. Here, we were able to buy a house, and the city is so culturally diverse, I no longer feel like an outsider. I work in east Calgary, out of an office located amidst the many ethnic shops and restaurants of International Avenue.\nSyn Amanuel now feels settled and grateful to be in Calgary, where she lives with her husband Melaku and children Zema, left, and Amron.\n \n(Submitted by Syn Amanuel)\nPlus, the rest of my family was able to come. That took 10 years\u00a0but finally my brothers, sister\u00a0and parents all live together in the same city again.\nToday, I can look back and see those stages in my journey. I've seen these stages in the lives of other refugees as well. For 15 years, I've been first volunteering to help settle newly-arrived refugees and am now doing so in a professional capacity as a licensed immigration consultant. Many people get shocked by the scale of the challenges they still face.\u00a0\nI want to share my story to give them hope, to tell them they won't always feel like a refugee.\nI also wanted to thank those who sponsored and welcomed me. Since I was sponsored by the Canadian government, that means my gratitude is toward the whole Canadian society.\nCanada welcomed me with open arms 22 years ago, whether I was in a state of mind to appreciate it or not. And today I'm giving back to the community in my work and volunteer life; I didn't let you down.\nIt's been a long journey but now Canada is my home, even though\u00a0I still hate winter.\nTelling your story\nAs part of our ongoing partnership with the Calgary Public Library, CBC Calgary is running in-person writing workshops to support community members telling their own stories. Read more pieces from our\u00a0workshop\u00a0at the Village Square library in east Calgary.\nFirst Person\nMy grandma loved knitting.

If such extreme weather proves increasingly common in Central Canada, it poses an even greater risk, say experts, with some 18 million people living between Windsor and Quebec City.\nAaron Jaffe, an\u00a0NTP researcher who led the team on the ground in Tweed, warned against minimizing twisters classified only as EF-0 or EF-1.\n\"All it takes is a tree to fall into the house or cottage, and then you have significant damage,\" he said.\nBuilding resiliency\nPart of the work by the NTP seeks to build Canada's resiliency to tornadoes.\n\"If we know where they're happening with greater precision, we can come up with adaptation strategies that make a lot more sense,\"\u00a0said Greg Kopp, an\u00a0engineering professor at Western University.\nAn image of the EF-4-rated tornado damage at the farm on the west side of Highway 2A between Didsbury and Carstairs, Alta., on July 1. A woman took shelter in the home's basement and survived. \n \n(Northern Tornadoes Project)\nKopp said Canadian building codes need to be updated to reflect the growing risk posed by tornadoes,\u00a0and homebuilders should consider small investments to lessen the potential impact of a twister.\n\"Twenty years ago when we started talking about this, the only reaction we ever got was, 'You're crazy,'\" said Kopp, who acts as NTP's lead researcher.\nHe said simple additions to new builds, such as hurricane straps or roof clips, could help prevent major damage and only cost a few hundred dollars. The\u00a0small connectors\u00a0can keep roofs attached, even in the event of an EF-2 tornado, Kopp\u00a0added.",

        "content": "The byelection race to replace former Regina Coronation Park MLA Mark Docherty became\u00a0more interesting after recent comments by Docherty.\nIn February, Docherty resigned his seat to pursue other opportunities.\nLess than two weeks ago, Docherty appeared on a Saskatchewan politics podcast, The Skoop, and spoke\u00a0about the current state of politics in the province and his time as the representative of\u00a0Coronation Park.\nHe talked about being asked questions by his constituents.\n\"They said, 'What have you done for us? What's your legacy? What infrastructure has been put in place in regards to Coronation Park?\"' he said.\n\"And I looked and I went, oh my God, the answer is going to be nothing. I didn't know what to say and I had been advocating, lobbying,\" Docherty said.\nOn the topic of the Saskatchewan Party's \"growth that works for everyone\" slogan, Docherty\u00a0said, \"people are struggling.\"\n\"If I say that message to somebody, they kind of look at me dumbfounded. They don't understand. They're going, 'What have you done? What has this government done for us?\"'\nFormer Sask. Party MLA suggests government's approach not resonating with voters ahead of byelection\nThe podcast episode was released a day after Premier Scott Moe called the byelection.\nLast week, the Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA) commended Docherty\u00a0on Twitter.\u00a0\n\"SUMA thanks Mark Docherty for his integrity and conviction in speaking out. Mark has confirmed concerns SUMA has been raising about the continued struggles of homelessness, mental health, and addictions we see in our province, despite the economic surpluses we've seen,\" the tweets said.\nMark Docherty stepped aside in February, clearing the way for a byelection that was just called in July.\n \n(CBC)\nUniversity of Regina professor of politics and international studies Tom McIntosh called Docherty's comments \"sort of unprecedented\" in the history of the Saskatchewan Party.\n\"For someone like that to come out and say maybe we're not going in the right direction, maybe we're not representing our constituents the way we should. They have legitimate questions about what you've done for the riding.\"\nMcIntosh said former Premier Brad Wall and Premier Scott Moe have not experienced public criticism from within the party at the level of what Docherty said.\u00a0\n\"There's been a level of volatility in Alberta with cabinet people in and out, and fights inside the party, but we've seen none of that within the Sask. Party. Whatever is going on within the caucus, none of it is leaking out,\" McIntosh said.\n\"We've seen lots of people come and go, but none have had that kind of assessment of things on the way out.\"\nDocherty's comments have been used by NDP Leader Carla Beck to bolster her candidate's\u00a0campaign, saying the Saskatchewan Party and government slogan is not reality in the province. Beck and her Regina candidates have been repeating what Docherty said on the campaign trail.\n\"This was a gift to the NDP on the doorstep. The guy you liked, the guy you voted for, thinks things are going in the wrong direction,\" McIntosh said.\n\"It was an interesting thing\u00a0to see, especially given the timing.\"\n2 men who immigrated from Pakistan to Regina\u00a0among candidates\nNoor Burki\u00a0is the NDP candidate in Coronation Park and Riaz Ahmad is the Saskatchewan Party candidate. Both men won contested nominations.\nBurki\u00a0ran and lost in Coronation Park in 2020, but said he did not\u00a0lose his \"confidence and courage.\"\nBurki came to Canada from Pakistan in 2003. He owns\u00a0Wascana Driving School and teaches high school driver's education.\nHe said \"affordability\" as a top voter concern.\n\"People are living paycheck to paycheck. Some people say 'we can't go camping because we can't afford it anymore.'\"\u00a0\nBurki noted the comments by Docherty as well.\n\"Mark Docherty is a great person. I personally like him and\u00a0he was a great MLA and representative of the constituency. If he says Sask. Party\u00a0growth doesn't work for everyone, it doesn't work in my constituency.\"\nNDP Coronation Park candidate Noor Burki lost to the Sask. Party's Mark Docherty in the 2020 provincial election.\n \n(Adam Bent/CBC)\nAhmad came to Regina\u00a0in 2013 from Pakistan and operates a pest control business with his brother.\nAhmad said running for the party was \"an honour of a lifetime.\"\nHe commended the\u00a0Saskatchewan Party and its record of population growth, specifically internationally.\n\"It is due to the quite tremendous policies of the Sask. Party government that invites people from all around the globe.\"\nRiaz Ahmad is the candidate for the Saskatchewan Party in Regina Coronation Park.\n \n(Richard Agecoutay/CBC)\nAs of Sunday, Reid Hill of the Saskatchewan Progress Party was the only other candidate in the race. Parties have until Tuesday to register their candidates with Elections Saskatchewan.\nHill said in a news release he was motivated to run in part because of the health-care situation in the province.\n\"I saw first-hand the strains on\u00a0the system. The hospitals and care facilities are understaffed, and the lack of family doctors has shown just how bad our health system has become,\" Reid said.\nCoronation Park voting history\nThe NDP's Kim Trew was the MLA for Coronation Park from 1986 to 2011. Docherty took 53 per cent of the vote\u00a0in 2011, but saw that vote share drop\u00a0below\u00a050 per cent in the past two provincial elections.\nIn 2016, Docherty edged the NDP by 147 votes.\u00a0In 2020, Coronation Park was the fifth closest race in the province when\u00a0Docherty knocked off Burki by 283 votes. The Green Party received 191 votes and the Progressive Conservatives took 227 votes.\nSask. Party, NDP vie for attention, votes in Regina Walsh Acres",

She also called on Canadians to remember the role fossil fuels play in our economy and funding\u00a0our social safety net.\u00a0 \n\"What Canadians need to know about the energy sector in Canada is that it is a major source of investment and innovation, it is a major source of jobs and GDP, and that the world is still asking us for this energy,\" she said.\nOthers within the industry applauded the exemptions for projects that have Indigenous ownership or\u00a0reduce emissions.\n\"We're pleased to see the guidelines recognize the need for government partnership on projects essential to Canada's efforts to meet its climate commitments, including the Pathways Alliance's ambitious proposed carbon capture and storage project,\" said Kendall Dilling of\u00a0Pathways Alliance, an association of\u00a0oilsands companies.",

        "content": "Geraldine Shingoose was shocked when she opened a report probing what should be done to protect potential unmarked grave sites at former residential schools for Indigenous children.\nOf the thousands of former students who detailed the abuses they suffered to an adjudicator tasked with determining their eligibility for compensation under the historic Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, only about 30 have sought to have copies of their words archived.\nShingoose \u2014 an Indigenous elder and residential school survivor \u2014 is among that small group. She said she's heartbroken to think thousands of records will be destroyed within five years unless more survivors also request their preservation, an option she fears most are not even aware of.\n\"That's history,\" she said in a recent interview. \"Those are sacred stories.\"\nThe debate surrounding the future of these records has gained momentum since more First Nations began seeking answers about what happened to the children who died and disappeared from residential schools.\nElder Geraldine Shingoose is pictured in a 2021 file photo. Shingoose is one of thousands of people who detailed abuses suffered at residential schools. Only a few, such as Shingoose, have chosen to have their accounts archived.\n \n(Lenard Monkman/CBC)\nKimberly Murray says she began thinking of them after the Tk'emlups te Secwepemc Nation in British Columbia announced in May 2021 that ground-penetrating radar had detected what are believed to be 215 unmarked graves at the site of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School.\nThe finding shocked millions, despite residential school survivors having described such places for decades.\n\"I always thought there needs to be one last look at those records specific to the burials,\" said Murray, who previously worked as executive director of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, which spent five years investigating the residential school system.\nThe records in question are the product of what was known as the Independent Assessment Process, the protocol through which survivors had to access compensation for abuses they suffered as children.\nShingoose says she was shocked to learn that only about 30 residential school survivors have opted to archive records of the abuses they experienced.\n \n(Submitted by Geraldine Shingoose to The Canadian Press)\nIt was part of the settlement negotiated between the federal government, church entities and national Indigenous groups. Under the agreement, survivors could make claims about the sexual and physical abuses they endured at the government-funded, church-run institutions, as well as \"any other wrongful acts\" committed by former staff and other students.\nFrom the time the settlement was approved in 2007 until 2012, a little more than 38,000 claims were made, the majority of which were resolved through confidential closed-door hearings. In total, federal statistics show $3.1 billion was paid out.\nShingoose still recalls the questioning she received from the adjudicator and a representative from the federal government into details of the physical and sexual abuse she suffered at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School in Saskatchewan, which she attended for nine years.\nShe left the experience retraumatized, she said, describing it as a \"really, really terrible process.\"\nWhat should happen to records?\nBy 2014, the question of what should happen to those transcripts and supporting documents landed at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.\nOn one side, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation \u2014 the archive established to house its records \u2014 along with the federal government, said they ought to be preserved. The chief adjudicator of the compensation process and 24 Catholic Church entities argued they should be destroyed.\nThe Assembly of First Nations supported the latter position. Phil Fontaine, the former chief of the advocacy organization who helped negotiate the settlement, submitted an affidavit outlining his desire to see the records destroyed unless a survivor agreed to have them archived.\nIndigenous residential school records can be destroyed, Supreme Court rules\nNew website helps residential school survivors preserve or destroy records\nHe used his own story as an example. While a regional chief in Manitoba in 1990, Fontaine became one of the first leaders to speak publicly about the sexual abuse he suffered at the former Fort Alexander Indian Residential School \u2014 but in all the times doing so, he never divulged specifics.\n\"This is because I consider my story to be private,\" his affidavit read.\nWhile negotiating the settlement, he said he raised the need for the names of children who abused other children never to be revealed due to the harm it would inflict on Indigenous communities.\nIn the end, according to Fontaine's affidavit, it was agreed the names of perpetrators would never be released and only survivors could access their own records.\nShingoose says the transcript of her hearing runs 278-pages long and blacks out the names from her Catholic-run school, which she and others have likened to \"protecting the abuser.\"\nIn the initial court case, the 24 Catholic entities argued those confidentiality provisions were the reason they waived the rights otherwise afforded in a court to mount a defence and challenge a survivor's account.\nThe Ontario Superior Court of Justice ultimately ordered the records to be destroyed after giving survivors 15 years to seek copies of their own files. The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which upheld the order to see them destroyed by September 2027.\nIn its 2017 ruling, the top court concluded promising the utmost confidentiality for both complainants and perpetrators was \"inescapable\" in order for the compensation process to work.\nPerry Bellegarde, then the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, welcomed the ruling as \"good and fair\" at the time.\nRecords should be re-examined, advocate says\nBut one area neither the courts nor compensation process considered was the deaths and disappearances of children, says Murray, who now serves as an independent adviser to Ottawa on how to help Indigenous communities search for unmarked graves and retrieve records.\n\"What would they have said if there was information about potential murders and deaths and burials, if that information was shared with the court?\" said Murray, a member of the Kahnesatake Mohawk Nation.\n\"What would they have said about that?\"\nMurray says survivors talk about witnessing deaths and helping dig graves, and believes the abuse records ought to be re-examined to see if they contain details such as the name of children who died. She made the call in a progress report released last month, the same one read by Shingoose that raised concern about the lack of records being archived.\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller looks on as chair of the Residential School Documents Advisory Committee Cadmus Delorme speaks during a news conference in Ottawa last month. \n \n(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller is overseeing Ottawa's efforts to archive additional residential school records. A spokeswoman says the minister is open to finding solutions, but underlined that Ottawa must respect the \"absolute confidentiality\" of the documents, as ordered by the courts.\nCadmus Delorme to chair federal committee identifying and sharing historic residential school documents\nThe National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation says it supports Murray's call to re-examine the records and believes such a process could unfold in such a way that ensures privacy.\nIt currently reports having 27 packages of records survivors have decided to share.\n\"We understand that sharing may be difficult and traumatic,\u00a0so at no point do we canvass or ask for their\u00a0records,\" it said in a statement.\n\"While we hope survivors continue to place their trust in us, it is ultimately a personal decision.\"\nMurray pins the fact such a small number of survivors have chosen to share their records on a lack of awareness that they can do so, and questions why such information is not more widely circulated.\n\"It is the worst notice program I've ever seen.\"\nShingoose applied for her records in 2019. She provided a copy to the national archive and kept one for herself so her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren could see, she said.\nSurvivor let down by Winnipeg archbishop's response to residential school calls for action\nBlog\nHow Idle No More changed Indigenous elder's life\nIt is a way of ensuring the most detailed account of her experience as a residential school survivor is not forgotten.\n\"I wanted to share my truth,\" said Shingoose. \"I want my story to be shared.\"",

        "content": "As extreme heat hits many parts of the world amid a warming climate, \nmillions of people are turning to air conditioners for relief\n.\nResearch shows that household air conditioning is one of the \"most effective adaptation strategies to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity,\" \nsays a Statistics Canada report released this week\n. That's particularly the case for \nolder adults and vulnerable populations\n such as those with mental illness.\nBut researchers who study climate adaptation say it can also be an unsustainable and problematic solution to extreme heat.\nAnabela Bonada, manager and research associate at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo, said\u00a0air conditioning is \"absolutely necessary\" for vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes.\nBut, she said, it's a short-term solution and should be \"the last resort \u2014 because it leads to more heat, which is what we're trying to avoid.\"\nThe problems with air conditioning\nA study published in The Lancet in 2021\n, led by Ollie Jay, a professor of heat and health at the University of Sydney in Australia,\u00a0described air conditioning as a \"widespread but unsustainable cooling solution.\"\n\"It's unsustainable if we want to air condition everybody,\" Jennifer Vanos, associate professor in the School of Sustainability\u00a0at Arizona State University and one of the study's co-authors, said in an interview with CBC News.\nThe study cited a number of reasons for that.\nDo you live in a heat island? See how your neighbourhood compares\nIt heats\u00a0up cities and the Earth in a few different ways.\n Firstly, air conditioners are heat pumps that move heat from the inside to the outside of a building. Bonada said that means heat from thousands of homes \"is being pumped back out into the city, which is \nalready hotter than surrounding areas\n.\"\nMany air conditioners contain refrigerants called HFCs or hydrofluorocarbons, which can cause far more global warming per kilogram than carbon dioxide.\nHowever, most of their global warming impact comes from the amount of electricity they use in places with fossil fuel-powered generation. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), indirect emissions from space cooling \nhave tripled between 1990 and 2021 to more than a gigatonne\n.\nA technician works on an air-conditioning unit in Houston on June 26, 2023. Many air conditioners contain hydrofluorocarbons, which can cause far more global warming per kilogram than carbon dioxide. But most of their impact comes from the amount of electricity they use in places with fossil fuel-powered generation. \n \n(Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle/The Associated Press)\nIt's not very\u00a0accessible to those who need it most.\n\u00a0The cost of buying and running air conditioners tends to make them unaffordable to the most vulnerable.\nThe\u00a0\nStatistics Canada study this week\n said that while air conditioners were in 61.1 per cent of Canadian homes in 2017, people were far less likely to have them if they had less than a high school education, lived alone\u00a0or did not own their own homes.\nThe Lancet study found even bigger disparities in countries like China, especially among those older than 65 and living in rural areas.\nAir conditioning also doesn't work outdoors, where people are often at higher risk of heat-related illness and death.\nWATCH |\u00a0The biggest risk during B.C.'s deadly heat dome is poverty:\u00a0\nThe biggest risk during B.C.'s deadly heat dome: Poverty\n26 days ago\nDuration \n2:07\nA new report says that a disproportionate number of financially vulnerable people died in British Columbia during the punishing 2021 heat dome event. Many who died had no air conditioning.\nIt can strain the grid, leading to deadly blackouts during extreme heat. \nThe lead author of\u00a0a\u00a0\n2021 study published in the journal Environmental Science &\u00a0Technology\u00a0\nsuggested that \"a widespread blackout during an intense heat wave may be the deadliest climate-related event we can imagine\" and an \"increasingly likely\" scenario.\nAir conditioners can use a lot of power, and when that\u00a0power demand exceeds the capacity of the grid, it\u00a0has already led to deadly outages, such as in Pakistan in 2015 and 2018, the Lancet study noted.\nIn Canada, that's happened on a small scale \u2014\u00a0with increased air conditioning use being\u00a0\nblamed for a hydro outage in Ottawa's west end last month\n.\nAnd in British Columbia, \nsome landlords have recently warned tenants\n against installing air conditioners, saying older buildings don't have the electrical capacity to handle them.\nWATCH | Tenants in B.C. warned by some landlords not to\u00a0install\u00a0AC units:\u00a0\nB.C. landlords warn renters against installing AC units in mid-summer\n5 days ago\nDuration \n2:27\nB.C. renters are getting letters from landlords saying they cannot install air conditioners in their units, and warning they'd be responsible for any damage they might cause. One renter says he's seen the temperature in his apartment as high as 38 C \u2014 well beyond what is considered safe for long periods.\nThe Intact Centre's Bonada said the problem isn't just in B.C., and isn't limited to individual buildings.\u00a0\"Our entire infrastructure needs to be updated.

B.C. recommends keeping them closed between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., and then using fans to help move air, including kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans.\n \n \nInstalling \nthermal curtains or window coverings\n, and keep them closed during the day. Vanos said that\u00a0in Arizona, many people also have heat-blocking window coatings that are transparent.\n \nThey both recommend \nsleeping in the coolest room in your house\n, such as the basement, during heat waves.

        "content": "It's an area of farmland Ryan Maurer says is worth as much as a Lamborghini.\nHigh run-off flooded one of his fields in spring 2022, leaving shallow pools of water. This was before the farmer opened ditches to drain it.\n\"Would you take your Lamborghini and park it in a slough?\"\u00a0Maurer asked on his farm near Grenfell, Sask., about 125 kilometres east of Regina.\nNo, he says, he wouldn't.\n\"But society's asking us to do that,\" Maurer added. \"And then they turn around and tell us to grow more food.\"\nMaurer's land is part of a drainage network known as the Tetlock Conservation and Development Area Authority. Farmers\u00a0there work together to move water through each other's land and out into a creek.\nThe farmers in the Tetlock network say the water is moved in a managed and slower pace when it's released, helping mitigate potential flooding downstream. There are control gates, smaller culverts, tile piping and holding ponds.\nRyan Maurer gestures to his barley field near Grenfell, Sask., Friday, July 7, 2023. \n \n(The Canadian Press/ Michael Bell)\nIn fact, the Tetlock normally only adds 0.5 per cent of water to the flow of the creek, according to data provided by the farmers who oversee the network.\n\"It's not as dramatic as everybody says it is,\" said Owen Pekrul, a farmer who's also part of the drainage network. \"Because it's a ditch or it's organized, they think it affects a lot of things.\"\nBut for some, drainage is a problem.\nFarmers downstream of some other networks say huge gushes of water continue to wash out their fields each year.\nEnvironmental groups also worry about the loss of wetlands, as some are drained to make way for more arable acres.\nThey say this puts habitats at risk and causes water quality to degrade.\nSaskatchewan landowners say illegal drainage is washing out land, roads downstream\nAdvocates call on Sask. government to create wetland policy before agricultural water policy\nRural municipalities have raised concerns about illegal works causing water to breach grid roads.\nRural officials have asked the Water Security Agency, which is in charge of overseeing drainage, to ensure illegal drainers get permits.\n\"The biggest concern that we have is that many ratepayers just are not following the rules that are in place, the laws if you will,\" said Helen Meekins, a councillor with the Rural Municipality of Pleasantdale in southeast Saskatchewan.\n\"The rural municipality isn't against drainage,\" Meekins added. \"But, if they go through the permit process, then at least we know where there's going to be more water and how it's going to affect the infrastructure that we have in place.\"\nSome farmers say managed networks, such as the Tetlock, could help address flooding issues as long as everyone upstream and downstream can work together.\nRyan Maurer holds barnyard grass in his barley field near Grenfell, Sask., Friday, July 7, 2023. Barley was the intended crop, but a low wet spot in the field allowed the barnyard grass to thrive, lowering the field\u2019s yield. \n \n(The Canadian Press/ Michael Bell)\nMaurer, as well as others involved in the network, are members of the Saskatchewan Farm Stewardship Association, a group that has lobbied the province for managed drainage to promote soil health and crop production.\nHe said drainage helps him turn soil that's too salty into something that can grow healthy crops.\nIt also allows him to be more productive with his time on the field. That's because those working the machines don't have to move around various sloughs when they apply fertilizer and spray chemicals.\n\"These little sloughs are a couple inches of water. There's nothing major,\" Maurer said. \"So, we over-apply. How do we get around that? Well, drainage and management is the answer.\"\nNot all drainage has been done in a managed way in Saskatchewan.\nFor decades, producers have dug ditches to move water out without approval from the Water Security Agency.\nIn 2018, Saskatchewan's auditor estimated there were up to 9,712 square kilometres of land with unapproved works.\nThe agency has said it's brought many unpermitted works into compliance by working with landowners and making sure the stream, pond or lake can handle the amount of water flowing in.\nResearch projects have also been looking into best practices. In one, a farmer has been draining water from various sloughs into one larger consolidation pond.\nCandace Mitschke, the executive director with the Saskatchewan Farm Stewardship Association, said different solutions are required for each farm because landscapes across the province aren't the same.\nBut, she said, issues can be resolved when people work together.\nProducers Owen Pekrul, left, and Ryan Maurer, right, during a visit to drainage ditches that go through their land near Grenfell, Sask., Friday, July 7, 2023. The ditches are managed by members of the Tetlock Conservation and Development Association.\n \n(The Canadian Press/ Michael Bell)\nIn rare cases, farmers have expropriated downstream land so they can get a permit and manage the water appropriately.\n\"Sometimes you're not going to get people to co-operate no matter what you do. In those cases, that's when expropriation is that important piece and enables that network to function,\" Mitschke said.\nThe Water Security Agency still has a ways to go to bring all unapproved works into compliance.\nSince 2017, only about a third of land with unpermitted works, about 3,146 square kilometres, has been brought into compliance.\nSaskatchewan's auditor has recommended unpermitted drainage be addressed quickly. The longer people wait, it noted, the more frustrated they become.\nThe auditor has also recommended the agency establish a wetlands policy to ensure water quality doesn't degrade, which the agency says it's working on.\nFor Maurer, it's all about water management. He again pointed to the Tetlock network as an example of good practices.\n\"If everybody did that, it would be managed going in,\" he said. \"Just by saying, 'Quit draining water,' it doesn't help anybody. It creates the problem.\"",

Money for some services and programs has been halted and elders who usually receive assistance are in a tough spot. CBC's Louise BigEagle explains.\nOn Thursday in an emailed statement to CBC News, Indigenous Services Canada confirmed the band's internal governance dispute was impacting its ability to meet the requirements to access its money.\n\"It is important to note that funding related to the funding agreement between Carry the Kettle First Nation and Indigenous Services Canada has not been halted or reduced,\" the ISC statement said.\u00a0 \n\"No programs or services provided by Indigenous Services Canada have been impacted.\"\nIn a correspondence between ISC and Carry the Kettle reviewed by CBC News, the department said it was unable to process band council resolutions it received from Carry the Kettle, as those documents included signatures by people who were not duly elected members of council.\nEashappie declined multiple requests for comment about this story.\nImpacts felt immediately\nEashappie's announcement caught people in the community by surprise.\nRena Ryder's granddaughter Stacey Hotomani said elders like her grandmother, who is living on a fixed income, weren't told they'd be affected by this before Eashappie published his statement.\nHotomani said she was shocked that\u00a0funding to help elders like Ryder\u00a0was cut on such short notice, because elders in Carry The Kettle are always helped first.\n\"Power bills out here run from $900 to $1,500 per month. [Her] pension is $2,000 a month,\" Hotomani told CBC News on behalf of Ryder.\n\"That has to carry them until the next pension day, which is 28 to 30 days away. When they're paying for a power bill now, they're only going to have limited cash to spend on their groceries and their needs, which is sad.\"\nShe said the existing arrangement, where the First Nation paid those bills,\u00a0was put in place long ago and has never been disrupted until this recent development.\nHotomani said she and her aunties will try to\u00a0help Ryder cover bills and expenses when they can, because they don't want the 89-year-old residential school survivor to have to worry.\nStacey Hotomani, right, says she has been in contact with Carry The Kettle's chief to seek answers for if her grandmother Rena Ryder, left, would have her utility bills paid.\n \n(Kirk Fraser/CBC News)\nHotomani said she wants\u00a0the chief and council to reinstate the payments to elders. She said she texted\u00a0Eashappie to get answers, but hadn't gotten any responses.\n\"We're just hoping something good comes out in the end. We're hoping the chief and council can sit together and plan something for these elders,\" Hotomani said.\nAn election dispute\u00a0\nIn 2018, Carry the Kettle gained sovereignty for its own elections through a Custom Election Act. This means the Indian Act election rules set out by ISC\u00a0no longer apply there.\nThe First Nation said its custom\u00a0election act aligns with the traditional customs and election process of Nakoda values and governance.\u00a0\nWhile matters are still being settled in court \u2014 the band is slated to appear in court this week to face the contempt of court charges \u2014 Haywahe, one of the two councillors that Carry the Kettle had replaced in the byelection,\u00a0told CBC News she continues to work as a councillor.\nShe said the removal of the pair of councillors\u00a0was backlash for them digging into band financials and finding funds she believes were unaccounted for.\nEashappie\u00a0didn't answer\u00a0an interview request seeking clarity on the councillors' allegations.\nCarry The Kettle is dealing with an internal governance dispute which has led to its funding being cut off.\n \n(Kirk Fraser/CBC News)\nHaywahe said\u00a0she has hope things will be fixed with the overall court case.\n\"I have faith that because we're federal Crown wards that the federal court here will address this properly. It is a breach,\" she said.\n\"I'm pretty sure that our band members will get the answers that they need, because that transparency and accountability is missing in our band and we really had no choice but to do this.\"\nHaywahe said\u00a0she suggested mediation between the two councillors and the band, and waited two months for the process to begin, but it never happened.\nFunding cuts 'preventable'\nBellegarde, the other removed council member, said she too was disappointed things weren't worked out internally before ISC took funds out of band control.\n\"The funding cuts were definitely preventable. We could've come to the table and resolved everything,\" she told CBC News on Thursday.\u00a0\n\"It's too bad it happened that way. Mediation was there, it's still there, but there has been no unanimous agreement to come to the table.\"\nBellgarde said\u00a0she's never seen anything like this matter and it's leaving the community in disarray.\n\"We're in such a tough spot because self-determination, if we have enough self determination, self government can happen,\" she says.\n\"If culture is so important to us, we can make it happen \u2014 but we're so dependent on money.\"\nIndependent appeal body needed: treaty governance prof\nThe matter in Carry the Kettle highlights the need for an independent appeal body\u00a0designed to look at electoral disputes, according to Kathy Walker, an assistant professor in political studies at the University of Saskatchewan.\n\"They could have a fair and impartial hearing that is more in keeping with actual Indigenous traditional governance, or based on the customs of the community that has the dispute,\" Walker, who teaches courses on Indigenous governance.\nEashappie's post on social media on July 12 indicated Bellegarde and Haywahe were trying to seek third-party management for the band. Both councillors told CBC they did not directly seek\u00a0out third-party management on behalf of the band, but asked ISC what their options were and whether or not that included third-party management.\nISC's statement to CBC News said the band was not currently under third-party management.\u00a0\nTerrina Bellegarde says she is still acting as councillor because the federal government ruled she is to stay in her position until the band can come to an agreement.\n \n(Kirk Fraser/CBC News)\nWalker said third-party management, which involves a band handing complete financial management to an outside party while it works to address mismanagement-related problems, is a rare move\u00a0and would be \"a big thing.\"\n\"It's a pretty drastic measure, to my understanding it's not exercised lightly or very often today,\" Walker said.\nShe said\u00a0she hopes this experience will be a learning experience for self-governing First Nations, or those who wish to implement their own custom elections acts in the future.\n\"What's really the underlying problem behind a dispute like that is the Indian Act and the measures we're taking to get away from it,\" she said.\n\"Will there be bumps in the road to get away from it? Definitely. But we need to keep moving in that direction.\"",

So I brought her to Yorkton, where I thought it would be quiet ... a nice quiet place for her to live,\" said Bigknife.\nBut that did not stop some of her children, including\u00a0Tuckanow, from getting into\u00a0trouble.\u00a0\n\"Anywhere you go ... it's there.\u00a0That alcohol and drugs is there, so it doesn't matter where you think you're taking your kids to be in a safe place.\"\nAs the years went by, Tuckanow developed a serious drug dependency.

She got turned down for welfare services and had difficulty with the long processes involved with\u00a0getting housing.\u00a0\n\"I tried everything that I could to\u00a0help her, to love her, to try and keep her home,\" said Bigknife.\u00a0 \n\"But you know what? When I try to reach out to the people, reach out to the\u00a0places ... I couldn't get anywhere with it. I\u00a0felt so helpless.\u00a0Because\u00a0what am I going to do with my girl? What am I going to do for my girl?\"\nBigknife said that for the nearly two weeks Tuckanow was at the city hall tent encampment with friends, she would go across the street to the YWCA most\u00a0mornings to\u00a0try to get shelter. Bigknife said her daughter never mentioned talking to a member from social services about housing while in the encampment.\n\"I can see why people stay in that kind of life.

Retail prices have \nreportedly\n\u00a0increased by 11.5 per cent in the past year. Just in the past month, prices shot up three\u00a0per cent after delayed but significant monsoon rains\u00a0caused substantial damage to crops.\nAs per Statistics Canada, since January, Canada \nimported\n\u00a0$45 million\u00a0worth of long grain or basmati rice from India. But the ban is on small- and medium-grain or non-basmati rice, which accounted for almost $3 million in imports.\n\"All the non-basmati rice seem to be banned for six\u00a0to eight\u00a0months.

The government of India has banned the export of non-basmati white rice, in an effort to make rice more available and affordable in that country. As CBC's Pratyush Dayal reports, some rice lovers here are getting nervous.\nIn Regina, panic buying was evident at Foodomix, which supplies Indian groceries. Sam Pat, the owner, said people have been grabbing multiple bags. Now, the store has\u00a0limited it to one bag per family.\n\"In South Asian communities, rice is one of the staple diets. This might inflate the prices with increased demand,\" Pat said.\n\"The panic is right now as we don't know how long the ban will last. Vendors are not giving us any timelines. The panic is because there is no clear communication on how long it would take to have the proper flow in the market.\"\nShafeeq Meer, owner of the Biryani Box in Saskatoon, predicts India's export ban on non-basmati rice will eventually cause the cost of basmati rice to shoot up, due to increased demand.\n \n(Pratyush Dayal/CBC)\nShafeeq Meer, owner of the Biryani Box in Saskatoon, said inflation was already causing enough stress.\n\"Now, with this new move, the other people will start consuming basmati rice and we make biryani with basmati rice. It's going to affect our business a lot,\" he said.\n\"Ninety\u00a0per cent of our business is with rice and we are thinking about what we should do. Should we raise prices? How will it impact our customers?\" he said.\nWith uncertainty lingering around supply, Meer said he and other small business owners are concerned about the next steps.\n\"It's definitely going to take our sleep from nights.\"",

In his new book The Heat Will Kill You First: Life and Death on a Scorched Planet, Goodell strips down the facts and consequences of extreme heat and offers a roadmap for our future as we face ever-climbing temperatures.\nPrebble said he expects this will force\u00a0Canada's\u00a0oil and gas companies to\u00a0finance themselves more in order to cover for the deficit in subsidies from the federal government.\u00a0\nHe also believes the federal government's decision reflects the reality of a\u00a0Canada grappling with the effects of climate change.\u00a0\n\"You know we're entering a time now, as we see from the wildfire situation across Canada this summer, that climate change is becoming a\u00a0really urgent issue to address and that means that fossil fuel production has to be cut back in a really significant way,\" Prebble said.\u00a0\nReiter's statement did not indicate\u00a0whether the province\u00a0will follow the federal government's lead and slash\u00a0provincially provided subsidies, but Prebble said\u00a0he believes that to be unlikely.\u00a0\nCanada will soon end 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies. But what does that mean?\nMore than 2,000 wild species face a high risk of being wiped out in Canada, report warns\nIn a statement, Lisa Baiton, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said the organization is \"generally aligned\" with the framework released by the federal government Monday.\u00a0\n\"We are pleased to see the recognition that partnering with industry to invest in technologies to help decarbonize Canada's economy remains an important part of reaching the government's climate change and energy priorities as well as support for Indigenous participation in resource projects,\" Baiton wrote.\u00a0",

        "content": "Fewer people in Regina died from overdoses in June than any other month so far this year, police data shows, but the city is still on pace for the deadliest year on record.\nSix people died from overdoses last month, according to monthly overdose numbers issued by the Regina Police Service.\nA total of 72 people have died from overdoses in Regina as of June 30 \u2014 the most reported by police through the first half of a year since at least 2018, data shows.\n\"It's a tragedy,\" acting police chief Lorilee Davies told reporters, during a break in Tuesday's meeting of police commissioners.\n\"Anytime anyone loses their life in the community, it's a huge loss for our city.\"\nTwo in three of the people who have died this year are men, which is on par with past years, data shows.\nPolice-reported overdoses hovered around the same level from January through April, but climbed significantly in May and increased again in June, data shows.\nIn June, police reported about 330 overdoses, data shows. Officers only attended 24 of those incidents, the fewest so far this year.\nRegina needs more services to help with addictions, Davies said, and the onus to access those services has to shift from the individual to the providers.\n\"We have to take the services to people in the community. We can't expect the community just to walk into a hospital and say, 'I'm here. Help me get sober,'\" Davies said.\n\"We really have to reimagine how we map out those services in the community.\"\nRobberies, assaults are up: data\nMore people are being robbed and assaulted compared to last year, data shows.\nPolice reported nearly 160 robberies through June \u2014 almost a third of which were reported last month, data shows.\nRegina police reported 118 robberies through the first half of 2022.\nDavies told reporters that the rise in robberies reflects the dysfunction in the city that may stem from larger social issues going unaddressed, such as homelessness and addiction.\n\"There is no tie that I could make [that] homelessness or addictions leads to robberies, but it is a statistic in our community,\" she said.\nDuring Tuesday's board meeting, Davies told members that about 30 per cent of robberies reported last year involved the use of a weapon, whereas there have been none so far this year.\nData shows almost half of this year's robberies happened on the street. Davies said during the meeting that the robberies have often occurred at night\u00a0and the assailant used physical force.\nThe number of assaults has risen significantly as well.\nPolice have reported nearly 1,200 assaults in\u00a0the first half of the year, up from 915 total assaults at the same point last year.\nMore than two in five assaults reported this year were deemed Level 2 assaults, defined by police as assaults with a weapon or those that cause bodily harm.\nPolice reported nearly 500 Level 2 assaults so far this year, about a quarter of which were reported last month, data shows.\nDavies believes domestic violence may play a role in the increase, she said.\nSaskatchewan has had the highest rate of police-reported intimate partner violence of any province for years, \nStatistics Canada data shows\n.\nThe Regina Police Service received roughly 3,300 calls about domestic conflict \u2014 which include violent and non-violent calls \u2014 through the first half of the year, including 579 calls in June, data shows.\nThe federal government announced Tuesday that Saskatchewan will get more than \n$20 million over four years\n to address gender-based violence\u00a0through a\u00a0national action plan.\u00a0",

        "summary": "India's decision to ban the export of non-basmati rice has led to consumers panic-buying and stockpiling Indian rice around the world, driving up prices in the process.",
        "content": "India's decision to ban the export of non-basmati rice has led to consumers panic-buying and stockpiling Indian rice around the world, driving up prices in the process.\nIn Canada, the U.S. and abroad, reports of panic-buying are flourishing on social media, with stores that cater to South Asian communities implementing caps on the amount that any customer can buy, and adjusting prices.\nSriram Ramamurthy, the manager of Iqbal Halal Foods in Toronto, told CBC News in an interview Monday that he saw an immediate\u00a0increase in demand for rice once word of the ban spread on Thursday of last week.\n\"They started coming in here and\u00a0they wanted to buy more and more,\" he said. He soon implemented a limit of one bag per customer, but that quickly proved futile as customers would come back with more family members, \"each one trying to pick two or three at a time.\"\nSome customers would even approach other customers in line who were not buying rice, trying to get them to purchase it on their behalf, he said.\nWATCH | Why some in Saskatchewan are buying up rice:\u00a0\nWhy some people in Saskatchewan are snapping up rice\n10 hours ago\nDuration \n2:16\nSome people in Saskatchewan are snapping up rice before it runs out. The government of India has banned the export of non-basmati white rice, in an effort to make rice more available and affordable in that country. As CBC's Pratyush Dayal reports, some rice lovers here are getting nervous.\nRamamurthy\u00a0says he carries more than 40 different brands of rice in his store, mostly from India, but the majority of what he sells is basmati rice, a premium grade of rice that isn't even included in the export ban.\nBut that hasn't stopped customers from trying to buy up every grain they can, of basmati and varieties included\u00a0in the ban, just in case, he said.\nIndia's export ban on non-basmati rice triggers panic buying at Sask. grocery stores\nSiraj Mohammed said he heard about the ban, so decided to come \"down to the grocery store expecting that this is not gonna be the case in Canada. But I guess the worst happened,\" he said. He prefers one specific type of basmati rice, one that the store doesn't have any more of right now. \"Now I'm not going to be able to get my hands on it, I guess.\"\nSriram Ramamurthy, Manager of Iqbal Halal Foods in Toronto, says customers have been stockpiling rice after India moved to ban some exports.\n \n(Nisha Patel/CBC)\nRamamurthy\u00a0says he hasn't raised his prices yet, but he's expecting his suppliers to soon. Stores that cater to the South Asian market elsewhere in Canada are reporting similar scenes, including Savor Supermarket in Saskatoon, \nwhere purchases are being limited\n.\nStores in the U.S., Australia and elsewhere are\u00a0also seeing unprecedented demand, \nBloomberg and others reported Tuesday\n, although CBC News has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of videos showing hoarding and panic buying.\nPrices up sharply\nIndia has taken the extraordinary step in order to ensure domestic supply, and bring down prices, which have soared due to excess rains\u00a0and drought\u00a0in rice-producing regions.\nAccording to government data, the domestic price of non-basmati rice has increased by almost 10 per cent this month. In September of last year, a metric tonne of non-basmati rice in India would cost about $330 US. Today it tops $450, according to pricing in the most-traded Indian rice futures contract.\nStores have started to ration bags of rice after India's move to ban imports prompted stockpiling.\n \n(Nisha Patel/CBC)\nSophia Murphy,\u00a0executive director for the Minneapolis-based Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, says rice is such a staple for India and its 1.2 billion people\u00a0that the government manages supply closely. Unlike other food commodities, she says the global rice market is very domestically oriented, as less than 10 per cent of all the rice in the world ever crosses a border.\nWhile India is far and away the world's largest exporter of rice, with more than 40 per cent of international trade in it, their primary concern is maintaining domestic supply, which is why they have had export bans in the past, she says.\n\"If they ban or someway limit the exports, it should keep more production in the country and\u00a0it should reduce the inflation pressure that is there on\u00a0food prices,\" she said.\nCanada imported about $650 million worth of rice last year, according to government data. Within that, about $140 million came from India \u2014 and only a tiny percentage of that is of the\u00a0small- and medium-grain varieties of non-basmati rice that the ban applies to.\nMurphy says while supply of basmati may also be strained, the government did not move to ban exports since it is a more premium product. Local concern is on the other staple varieties, which is why the government used the dramatic step of halting exports.\n\"Bans are easy to explain to the public,\" she said, \"we're not selling food abroad, we're looking after people at home. It's often a pretty blunt \u2014\u00a0not necessarily very effective \u2014 instrument\u00a0but it has domestic political capital associated with it.\"\nIndia's move to ensure domestic supply is the second major announcement from a major exporter this year, as in May \nVietnam announced plans to limit its own exports\n to four million tonnes a year by 2030. That's down from more than seven million tonnes a year right now, and it's aimed at \"ensuring domestic food security, protecting the environment and adapting to climate change,\" the government said in a release.",

Police say she is believed to be travelling with her boyfriend, 53-year-old Abraxas Glazov, and her father, 74-year-old Robert Bolton.\nAccording to Monday's RCMP update on the search, investigators have information suggesting the group is living in trailers in a rural area somewhere.\nIn a photo released Thursday, Verity Bolton is pictured in a Kamloops, B.C., grocery store on July 15. \n \n(RCMP)\n\"The public is going to play a major role in locating Aurora and Joshuah,\" Sgt.

        "title": "B.C. woman waits for court to decide 'the truth' after losing breast to mistaken cancer diagnosis",
        "summary": "A B.C. Supreme Court civil jury awarded Elena Ivanova $400,000 in damages from the pathologist who wrongly diagnosed her with breast cancer. But the verdict has been held back and it will be months before Ivanova has a resolution.",
        "content": "When Elena Ivanova found a lump in her right breast after a skiing accident in early 2016, she wasn't too concerned. Years previously, after breast-feeding her two daughters, she'd noticed a similar mass\u00a0but it turned out to be nothing.\nIvanova wanted to be sure, though, so she went to see her family doctor. A mammogram and a biopsy followed, before a shocking appointment with a surgeon who told Ivanova she had a rare, aggressive cancer known as a metaplastic carcinoma.\n\"I couldn't believe it. Time stopped for me,\" the 61-year-old dog groomer from North Vancouver, B.C., said.\nJust nine days later, on March 24, 2016,\u00a0Ivanova underwent a total mastectomy, and braced herself for the punishing chemotherapy and radiation treatments that would follow.\nBut when it came time for her first appointment with an oncologist at B.C. Cancer to discuss a treatment plan, Ivanova was hit with another bombshell.\n\"The doctor said, 'I have good news. You don't have cancer,'\" she recalled in an interview with CBC News.\n\"It's hard to describe what I felt. For what I had this surgery? \u2026 I know it's good news, but it was very, very, very hard, because it's a human body. If you damage it, you can't restore it.\"\nFamilies ask why B.C. surgeon still allowed to see patients after string of negligence claims\nIn May, more than seven years after Ivanova had her breast removed, a B.C. Supreme Court civil jury awarded her $400,000 in damages from Dr. Robert Wolber, the pathologist who wrongly diagnosed her with cancer.\nBut Wolber is appealing that verdict, which means the bulk of the jury's award has been held back, and it will be months before Ivanova has a resolution.\nThe wait has been frustrating.\n\"I really wanted to find the truth,\" Ivanova said. \"People have to be protected. Mistakes like this shouldn't be done, and if they are done, it needs to be fixed.\"\n'Unclear, contradictory' biopsy report\nWolber has not responded to requests for comment. His\u00a0response to Ivanova's claim denied any negligence and maintained that \"all medical procedures and investigations carried out by him with respect to the plaintiff were appropriate to the circumstances and in accord with standard medical practice.\"\nThe response points out that while Wolber's\u00a0biopsy report did diagnose\u00a0Ivanova\u00a0with metaplastic carcinoma, his recommendation was for an excisional biopsy to remove the lump so it could be examined more closely, and not a mastectomy.\nBut Dr. Ashley Cimino-Mathews, a\u00a0pathologist at Johns Hopkins University in the U.S. who specializes in breast tumours, wrote in an expert witness report that an excisional biopsy would not be the appropriate response to such an aggressive cancer.\nHer report says Wolber's decision to \"unequivocally\" diagnose metaplastic breast carcinoma fell \"below the standard of care,\" and he should have communicated any uncertainty about the diagnosis in his biopsy report.\nIn finding Wolber negligent, the jury described Wolber's pathology report as \"confusing\" in light of the seriousness of the diagnosis.\n\"He diagnosed one illness and recommended treatment for another. This was unclear, contradictory and below the standard of care for a reasonably prudent pathologist,\" the jury wrote.\nElena Ivanova shows off one of her clients at Top Dog Groomers in North Vancouver, B.C., on July 21. Ivanova had a total mastectomy of her right breast in 2016 after she was wrongly diagnosed with a rare and aggressive cancer.\n \n(Justine Boulin/CBC)\nIvanova's lawyer, Don Renaud, said Wolber is exercising the same right to appeal that every Canadian enjoys, but the appeal court process will only add to the cost of an already very expensive legal fight.\nHe argues it's only possible for doctors to pour so much money into defending themselves from negligence allegations thanks to the deep pockets of the Canadian Medical Protective Association (CMPA).\nWant to sue your doctor? You'll be up against a powerful group with billions of dollars\nThe CMPA is a mutual defence organization that defends doctors accused of wrongdoing using assets valued at more than $6 billion. It's funded through annual fees paid by doctors, the bulk of which is \nreimbursed with public money\n through agreements with the provinces and territories.\n\"What really should have happened here is that, with appropriate public understanding of what took place, then those practices that led to this tragedy can be improved,\" Renaud said.\nA CMPA\u00a0spokesperson told CBC the organization was unable to comment on individual doctors, and it would be inappropriate to say anything about a matter that is still before the courts.\n'I threw away all my beautiful dresses'\nIvanova says the mastectomy has done lasting damage to her physical and mental health.\n\"I was always in good physical condition, but after the surgery\u00a0I started to have nightmares. I couldn't sleep properly,\" she said.\n\"I don't feel like I'm an attractive woman anymore. I have to hide my damage. I threw away all my beautiful dresses.\"\nShe says she loves to hike, but ongoing weakness means she can no longer manage the same intensity on her mountain treks. Yoga leaves her with back pain she's never had before.\n\"It's hard to accept,\" she said of her new reality.\nIvanova's lawsuit also accused the surgeon who performed her surgery of negligence, but the jury found she did not breach the standard of care.\nWATCH | Elena Ivanova discusses the impact of the diagnosis on her life:\nB.C. woman talks about the psychological impact of her mistaken cancer diagnosis\n9 hours ago\nDuration \n0:37\nElena Ivanova, who had a total mastectomy after she was wrongly diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, says she has trouble trusting doctors now.\nBoy, 5, overdosed on meds 14 times stronger than prescribed \u2014 and regulator didn't punish pharmacy for error\nAnti-vaccine doctor's fans flood court, claiming to be 'common-law grand jury' in his $66.6M lawsuit\nToday, Ivanova believes anyone who finds themselves with a scary diagnosis and drastic treatment recommendations\u00a0shouldn't be afraid to advocate for more information from their doctors.\n\"They are good, they're highly educated, but they have to give you more time, more attention. If you get one opinion, get a second opinion, third opinion,\" she said.\n\"Ask them to explain 10,000 times. It's their job to explain to you properly. We are not doctors.\"",

Kickoff is Saturday at 2 p.m. CST.\nLast Saturday in Vancouver, the Riders managed just three Brett Lauther field goals, losing 19-9 to the Lions.\nThe Roughriders' defence forced four turnovers against B.C. but the offence could not capitalize.\nSask. Roughriders fall to a 3-3 record after losing a defensive battle against the B.C. Lions\nMason Fine got his first start of the season and went 31 of 42 for 282 yards and two interceptions.\nFine said the team missed opportunities to score.\n\"Not scoring touchdowns \u2014 it's literally just maybe one guy on every single play that maybe does not do their job or some small, minute detail that stops you from getting a touchdown or getting that one first down or maybe draws a penalty to not keep that drive going,\" he said.\nThe team has to clean up its execution, Fine said, and his play-caller agrees.\n\"I was just disappointed that we didn't come away with more points,\"\u00a0said offensive co-ordinator Kelly Jeffrey.\u00a0\"The defence played awesome. Special teams were great. We got all kinds of takeaways with our defence and we had good field position.\"\n\"We need to be better and we will be. The guys are frankly pretty pissed off at the way things came down and we're going to be better this week.\"\nRiders' offensive co-ordinator Kelly Jeffrey says the players are \"pretty pissed off\" at how Saturday's game in B.C. turned out.\n \n(Adam Bent/CBC)\nJeffrey said he would not characterize the Roughriders offence as \"conservative,\" given the 41 pass attempts by Fine.\n\"We needed a little bit more help in the run game. I think that would have made a huge difference in some of those short-yardage plays. He had one interception that was a wrong route by a receiver that kind of duped him into throwing the wrong ball.\"\nThe Riders managed just 16 yards along the ground on 14 attempts for a 1.1-yard average.\nJeffrey said the team was working with a new offensive line combination and lost its ability to play five receiver sets when Mitch Picton was lost to injury.\n\"It wasn't a conservative game plan or play-calling. Some of the circumstances dictated it and with a new quarterback, you always want to be a little bit cautious going in. You want to get him some completions to get his feet wet.\"\nLISTEN\u00a0| Roughriders talk Trevor Harris injury, QB situation\n \nThe Afternoon Edition - Sask\n5:31\nRoughriders talk Trevor Harris injury, QB situation\nJeremy O'Day is general manager of the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He talked to reporters about the status of Trevor Harris and what the team plans to do with its quarterbacks moving forward.\nJeffrey said he did not limit the playbook for Fine, who is in his third year with the team.\n\"I can put together a much better game plan in terms of play-calling. I probably got a little bit too shot-happy down in the red zone and we can take some shorter passes and run the ball a little bit more to get touchdowns instead of coming away with field goals.\"\nJeffrey said taking more \"shots\" down the field is a goal.\n\"I love shots down the field. That's my jam. But you still gotta protect it. You still gotta make sure you are running the ball well to do it. If you can't run the ball well, no one's really gonna buy when you do some heavy play-action stuff.\"\nLack of TDs over three weeks\nThird-year quarterback Mason Fine has played in just over four quarters during the past three games. Much of the Riders' lack of scoring came with starting quarterback Trevor Harris under centre and against the Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Elks who are a combined 2-11. All three Roughrider wins have come against those two clubs.\nIn the past three weeks, the Riders have managed just three offensive touchdowns during 12 quarters of football. All three have come late in the fourth quarter. By comparison, Roughriders return specialist Mario Alford had two punt return touchdowns against Calgary in Week 6. Here's how the Riders scored their three offensive touchdowns:\nIn Week 5, Trevor Harris TD pass to Mitch Picton with 1:06 left.\nIn Week 6, Mason Fine TD pass to Jamal Morrow with under three minutes to go.\nFine to Tevin Jones for a 69-yard TD with 0:42 left on 3rd and 24.\nHead coach Craig Dickenson said he does not think one thing is causing the lack of scoring punch but pointed to injuries as playing a role.\n\"I don't know if there's one thing or another. [B.C.]\u00a0is a good defence. We still haven't gotten into, in my opinion, a real good rhythm because we're still lacking a little bit of continuity.\"\n\"Hopefully with Jake [Wieneke]\u00a0back and with Peter [Godber]\u00a0back, we're hoping we can get the same crew out there a couple of weeks in a row.\"\nSaskatchewan Roughriders' Tevin Jones (14) dives but fails to make the reception late in Saturday's game.\n \n(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\nDickenson did not have an update on Roughriders who did not practise on Tuesday. Receivers\u00a0Picton, Jones and Kendall Watson did not participate but were not ruled out for the upcoming game.\nFine should have his centre Godber, and two big targets back in the lineup. Wieneke is returning after a knee injury caused him to miss three games. Canadian slotback Brayden Lenius has not yet played this season and could be headed to Halifax.\n\"They're great people and they love the game and they're good energy dudes. It's good to have both Brayden and Jake back. And their legs were a little tired today. We'll get them back and hopefully, they both play on game day,\" Dickenson said.\nReceiver Kian Schaffer-Baker has been taken off the six-game injured list but Dickenson said he is not expected back until the Labour Day Classic against Winnipeg.\nThe Riders brought in a CFL veteran to shore up their\u00a0defence\u00a0\u2014\u00a028-year-old Trumaine Washington was signed today.\n\"We feel like our secondary is a little thin with Rolan\u00a0[Milligan]\u00a0going down and we wanted a guy who's got CFL experience and he's a real grinder and he's physical. He's not a real tall guy but he competes very hard and Trumaine is going to help us at some point this year.\"",

        "content": "A group of parents is gathering funds to restore a never-used residence on Mayne Island\u00a0in hopes it will attract teachers to\u00a0live and work there.\nJackie Henry, whose two children are among the 29 K-7 students at Mayne Island School, said the facility\u00a0has had challenges in finding and retaining staff due to its relatively limited access and the difficulty in finding accommodation on the Gulf Island in southwest British Columbia.\n\"People come and they teach for a year, and then they don't come back. A lot of the reason is the commute. Most of our teacher pool is from Salt Spring Island, so they'll come over on the school boat and they have to leave the house at 5 a.m., and they get home at 7 [p.m.],\" Henry told CBC News.\n\"It's a challenging commute for people, so they don't tend to last long.\"\nAn anonymous donor is offering up to $15K to attract teachers to this B.C. school district\nThis past year, Henry said the teacher for grades 3-7 took a new job after just two weeks working on Mayne Island\u00a0and the school was unable to fill the position for half of the school year\u00a0because applicants couldn't find accommodation.\nThat class had a series of rotating, on-call teachers, and when no one was available\u00a0the principal would teach.\nBut now the parent advisory committee (PAC) has turned its attention to an abandoned teacherage, which was first brought to Mayne Island in the 1980s, with the aim of restoring it to provide\u00a0accommodation.\nHenry said the PAC thinks the empty house, which was never used, presents the perfect solution \u2014 and the Gulf Islands School District, which owns the house, agrees.\nDespite teacher shortages, some new grads still face roadblocks getting into classrooms\nThe PAC has now signed an agreement to restore the teacherage, with the school district handing over the property and parents raising the funds to complete the work.\nThe school district has agreed to rent the restored house to teachers and school staff at a below-market rate, and keep that money in trust to maintain the building in the future.\n\"It is a credit to the Mayne Island community and the PAC leadership that saw an opportunity and approached the district with an idea,\" school district superintendent Scott Benwell said in a statement.\nHenry said the response from the Mayne Island community has been passionate so far. Many islanders have donated time, money\u00a0and resources to the PAC to get the job done, including the owner of the island's Home Hardware, who donated a large portion of the materials needed for the restoration.\nSomeone from Sidney, B.C., meanwhile, has offered to donate a heat pump system for the house \u2014\u00a0something the PAC hadn't even considered because it would have been beyond its budget.\nDistrict's job ad seeking uncertified teachers sparks urgent calls to solve B.C.'s shortage of classroom staff\nThe PAC is aiming to raise $80,000 for the restoration and within one week of fundraising\u00a0had\u00a0already received $10,000.\n\"The biggest take-home is that this is a creative way to solve a problem. The community is coming together.\u00a0And we're not trying to build a new building for $10 million \u2026 this is something that exists. It's a taxpayer resource that's being underutilized,\" Henry said.\n\"We just want to get it back to working order and then have it as something that's going to benefit the future of the Mayne Island School and its students and teachers.\"\nB.C. teachers' union warns of possible staff shortages this school year\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Education acknowledged that the tight labour market has affected school districts across the province.\nIt said it's working with school districts, unions\u00a0and other partners to address challenges with recruitment and retention of teachers, and pointed to measures like increased wages, increased spaces in teacher education programs, and reduced processing times for teacher certification.",

And the beach is frequently overrun by seagulls.\u00a0\nOn a technical level, it would seem hard-pressed to defeat Alouette\u00a0Lake, with its campgrounds and opportunities for windsurfing.\nBut what makes a good lake can mean different things to different people.\u00a0\nRecap of how it works!\nAfter competitions to find the best\u00a0\nneighbourhood in Metro Vancouver\n\u00a0and\u00a0\nsmall town in B.C.\n, we're doing a contest that unites both groups \u2014 heading to the best lake in the summertime.\nThe\u00a0\nSearch for B.C.'s Best Lake\n\u00a0began \nMonday\n, and over the next two weeks, we'll have a series of votes to (unofficially) determine which one is tops in the province.\u00a0\nA series of play-in votes narrowed the field down to 48 lakes, which we've divided into two sections, those in the southwest corner of the province (including Vancouver Island) and those beyond Hope.\u00a0\nIn both sections, eight lakes received automatic byes to the second round \u2014 including Trout Lake \u2014 and they enter the competition today [July 25].\u00a0\nWe'll go from\u00a032 lakes to 16, to 8, 4 and 2 until we crown a champion right before B.C. Day.\u00a0\nVoting will take place until 10 p.m. PT each day.\u00a0\nHappy voting \u2014 and may the best lake win!\u00a0\n(If your vote is unable to go through on this page, click on the link below each ballot)\nSouthwest B.C.

The children are the subject of an Amber Alert and believed to be with their mother, Verity Bolton.\n \n(Supplied by RCMP)\nMother Verity Bolton is suspected of abducting the two children after she failed to return them to their father from a planned vacation. Police say she is believed to be travelling with her boyfriend, 53-year-old Abraxas Glazov, and her father, 74-year-old Robert Bolton.\nOn Monday, RCMP announced that they believe the alleged abduction was pre-planned, and the siblings have been taken to live \"off the grid\" in trailers in a rural area.\nPolice say they've received more than 180 tips about the children's whereabouts since the Amber Alert began last Wednesday. There have been no confirmed sightings of Aurora or Joshuah since July 7, when they were seen at a gas station in Merritt.\nThe last confirmed sighting of Verity Bolton was at a grocery store in Kamloops on July 15.\nIn a photo released last week, Verity Bolton is pictured in a Kamloops, B.C., grocery store on July 15. \n \n(RCMP)\nInvestigators say she is driving a dark blue Dodge Ram 2500 truck, and she has been seen towing a number of trailers.\nSurrey RCMP launched an Amber Alert for the two missing children on July 19.\nPolice said anyone who sees the truck or the children is advised not to approach them and immediately call 911.\nPolice have released photos of Robert Bolton, 74, left, and Abraxas Glazov, 53, right, who are believed to be travelling with Verity Bolton and her two children. \n \n(Surrey RCMP)\nVerity is described as a white woman standing five feet two inches tall and weighing 119 pounds. She has brown hair and brown eyes and usually has long hair tied back in a ponytail. She was last seen in black cargo pants and a black sweater.\nAurora is described as three feet 11 inches tall, weighing 55 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. Her left front upper tooth is chipped, according to police, and she has small freckles on her face.\nRCMP released images of the truck and trailer Verity Bolton was spotted driving in on July 15, which is described as a white bumper pull horse/utility style trailer being towed by a dark blue 2012 Dodge Ram 2500 with the B.C. licence plate SJ2708.\n \n(RCMP)\nPolice say she has shoulder-length hair, slightly curled and likely braided. She was last seen wearing a blue dress with coloured flowers on it.\nJoshuah is described as four feet 10 inches tall, weighing 70 pounds, with brown hair, blue eyes and short hair in a buzz cut that is growing out. He was last seen wearing shorts and a T-shirt.\nPolice say Verity Bolton usually has long hair tied in a ponytail. She was last seen wearing black cargo pants and a black sweater.\n \n(Lower Mainland RCMP/Twitter)\nFull statement from family of Aurora and Joshuah Bolton:\nOur family would like to share with you the love and joy that Aurora and Joshuah bring to our lives every day. They are so much more than \"missing children,\"\u00a0more than a few photos.\nThe love they share with their big sisters and brother is beyond beautiful, and the impact on their siblings is so devastating. They love the time they spend playing with them, loving them and teasing them, it is a very big part of their world.\u00a0\nWe have a routine at home, we share, we help, we tease and love each other beyond words. They are exceptionally close to their entire extended family and especially to their many cousins, who they visit often, enjoy swimming, sleep-overs and playing outdoors, having the best time!\u00a0 \nAt home,\u00a0Joshuah loves to help with the cooking, but not the dishes. He loves to spend time playing online games, chatting with his best friends (but will drop everything for a walk with his Stepmom). He will run down from his room mid-game to give a hug & a kiss and share a silly video, or a \"hilarious'\"fart joke.\u00a0 \nAurora is the sweetest girl and is an amazing helper too. Always keeping herself busy with crafts, trying new things and creating. We have a dance party with her before bed, so she brushes her teeth more than 30 seconds, then gets a special bedtime ritual of hugs and kisses. Both kids love a good 'scratch-back' before bed, and we take this time to chat and connect with them one-on-one. They share their day, their hurts, their questions with us, and then go to bed with a good snuggle and kiss.\u00a0\nThey love family picnics and movie nights with popcorn, making slime with maximum mess, trying silly experiments, playing silly pranks, water fights in the front yard with the neighbours, friends, play-dates and birthday parties.\u00a0\nTheir home, routine, friends, best friends, many cousins, aunties, uncles and grand-parents miss them more than can be expressed. They are loved so very, very much, and are so very missed.",

The Horsethief Creek fire is burning in the\u00a0mountains 10 kilometres west of Invermere and seven kilometres north of the Panorama Mountain Resort.\n\"It's very worrisome,\" said Karyn Richardson, holding her granddaughter's hand as they walked\u00a0down Seventh Avenue.\u00a0\"We have a go bag ready, just in case.\"\nMark Sharpe, who lives about five kilometres from Mt. Bruce, where the fire is located, said it grew quickly due to hot, dry, windy weather. After it was\u00a0first spotted Monday afternoon, the fire burned three square kilometres in less than 24 hours.\u00a0But Sharpe, who has been watching closely, says it\u00a0appeared to hold overnight.\n\"All in all, with the wind heading north, I don't think this fire moved much overnight,\" he told \nRadio West\n host Sarah Penton.\u00a0\n\"I think everything's feeling pretty safe,\" he said.\nThe B.C. Wildfire Service (BCWS) said crews have had trouble determining the exact size of the fire because of the thick\u00a0smoke and challenging flying conditions. As of Tuesday evening, the service reported that the fire covers\u00a0about 10 square kilometres.\nInvermere is not included in the evacuation alerts or orders. People walking through the community Tuesday said the fire had improved from Monday when flames and thick smoke were seen billowing up from the hill. The fire glowed an unnerving shade of orange as night fell, one couple said.\nInvermere Mayor Al Miller is pictured in the community on July 25, 2023.\n \n(Gian-Paolo Mendoza/CBC)\nMayor Al Miller said neighbours jumped to help ranchers move their horses and cattle to safety as the fire grew.\n\"It's certainly looking very smoky,\" he told host Chris Walker on CBC's \nDaybreak South\n Tuesday morning. \"It was pretty scary for a lot of people.\"\nHe said it's been at least a decade since the community has seen a fire such as this.\u00a0\n\"A fire this visible and this close?

        "content": "More large-scale disputes like the industrial action at British Columbia's ports may be on the horizon, a labour movement researcher is warning, as longshore workers gathered to consider a possible agreement with employers.\nThe local chapters of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union held meetings Tuesday to discuss the deal, which the B.C. Maritime Employers Association says is the same agreement union leaders had previously rejected without a full-membership vote.\nMcGill University associate professor of sociology Barry Eidlin said it is likely union leaders are under pressure to sell the deal to members due to the possibility of back-to-work legislation \u2014\u00a0even if federal officials have said publicly that resolution-by-negotiation is the preferred outcome.\nBut Eidlin said members are aware their leadership previously rejected the deal, which \"doesn't send a strong signal\" about the quality of the deal and gives the impression it is instead getting \"rammed through.\"\nWATCH | What the 13-day port strike means for Canadians:\u00a0\nWhat the B.C. port strike means for Canada\n18 days ago\nDuration \n3:45\nWorkers at ports across B.C. are on strike. We break down why it's happening and what it means for you and for Canada's economy.\nEidlin also said the full membership may not be receptive to the deal, given that issues such as automation and jurisdiction of maintenance work may be \"existential\" for the long-term viability of these workers' jobs.\n\"This isn't just about dollars and cents or a pension increase,\" Eidlin said. \"Not that those things aren't important, but these are really some fundamental issues about the future of what work on the dock is going to look like.\n\"Even if you have the threat of back-to-work legislation looming over the whole process, I think the issues at stake are of such import that members are going to think really hard about what the language in this contract is \u2014 and whether or not they can live with it.\"\nThe International Longshore and Warehouse Union Canada and the B.C. Maritime Employers Association agreed to a tentative four-year deal on Thursday morning, ending a 13-day shutdown of more than 30 ports in B.C., including Canada's largest, the Port of Vancouver. \n \n(Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press)\nHe said similar issues facing workers in other industries, along with the mounting challenges of cost of living and workplace flexibility, may be changing the labour movement's calculations on whether to use strike action as a negotiating tactic \u2014 something that has essentially flatlined since the 1990s.\n\"I think the current moment that we're living in suggests that we could have reached some sort of breaking point, where enough workers are saying, 'We've had enough, we need to do something.\"'\nILWU members filed into meetings at Vancouver's Croatian Cultural Centre Tuesday morning to hear from leaders of the Local 500 chapter, representing longshore and other port workers in the city.\nSeveral workers attending the meeting declined to comment to media.\nUnion leadership recommends members accept tentative deal to avoid another B.C. port strike\n2nd tentative deal reached in B.C. port strike: union\nThe labour dispute triggered a 13-day strike that started on Canada Day, stopping billions of dollars' worth of goods from moving in and out of some of the country's busiest ports.\nStrike action was suspended when the contract was reached with the help of a mediator two weeks ago, but it was then reinstated when the union leadership turned down the plan early last week.\nA labour board then ruled the second strike action by the port workers was illegal, prompting the union to issue 72-hour strike notice, which it then reversed hours later.\nCourt decisions may limit back-to-work legislation\nDalhousie University Schulich School of Law assistant professor Liam McHugh-Russell called the tumultuous developments \"uncommon but not unheard of\" in labour negotiation.\nMcHugh-Russell said while there had been calls from provincial and business leaders for back-to-work legislation, the federal government has been hesitant to go down that path since landmark Supreme Court rulings in 2007 and 2015.\nThose rulings are reflected in the government's handling of the port dispute up to this point, he said.\nA law professor says Supreme Courts have enshrined workers' rights over the past two decades, which means back-to-work legislation is seen as harder for the federal government.\n \n(Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press)\nThe 2007 decision makes collective bargaining a constitutional right, and the 2015 ruling added the right to strike.\n\"We are seeing to some degree a playing-out of a shift and a change in the constitutional context in which strikes are played out,\" McHugh-Russell said.\n\"[The Supreme Court decisions]\u00a0have really put the brakes on the ability and willingness of government to bring in legislative solutions to these problems.\"\nUnion members are expected to vote on the offer later this week, but there's no word yet on when the results could be made public.",

She testified that once the profiles were created, lab workers returned the DNA to test tubes so they could then be given back to police investigators. Li said there were 20 tubes to begin with. The DNA extraction process doubled the number of tubes needed, bringing the total to 40.\nJury hears DNA witnesses during 1st-degree murder trial of man accused in death of B.C. teen\nDuring this transfer, Li said they noticed skin DNA was leaking through the bottom of a test tube, which had a small pinhole at the bottom. The remainder of the sample was transferred to another tube.\nLi said the tube had a manufacturing defect and told prosecutors the incident was the only issue recorded by lab workers during the analysis, which followed all standard operating procedures, including operational reviews and sign-offs by other qualified DNA analysts. The remaining tubes were secure, she said.\nArrest video of Ibrahim Ali released; Crown focuses on phone records\n\"My controls were satisfactory,\" Li told prosecutor Colleen Smith. \"No contamination was detected.\"\nLi is among the DNA witnesses called to testify during the first-degree murder trial of Ibrahim Ali.\nWATCH | Police search of Ibrahim Ali moments after his 2018 arrest played for jurors:\nMan accused of killing Burnaby teen searched following his arrest\n15 days ago\nDuration \n1:01\nVideo shows police bringing Ibrahim Ali, suspected of killing a 13-year-old girl, into the Burnaby RCMP detachment on Sept. 7, 2018.\nIn her opening statement, Crown prosecutor Isobel Keeley said a 13-year-old victim, whose name is protected by a publication ban,\u00a0was passing through Burnaby Central Park on July 18, 2017, when she was attacked and dragged into the woods before she was sexually assaulted and strangled to death.\nProsecutors say DNA evidence will connect Ali to the crime.\nPolice officer forgot to record arrest of Ibrahim Ali, jury trial hears\nTimeline, contamination questions\nDuring cross-examination, defence counsel Kevin McCullough\u00a0asked Li if she knew why she was performing analysis on samples that were four years old. Her work was done in 2021, but the alleged murder took place in 2017, and Ali was arrested in 2018.\nLi said she did not know\u00a0nor\u00a0was ever told the particulars of the case or who the samples came from.\nThus far in the trial, no witnesses have testified as to why these samples were analyzed for DNA after Ali was in custody. Li did note the pandemic created a backlog for lab work but was unsure if it had an impact on this analysis.\nMcCullough also asked about the defective tube, asking if the sample could have been contaminated. Li said the hole was only discovered post-analysis, and no contamination was found.\nLi said other test tubes at the lab come from the same manufacturer, but no similar defects were recorded during her work.\nSupport is available for anyone who has been sexually assaulted.

        "summary": "Soaring hay prices due to an ongoing drought in B.C. have made it more expensive for ranchers across the province to feed their cattle.",
        "content": "British Columbia rancher Suzanne Fradette had just got off the phone with a hay broker who had grim news amid an ongoing drought that has sent feed prices soaring: \"It's bad out there.\"\n\"We've got a fairly small herd, like 140 head, but we are thinking it's going to be about $100,000 this year for hay,\" said Fradette.\nThat's a 30-per-cent jump compared to recent years, and a painful price for a relatively small ranch.\nFradette runs the Back Valley Ranch ranch with partner Jerry Steves in the Deadmans' area between Savona and Cache Creek, about 350 kilometres northeast of Vancouver.\nFradette said they are just \"keeping their heads above water,\" getting by one day at a time. Feeding their herd costs about $700 per day.\nFradette and Steves aren't alone in their plight, with drought conditions pushing up feed prices across much of the country.\nDrought conditions force B.C. cattle ranchers to consider selling their herds\nAgriculture Canada's most recent drought monitor report says 76 per cent of the country's agricultural landscape is either abnormally dry or experiencing moderate to severe drought this summer.\nThe B.C. Ministry of Emergency Management and Climate Readiness says most of the province remains at either Level 4 or 5 drought conditions, urging people and businesses to continue to conserve water, even as the first rain in more than a month falls this week on Metro Vancouver.\nB.C. rancher Suzanne Fradette's cattle is pictured here in an undated handout photo. Fradette says that in previous years, her phone would be ringing with offers of hay to feed her livestock, but things have changed this year.\n \n(HO-Suzanne Fradette/The Canadian Press)\nLow precipitation and historically early snowmelt have already pushed eight of B.C.'s 34 water basins into the worst Level 5 drought category, when all efforts should be made to conserve water and protect critical environmental flows. A further 13 are at Level 4, meaning harm to ecosystems and communities is likely.\nFradette said that in previous years, her phone would be ringing briskly with offers of hay to feed her livestock, but things have changed this year.\n\"This time, I'm trying to phone around about it. There is no hay,'' she said, adding\u00a0ranchers and farmers are struggling to get by.\n\"I always make the joke, I'm like, 'I don't want to be rich, rich. I just want to be change-my-oil-when-I-need-to rich.' That's our goal right there.\"\n'An animal welfare issue'\nKevin Boon with the B.C. Cattlemen's Association said the province-wide drought conditions are in contrast to years past because drought-related feed shortages in one part of B.C. could be made up for elsewhere.\nRanchers are facing increased costs to feed their herds, he said, but that is secondary to the availability of feed.\n\"This is an animal welfare issue and this is an issue where we, as farmers and ranchers, have to care for our animals and so decisions have to be made at some point in time,\"\u00a0he said.\nDrought in B.C. has caused a hay shortage \u2014 and that's forcing ranchers to consider thinning herds\n\"If they can't access feed, they are going to have to make a hard decision of what to do with those animals.\"\nBoon said they have had some success finding producers with hay at a reasonable price, but transporting feed from elsewhere is costly.\nHe said the persistent drought conditions have created the immediate challenge of sourcing feed and hay, but also raised questions over the long-term of how to store and properly allocate water in the future.\nFor now, Boon said farmers can only hope for more rain in the forecast with \"Mother Nature willing.\"\n'Next year is my biggest concern'\nThe B.C. government said Tuesday that it's partnering with the B.C. Cattlemen's Association to match farmers in need of feed and hay with suppliers elsewhere, including the United States.\n\"We know all of Western Canada is being impacted by drought, so we're looking at other jurisdictions where there may be some surplus hay,\"\u00a0Agriculture Minister Pam Alexis said at a news conference.\nAlexis said the province has also received approval from the federal government to provide advance payments to farmers with cash flow issues under the AgriStability program.\nB.C. Minister of Agriculture and Food Pam Alexis said the province is working with B.C. Cattlemen's Association to match farmers in need of hay with suppliers in the United States and beyond. \n \n(Justine Boulin/CBC)\nAndy Wolfe, who operates Mount Lehman Farm, a family-owned beef ranch with 140 head of cattle in Abbotsford, B.C., said that thanks to \"his farmer intuition,\" he planned ahead this year to find three different suppliers to secure enough hay to cover him until next year.\n\"I basically took all the supply I could get from about three different local suppliers where normally I would be dealing with just one.\"\nWolfe said loss of farmland to industrial usage led to shrinking production of hay, a problem compounded by the drought, and that hay prices were skyrocketing: large bales that cost $65 last year are now $130, and even that price required negotiation with suppliers.\nAtlantic farmers' surplus hay heading to drought-stricken Prairies\n\"Most people are paying way more,'' said Wolfe, adding that some ranchers had to downsize their herd because of the hay shortage.\nAlthough Wolfe said he has enough hay to make it through the year, he's already worrying about next year.\n\"My concern is if this year's drought is going to affect next year's prices,'' said Wolfe.\n\"I made it through this year and I am going to be OK this winter, but if the drought continues, I don't know what I'm going to have to pay for hay. Next year is my biggest concern.\"",

Wildfire Service (BCWS)\u00a0remains cautious because it may not fall evenly across the large area of the fire.\nThe Donnie Creek fire is the largest blaze on record in the 102-year history of provincial firefighting efforts, and its\n massive size helped lift B.C. to a record wildfire season for area burned \u2014 which currently stands at almost 15,000 square kilometres.\nBurial grounds, wild animals, and food for elders: What's burning inside B.C.'s largest wildfire\nDespite the rain, crews carried out a number of planned ignitions around the fire on Sunday, covering the northwest corner of the blaze, the BCWS said in a tweet.\nThe Donnie Creek wildfire is burning in area with valuable timber and oil and gas facilities.\n \n(B.C. Wildfire Service)\nIt said the ignitions solidified containment lines against the fire, and Caranci says crews will now wait until this week's rain has passed before reassessing and determining if\u00a0additional burns are necessary or possible.\nWhile the rainfall will help, Caranci says current BCWS estimates show the precipitation will not be season-ending\u00a0for the northern region's wildfires, and the\u00a0Donnie Creek blaze is still anticipated to be active into the fall.\nWhat happens after the Donnie Creek wildfire, now larger than P.E.I., stops burning?\nStill, Caranci says the rain will likely dampen things down\u00a0over the next seven to 10 days, allowing firefighters some breathing room.\nShe says it will give them time to make headway on smaller objectives for their overall plan, since attacking a fire of this size requires them to fight portions of the blaze at a time.",
