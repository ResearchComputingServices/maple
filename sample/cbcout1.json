That's partly due to the methane emissions that come from 'cow burps.'\n \n(Rachel Maclean/CBC)\nDyer suggests people should generally choose pork over beef when they want to eat red meat, and opt for grass-fed over grain-fed beef when possible.\nCow burps targeted as researchers look at ways to reduce methane emissions\nAs for McAllister, he said it's up to people to decide for themselves what to eat, whether that includes meat and how much.\n\"But they need to realize that there's trade-offs. There's no one perfect food production system,\" he said.\nPlans to boost beef exports\nBeyond pointing out the role that cattle play in preserving grasslands, \nthe industry has also pledged\n to reduce its carbon intensity overall, including a commitment to cut a third of its primary production greenhouse gas emission intensity by 2030.\nAsked about progress made toward\u00a0that goal, the chair of the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef,\u00a0Ryan Beierbach, said in an interview that an assessment has just wrapped up and results will be released to the public soon.\nWhat on Earth?\nGrasslands store tons of carbon \u2014 and there's a movement to protect them\nThe federal government, for its part, has expressed a vote of confidence in the industry and its sustainability objectives. At a funding announcement held at the Calgary Stampede last week, officials applauded the Canadian cattle sector \u2014 with a representative for the federal agriculture minister saying the industry has done a \"tremendous job at raising beef sustainably.\"\nIn a news release\n, the government\u00a0touted a figure from the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, which said the overall greenhouse gas emissions of Canadian beef production have a total footprint of 11.4 kilograms\u00a0CO2 equivalent, which it says is less than half the world's average.\nMP Francis Drouin, parliamentary secretary to Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, is shown at a funding announcement about sustainable agriculture at the Calgary Stampede last week.\n \n(Paula Duhatschek/CBC)\n\"That's the story that we want to tell the world, and today's announcement is actually going to help tell that story around the world,\" MP Francis Drouin, parliamentary secretary to Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, said at an \nannouncement\n that pledged \n$12 million\n for research into sustainable agriculture.\nDrouin said the notion that people should simply stop eating beef to reduce their environmental impact is a \"failing strategy\" and that the focus should instead be on decarbonizing the process of cattle production.\nJapan reopens its doors to imports of Canadian beef\nWhile Canadian beef exports still \nlag behind other countries\n, such as the United States and Brazil, the federal government hopes to ramp them\u00a0up in the years ahead. Japan has reopened its doors to \nCanadian imports\n, and Ottawa plans to open a new Indo-Pacific Agriculture and Agri-Food office in \nManila, the capital of the Philippines\n.\n\"The world is looking for Canadian beef, [and] we know that we have a tremendous great story to tell,\" Drouin\u00a0said.\nHow much does sustainability matter?\u00a0\nBack at home, though, it's not clear if consumers'\u00a0perception of beef and sustainability will make much of a difference to the industry's bottom line.\nKevin Grier, a livestock and meat market analyst based in Guelph, Ont., said while consumers may say environmental issues matter to them, taste and price tend to beat out those concerns when it comes to choices at the grocery store.\nBoth grass-fed and grain-fed beef production are more carbon-intensive than pork production, according to a research report prepared in 2021 for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.\n \n(Monica Kidd)\nDespite \nrising rates of vegetarianism\n, Statistics Canada data shows that Canadians' demand for beef has remained \"very, very strong,\" tempered only slightly by high prices, he said.\nThose prices are expected to continue to move higher as western Canadian beef producers deal with drought conditions and some ranchers \ncull their herds\n. Fresh and frozen beef prices \nrose nine\u00a0per cent in the past year\n, outpacing other protein sources.\n\"That's the issue I think that's interesting, is what role beef is going to play in the meat case in the next couple of years,\" Grier\u00a0said.\nThere are fewer cows around and that's partly why your beef is so expensive\nNature Conservancy of Canada touts plan to protect 5,000 square km of Prairie grasslands\nAs for Ryder Lee, the CCA's general manager, he said\u00a0talking about sustainability has become a priority whether it translates to sales or not.\n\"Public opinion builds up over time,\" he said. \"If we just stick to our knitting and raise cattle and don't talk about what we're doing, what we've found is decisions get made for us.\nAbout\u00a017 Alberta schools have so far registered to use the\u00a0\nGuardians\n\u00a0computer game.

Unlike traditional social networks, the fediverse allows users to connect and communicate with others seamlessly across multiple platforms.\nThreads, a new social platform by Meta, signed up more than 100 million users in its first five days.\n \n(Ashley Fraser/CBC)\nProponents\u00a0say it's similar to the early days of the internet, when Big Tech hadn't yet created social media sites that rely on advertising and use algorithms to keep you scrolling on their platforms.\n\"You can have an account on one service and you can post on other services,\" said Evan Prodromou, an entrepreneur and technologist based in Montreal. \"Other people can read your stuff; they can connect to you. You can have relationships and friendships \u2014 family relationships that don't depend on which actual service you're using. So, that's the fediverse promise.\"\nThink of it like email. There are many different email domains available, from Gmail to Outlook. Even if you use a different service than your friend, you can still communicate with one another.\n\"We're using social networking for what it was originally meant for, which is giving us better social relationships,\" said Prodromou. \"So, it's not about the platforms, it's about the people.\"\nHow did the fediverse start?\u00a0\nProdromou is often credited as a pioneer of the fediverse, although he points out it's based on patterns and structures that go back to the very beginning of the internet.\nIn 2008, he created a website called identi.ca, which was a distributed social network similar to Twitter.\u00a0At the time, blogs were popular and people would use software\u00a0such as feed aggregators to bring them together in one place.\n\"My kind of incentive in building identi.ca and the original federated social networks was to take that experience and bring it into that social network interface,\" said Prodromou.\nWhat made identi.ca different was the development of a standard that let people download the software, install it on their own servers and then communicate directly with their users, as if they were on the same server.\u00a0\nAnother breakthrough was the release of\u00a0Mastodon in 2017 by German developer Eugen Rochko.\nEvan Prodromou, who lives in Montreal, helped create ActivityPub, a decentralized social networking protocol that much of the fediverse is developed on. \n \n(Amita June Prodromou)\nSimilar to Twitter, Mastodon is a micro-blogging platform and one of the larger self-hosted social networking spaces on the fediverse. Small groups or individuals run independent communities or \"instances\" on their own servers, and they have their own terms of service and moderation rules.\u00a0\nIn 2018, the organization that set standards for the World Wide Web, known as the W3C, wanted to have a modern standard for distributed social networks such as Mastodon.\nThey started a group \u2014 co-chaired by Prodromou \u2014 called the Social Web Working Group.\u00a0\nProdromou worked with four others, including Christine Lemmer-Webber, Jessica Tallon, Erin Shepherd, and Amy Guy, to develop the standards that make up the ActivityPub protocol.\nIt's an open, decentralized social networking protocol that much of the fediverse is now developed on, including Mastodon and other services, such as Pixelfed, a photo-sharing platform similar to Instagram.\nWhy are people moving to the fediverse?\nWhen scrolling on Facebook, TikTok or other mainstream social platforms, you might notice content from accounts you don't follow. Those platforms\u00a0use an algorithm to show you content based on data they've gathered on you, including what you've previously engaged with.\nThe fediverse doesn't rely on algorithms or data scraping in the same way. Mastodon, for example, will show you the content of people and instances you follow in chronological order.\nThis creates a less stressful environment, Prodromou says, because your feed isn't designed to keep you on\u00a0the platform.\nThe servers that make up the fediverse cost money to run, but revenue from advertisements aren't the primary way of\u00a0maintaining them. Individuals and groups have their own methods, including subscription fees or donations.\nAre you on Threads yet? Here's what you're giving away\nMeta's Threads now fastest-growing platform after 100 million users sign up in first five days\n\"There's no one entity who can say: 'Everybody has to read our ads, and everyone has to give us their data,' because we've got that distributed set of control. So it gives us more control over what we do,\" said Prodromou.\nThe fediverse is customizable, and users can follow or create their own instances that appeal to their interests and values, explained Brian Keegan, a computational social scientist with the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\"By joining different kinds of instances or moving your account between different kinds of instances, you're able to really vote or elect if this is the model of content, moderation and governance that I want to have around my social media.\"\u00a0\nThis creates an environment where users have more control of what they want to see and are less likely to be exposed to content like misinformation and hate speech seen on other platforms, Keegan said.\nMastodon, also seen as a competitor to Twitter, allows users to post updates and see what others are posting in their feed, much like other micro-blogging social platforms.\n \n(CBC )\nWith that control, however, the federated model can allow for people to fall into echo chambers, he said. \"There are probably some necessary social changes that we'll need to make on the fediverse in order to improve that.\"\nKeegan points out that if you do have a problem with something you're seeing, content moderation decisions are made by whoever is running the server that you're on. So you may have more success flagging a concern there compared to trying to appeal to an administrator working under the umbrella of a big tech company.\u00a0\nIs Meta welcome?\nBoth Prodromou and Keegan see Meta's potential move to the fediverse as an opportunity to grow and expand the space.\nIn addition to potentially making the interface less clunky and more user friendly, Keegan said a larger platform would bring more users to interact with.\n\"By having an organization like Meta express an interest, and building and scaling infrastructure and experiences and apps, that might allow for more people to join the fediverse,\" said Keegan.\u00a0\nCurrently, the fediverse has around 12 million users. By comparison, more than 100 million users signed up for Meta's Threads \nin the first five days of its launch\n.\nUnlike Meta and Twitter, led by Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk respectively, networks on the fediverse aren't typically run by a company or led by a CEO.\n \n(Manu Fernandez/The Associated Press)\nBut some fediverse users are set against a major tech company joining.\nKeegan said there's a movement of Mastodon users who have started an \"anti-Meta Fedi pact,\" pledging to block any instances owned by Meta.\n\"I think people see Meta coming in\u00a0and potentially this risk of them bringing this really poor track record, and destroying or deteriorating this really interesting and exciting space that's really been built from the bottom up by a lot of diverse, different kinds of communities,\" said Keegan.\nMeta hasn't said when Threads will join the fediverse and hasn't released details about what its presence will look like, beyond using the ActivityPub protocol so it can talk to other servers."},

The interim goals are more contentious.\u00a0\nThe federal government's 2030 targets would require the oil and gas sector to cut emissions 42 per cent below 2019 levels \u2014 a reduction so large the industry and province have called it a de facto production cap, and warned it isn't feasible without significant economic sacrifices.\nFederal environment minister says Alberta and Ottawa can come to terms on climate policy\nLast week, Guilbeault called for a global commitment to phase out \"unabated\" fossil fuels (oil and gas projects that don't rely on technology to capture their emissions). He's also leading the development of an impending emissions cap that could set limits at a total not seen since 1992.\nAnd the federal government is also about to release a plan to end billions in \n\"inefficient\" fossil fuel subsidies\n.\u00a0\nRecent budgets have \npromised billions\n in tax credits and other incentives for green technology like carbon capture\u00a0\u2014 spurred by the need to remain competitive with historic spending in the U.S. via the Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe minister's office noted \"frequent communication\" has happened between staff, officials and the oil and gas industry, including several meetings with Pathways in the past 18 months. Alberta and Ottawa have also agreed to a working group on energy matters.\n\"This includes how to align our investments in hydrogen, CCUS\u00a0(carbon capture, utilization and storage), SMRs\u00a0(small modular reactors) and to continue engagement on the upcoming oil and gas emissions cap and the Clean Electricity Regulations,\" Guilbeault's office said.\nThank you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CalgaryChamber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CalgaryChamber</a> CEO Deborah Yedlin for a productive meeting.

The federal government has set a timeline of 2035 for decarbonizing electricity production. While not directly tied to the oilsands, many producers have cogeneration plants that also produce electricity.\u00a0\nCanada's looming power problem is massive but not insurmountable: report\n\"I informed Minister Guilbeault that our government remains resolutely opposed to any federal cap on oil and gas emissions or electricity regulations that are not expressly consented to by Alberta,\" Schulz said in a statement.\u00a0\nAlberta has requested the government share its data and risk analyses on the impacts of 2035 and 2050 targets with the province.\nIn 2021, the oil and gas sector produced more than a quarter of Canada's total emissions.\u00a0By 2030, Ottawa wants to see an 81 megatonne reduction in annual oil and gas emissions. Pathways says 22 megatonnes is achievable.\u00a0"},

The protest ended\u00a0after the Trudeau government\u00a0\ninvoked the Emergencies Act\n.\nSeveral of the people associated with the \"Freedom Convoy\" who faced criminal charges have had at times chaotic court appearances, as many of the accused have rejected traditional legal conventions.\u00a0\nLast month one of the men facing charges for his role in the protests was charged and forcibly removed for illegally filming inside a courtroom.\nDuring the Public Order Emergency Commission held last year to examine the federal government's use of the Emergencies Act to end the protests, Barber attempted to distance himself from other organizers and stressed people attended the \"Freedom Convoy\" for many reasons.\u00a0\nBarber, who runs a trucking company in Swift Current, Sask., said at the time the group of protesters he arrived in Ottawa with were not associated with people inspired by what was happening in the capital\u00a0who blockaded border crossings across the country.\u00a0\nDuring her testimony at the commission, Lich said she was never directly told to leave Ottawa and said she felt instructions from police to do so were merely suggestions.\u00a0\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in Canadian history on Feb. 14 last year, arguing its temporary and extraordinary powers were needed to end blockades in Ottawa and at border crossings.\nLich and Barber were\u00a0arrested in Ottawa on Feb. 17, 2022 and their trials are expected to begin Sept. 5.\u00a0"},

At their farm near Saint-Eustache, Que., in the Laurentians \u2014 about 50 kilometres northwest of Montreal \u2014 they grow a variety of crops, including hay for horses.\nWhen the hay is freshly cut, it's soft and feathery, Karen says. \"That's what the horses really like. It's like candy to them.\"\u00a0\nOnce cut, the hay needs three days without rain to dry.\nNormally, the Robinsons would have cut their hay three weeks ago, but the bad weather has meant they have had to hold off on the first harvest. The hay, which had\u00a0grown unusually tall because of the extreme heat, has\u00a0folded\u00a0over on itself and now\u00a0lies in the puddles formed by\u00a0last week's torrential storms.\u00a0\nWith each passing day, the moisture degrades the crop.\nStill tallying the extent of the damage, the Robinsons estimate they have so far lost about half their crop sales, and the customers who want hay\u00a0to feed\u00a0their horses are left waiting.\u00a0But that is not the only loss. The rain has killed some of their soybean plants and washed away the seeds.\nThe\u00a0Robinsons are not alone.\nAs the harvest season continues to be marked by extreme weather, Quebec's farmers are struggling to cope with the impact it is having on their crops. Some are calling for insurance coverage that takes this new reality into account.\nRainstorm water has washed away soybean seeds and destroyed some of the plants on the Robinson farm.\n \n(Paula Dayan-Perez/CBC)\nInsured for climate change\n\"We've been doing it for a long, long time \u2026 So we know what we're doing. It's just Mother Nature is really changing now,\" said Karen Robinson.\nWhile the Robinsons' crops are insured with the \nFinanci\u00e8re agricole du Qu\u00e9bec\n\u00a0(FADQ) \u2014 the Crown corporation that serves as Quebec's sole insurance provider for farmers \u2014 they cannot recover all their losses, said Wayne Robinson.\nBerry farmers have also had to contend with challenging conditions: biting cold, drought and heavy rainfall \u2014 all within a single season.\nPart of this centuries-old Quebec farm has been swallowed, maybe permanently, by the river\nHow the storm's aftermath is taking its toll on some Montrealers\nSt\u00e9phanie Forcier, director at the\u00a0\nAssociation des producteurs de fraises et de framboises du Qu\u00e9bec\n, the association for Quebec strawberry and raspberry farmers, says the recent heavy rains have not only diminished\u00a0the quantity of fruit being harvested but have made\u00a0the berries taste watery too.\n\"It's really hard for the fruits and strawberries and especially raspberries. They are really fragile fruits,\" she said.\nForcier says farmers have already lost thousands of dollars, but what they fear most is more losses brought on by the spread of disease among the crops\nTo make matters worse, only about half of the berry farmers are insured with the FADQ.\nWater still pools in the hay fields of the Robinsons' farm days after heavy rainfall.\n \n(Paula Dayan-Perez/CBC)\n\"We know that this weather is going to be our 'new normal,' so we need to be more prepared. We need to have better insurance programs for the farmers.\"\nFarmers need the FADQ to make insurance coverage more affordable and comprehensive, says Forcier \u2014 or they will not be able to keep feeding Quebecers.\u00a0\nRight now, she says, farmers are forced to choose what kinds of extreme weather they can afford to get insured for, a situation she says no longer corresponds to the reality in which farmers face\u00a0a growing number and variety of\u00a0extreme weather events.\nSt\u00e9phanie Levasseur,\u00a0vice-president at the Quebec union for agricultural producers (UPA), has seen farmers of all types suffer as of late.\u00a0\n\"It's been a crazy year so far,\" said Levasseur.\nCleaning up after Montreal's storm: floods, fallen branches and power outages\n\"We had frost early this spring when the apples were in bloom \u2026 We've been having big droughts and really hot weather up north in the Abitibi and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. So hay and other crops up there are scarce,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, in the south of the province, vegetable fields have been flooded with rainwater and damaged by strong winds, preventing farmers from treating their crops for fungal diseases, she says.\nAltogether, Levasseur says the crop losses leave farmers in a difficult spot with their insurance premiums going up each time their harvests are devastated.\u00a0\n\"If we keep having these insane weather events that we haven't seen before, year after year, the whole system is not going to be able to withstand the pressure,\" she said.\u00a0\nIn a statement, the FADQ said it is \"sensitive\" to farmers' situations and is \"closely monitoring\u00a0 the situation in every region of Quebec.\"\nIt also said it regularly adapts its crop insurance program,\u00a0which covers yield reductions and certain specific costs\u00a0attributable to weather conditions and uncontrollable natural phenomena. The program will be overhauled over the next few years as part of the FADQ's digital transformation, it said, with agricultural producers being\u00a0consulted.\nTwo federal programs \u2014\u00a0AgriStability and\u00a0Agrinvest\u00a0\u2014 as well as the Agri-Qu\u00e9bec\u00a0program\u00a0are also available to\u00a0cover companies when production margins fluctuate, said the FADQ.\u00a0\n\"The FADQ provides agricultural businesses with income protection, insurance and financing products and services tailored to managing the risks inherent in this sector of activity,\" the FADQ told CBC.\u00a0"},

In the meantime, she said the borough has installed bollards as well as signage, and it has asked the local police precinct to increase its surveillance of the area.\n\"Everything is on the table right now,\" she said, adding the borough is also considering installing speed bumps, reversing the direction of traffic and removing parking on one side of the street.\nHowever, blocking access to commuters at Mont-Royal\u00a0and St-Hubert \u2014 as some residents have asked\u00a0\u2014 would mean removing parking on both sides of the street, impeding the ability of emergency responders to access the area, said Plourde."},

That's because most types of mosquitoes \"love water,\" and conditions in parts of the territory have been hot and dry instead.\u00a0\nIt's still early in the season, though, he said.\n\"If you could give me a crystal ball and tell me when it's going to rain, where and how much, then I can give you a summer [mosquito] forecast,\" said Stuart. Limited by available weather data however, Stuart said he can only predict the mosquito season for up to two weeks.\u00a0\nFor that time, he expects populations to remain below average across the territory.\u00a0\nMary Teya, an 85-year-old woman living in Fort McPherson, said her community has noticed a decline in mosquitoes and flies over the past 10 years.\nFurther north in Aklavik, Freddie Greenland painted a different picture.\u00a0\n\"There's lots of mosquitoes. Especially if you go out on the land. Out on the land, you're going to get billions,\" he said. \"It's good when we have a wind [that] keeps them away.\"\u00a0\nStuart, an independent contractor, helps the territory monitor and test mosquitoes for viruses in the Yellowknife and Dehcho regions. He said the insects are\u00a0water-dependent, and areas with more rain will see more mosquitoes.\u00a0\nHow will the changing climate affect mosquitoes?\nAlthough you might lump all mosquitoes together as\u00a0pesky nuisances,\u00a0Stuart said there are actually 2,500\u00a0species of mosquitoes globally \u2014 39 of which are present in the N.W.T.\u00a0\nNine of those species\n were discovered in the territory in the last ten years, he said, which could be a sign the changing climate is making conditions in the N.W.T. favourable for more types of mosquitoes.\u00a0\nOne of those new species is \nCulex tarsalis. \nStuart said it's \"sneaky biter\" that can \"carry just about any human transmissible disease\" including West Nile \u2014 but there aren't large numbers of that species in the N.W.T. yet.\nAs the climate continues to warm, Stuart said more mosquito species might move north. It could be a problem if those particular types of mosquitoes are able to carry harmful diseases.\u00a0\nClimate change could fuel increase in mosquito-borne viruses in N.W.T., say health officials\nThe urban mosquito is thriving farther north than it's ever been, and scientists are worried\nStill no\u00a0West Nile in the N.W.T.\nThe N.W.T. government says \nno mosquitoes from the N.W.T.\n have tested positive for malaria, West Nile or the Zika virus. Some have tested positive for California serogroup viruses, which include the Snowshoe hare and Jamestown Canyon viruses.\u00a0\nAlthough the territory says the risk of contracting a mosquito-borne virus is very low, Stuart urged people not to be complacent \u2014 even in places where it's hot and dry.\u00a0\n\"Don't assume you don't have the virus, always assume you might get it,\" he said.\u00a0\nStuart said bug repellant with DEET is the \"gold standard,\" but sprays with icaridin (also known as picaridin) work too. He said people can also wear light-coloured clothing and stay inside during\u00a0times mosquitoes are most active (dusk and dawn) to lower the risk of being bitten.\nHe said people can also dump, drain, fill and treat standing water on their properties to eliminate mosquito larvae.\u00a0\nWhat mosquitoes mean for biodiversity\nThough some countries are working to control mosquito populations, Stuart said he doubts a mosquito species could be completely eradicated in the N.W.T.\u00a0\nLike it or not, he said, they are a part of the territory's biodiversity.\u00a0\nThe Current\n9:17\nReleasing millions of modified mosquitos to fight dengue fever\nA Brazilian mosquito factory is planning to release 5 billion modified mosquitos a year to help combat dengue fever. We hear more from Scott O\u2019Neill, a microbiologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and CEO of the World Mosquito Program.\n\"They are food for other organisms. Dragonflies are my favourite, of course. They will feed on them in the water and in the air. Toads, birds, ducks \u2014 they will feed on the larvae,\" said Stuart, adding that if mosquitoes were to disappear \u2014 something else might take their place in the food chain.\u00a0\nBack in Fort McPherson, Teya said she's concerned about the changes she's seeing in her community: fewer mosquitoes and flies, fewer animals\u00a0and an abundance of flowers and plants.\u00a0\n\"I think people need to talk about these things. I think people need to talk about them and teach their children and grandchildren about how it used to be and how it is today.\"\u00a0"},

We know that even the numbers that we have are most likely not accurate.\"\nHomelessness rates\u00a0across the country are underreported, says Cheryl Forchuk, a homelessness expert with the Lawson Health Research Institute in London, Ont. It's challenging, she said, to get an accurate number of how many people are homeless\u00a0in a given area because\u00a0current tracking methods have an \"urban bias.\"\nCheryl Forchuck is a homelessness researcher with the Lawson Health Research Institute in London, Ont. She says tracking homelessness is challenging for many reasons, including an urban bias in current methods.\n \n(Tony Davis/CBC)\nMost areas across the country, she said, track homelessness using \"shelter\" or \"homeless\" data, which is the number of people availing of homeless shelters or who have used some type of homelessness service.\nForchuk says this method discounts many\u00a0living in rural areas, as they may not have the same access to shelters or services as those living in large, urban centres.\nShe also says a lot of homelessness is hidden, with many people couch surfing or\u00a0living in overcrowded housing.\n\"We often don't have a really good baseline because it's so hard to have accurate numbers of how many people are actually homeless,\" said Forchuk.\n\"Not everyone who's homeless wants to be found.\"\nUrban bias\nTracking homelessness in Newfoundland and Labrador is a patchwork effort, with numerous organizations across the province\u00a0working to get a snapshot of what homelessness looks like in a given region. There isn't one central system or method used by all\u00a0organizations, although some do share resources and data.\nFor instance, Katie VanKoughnet, a manager\u00a0at End Homelessness St. John's, says the organization oversees a database that is partly populated by its partner organizations in the community, such as the Gathering Place and Iris Kirby House.\u00a0\nShe says End Homelessness St. John's also conducts a point-in-time count \u2014\u00a0a snapshot of what homelessness looks like on a given day. She says the latest point-in-time count conducted on Nov. 24 revealed at least 183 people\u00a0experiencing homelessness on that day.\nBased on available data, which includes point-in-time counts, VanKoughnet said the \"conservative minimum estimate\" of the total number of people experiencing homelessness in the city in 2022 was 900 people.\nThe actual number\u00a0is likely higher, says VanKoughnet, but it's difficult to determine an\u00a0exact figure for numerous reasons. For instance, she says, individual situations are constantly changing, and many people in the city may not be able to access shelters or other services.\nKatie VanKoughnet of End Homelessness St. John\u2019s says at least 900 people experienced homelessness in St. John's last year.\n \n(Submitted by Katie VanKoughnet)\n\"Much of that increase in numbers is actually because we're getting better at finding people who should have been counted the whole time,\" said VanKoughnet.\n\"Knowing that people exist is the first step to getting them connected to resources.\"\nKim Beers, the chairperson of the Housing and Homelessness Hub in Gander, says housing organizations are often made aware of homelessness rates through community groups or word of mouth. She says there isn't a formal way of tracking individuals who don't access housing or shelter services.\n\"There's no one system right now that we all use,\" said Beers, \"but we're doing the best that we can to connect with each other.\"\nRace against time\nJarrar says the Nunatsiavut government\u00a0is one of the few entities trying to track and understand homelessness in Nunatsiavut and Happy Valley-Goose Bay, and that it staffs and runs all of the homeless shelters in both areas.\nShe says they're mandated to focus on the land claims area \u2014 which includes Nain, Hopedale, Makkovik, Postville and Rigolet \u2014 but that Nunatsiavut beneficiaries live across the province and the country, making tracking efforts a difficult undertaking.\nThe Nunatsiavut Housing Commission has completed two housing needs assessments in the last 10 years, where community liaison officers go door to door, trying to map the community as best they can, says Jarrar.\nA makeshift camp is shown in the wooded trails surrounding Happy Valley-Goose Bay in 2022. The camp was one of dozens in the wooded trails.\n \n(Danny Arsenault/CBC)\nShe says trying to collect data is\u00a0difficult due to human resource challenges, as well as the fact that the homeless population isn't relegated to community shelters\u00a0\u2014 homelessness often\u00a0comes in the form of overcrowded or inadequate housing, for instance.\nFor rural areas like northern Labrador, Jarrar and Forchuk say a vicious cycle emerges: because it's hard to gather accurate homeless data, it's difficult to receive the proper funding and resources necessary to address homelessness. And because there are few homelessness\u00a0resources, it's hard to gather data.\n\"Homelessness rates are astronomically higher than other parts of Canada, and there's almost no attention paid to it,\" said Jarrar.\nFence on George Street stage will impact downtown homeless population, says housing network\nShe couldn't find a rental in N.L. So she spent 2 years living in a 20-foot RV\nWhen asked whether there was a co-ordinated effort to track homelessness in the province, the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation said in an emailed statement it tracks the number of individuals provincewide who use an emergency shelter bed under the provincial emergency shelter program.\nOn June 27 this year,\u00a0317 people were using a shelter under the program, according to the statement.\nJarrar says the Nunatsiavut government isn't part of any provincial strategy or roundtable to address homelessness. She says communities across the province need assistance, and because of the hidden nature of homelessness, raising awareness is the first step to receiving help.\n\"It's a race against time,\" said Jarrar. \"I think it's a problem where you're often screaming for attention and there's not really enough to go around when there's such a crisis everywhere.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"},

Hydro said failing turnbuckles have led to outages at five towers since 2020.\nLast December, three broken turnbuckles\u00a0were discovered in remote sections of the Northern Peninsula and southern Labrador.\u00a0In each case, the damage took at least 10 days to repair.\nWhen a turnbuckle broke and a wire fell to the ground near Hampden, in the Long Range Mountains, snow had to be cleared from 72 kilometres of access roads before repairs could even begin.\nIn Newfoundland, 'commissioning' of troubled hydro dam met with skepticism, unease\nPlan focuses on most remote locations first\nHydro's four-year plan promises to replace turnbuckles \"in the highest risk and most remote areas [to] help reduce the duration of on outage in the event of a failure.\"\u00a0The most remote electrical towers are located about 100 kilometres away from the nearest regularly used roadway.\n\"The most remote areas are also where we are experiencing the most problems from galloping,\" noted\u00a0spokesperson Jill Pitcher in a statement, although she said galloping has occurred in central and southern Labrador, in the Long Range Mountains on the Northern Peninsula, as well as in eastern Newfoundland.\u00a0\nA number of connectors, known a turnbuckles, have failed along the Labrador-Island Link transmission line.\n \n(Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\"The failed turnbuckles were in remote, elevated areas affected by significant ice storms. Assets in these areas are generally more susceptible to damage,\" Pitcher wrote.\nHydro said each air flow spoiler costs about $173. Purchasing 9,000 of them will therefore cost around $1.6 million. However, once installation costs are factored in, a \"rough estimate\" from the\u00a0Crown corporation pegs the total cost of the repairs at about $100,000 per span.\nWith repairs slated for 161 spans, the total cost comes in at around $16\u00a0million, although Hydro spokesperson Sara Sullivan said Monday \"we anticipate the actual final cost will be less than the rough estimates.\"\nThe bill will not be covered by insurance given the new devices are an \"enhancement to the original design,\" Sullivan said.\nThe Muskrat Falls dam on Labrador\u2019s Churchill River last January.

It also continues to face difficulties resolving a series of intractable issues related to the synchronous condensers at the Soldier's Pond switchyard.\nThe project's price tag hit $13.5 billion in June. When the provincial government gave Muskrat Falls the green light in 2012, the total cost including financing was reported as $7.4 billion.\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"},

He tried fixing the problem on his own to no avail, and assumed it could be solved through a simple conversation with his provider, Bell Aliant.\nHe soon realized there wasn't an accessible way for him to communicate independently with the company. The experience was so troublesome, says King-Duke, that it led him to move back in with his mother at 27 years old.\n\"Right now, I feel like it took away my freedom. It took away my independence,\" says King-Duke, who uses a hearing aid and spoke to CBC News with the assistance of sign language interpreter Ken Parsons.\n \nThis N.L. woman lost her phone number.

But, he says, it shouldn't have taken weeks of failed communications to reach this point.\nAccessibility concerns\nKing-Duke says one of the most effective ways for those with hearing disabilities to communicate with companies like Bell is through live chat, where users type messages in real time with customer service representatives.\nHe soon realized customers in Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and P.E.I. don't\u00a0have the option to communicate via live chat to receive technical support or repairs for internet, Fibe TV or home phone issues.\nAccording to Bell's customer support website, all provinces and territories have a live chat option to solve mobility and satellite television issues. Quebec and Ontario have a live chat option for all mobility, internet, TV and home phone technical support issues.\nA screenshot of Bell Aliant's customer service options in Newfoundland and Labrador. King-Duke says there isn't a live chat option in the province for technical support or repairs for internet, Fibe TV and home phone issues.\n \n(Submitted by Adam King-Duke)\nKing-Duke says those with disabilities in Atlantic Canada are left behind. He says he tried calling the company, but had trouble understanding or communicating with representatives on the phone. He tried visiting Bell Aliant stores in St. John's, but they informed him they couldn't provide the technical support he needed.\nHe says he escalated the issue to Bell Aliant's customer relations centre, where he was then redirected to Bell's accessibility services centre, which the company touts as an \"industry-leading service\" designed for customers with accessibility needs.\nHe says nobody at\u00a0the centre could provide technical support, and that they redirected him to a phone call. After numerous emails, many of which he says received no response, his last resort was to have his mother translate a phone call for him. His services were fixed after five days of what he calls failed communication.\nHe says he appreciates his mother's help, but being unable to communicate independently is demoralizing.\n\"It's 2023,\" said King-Duke. \"Why not take advantage of it and use it? If you have it available for other provinces, why not take over that and use it here in Newfoundland or [the] Atlantic?\"\nAn ongoing problem\nMyles Murphy, the executive director of the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of the Deaf, advocates for the deaf community to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\nHe says many deaf people in the province face difficulties when trying to communicate with large, national corporations like Bell.\n\"It's really not fair,\" said Murphy through sign language interpreter\u00a0Parsons.\n\"Other provinces across the country have the full services and live chat for any of your services that you need. Deaf people always want to communicate, and the live chat feature would be something that would be perfect for us.\"\nMyles Murphy is the executive director of the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of the Deaf and is involved in numerous advocacy roles, including advocating for the deaf community to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). \n \n(Jessica Singer/CBC)\nAside\u00a0from live chat, King-Duke and Murphy say there are other communication options, but that they all come with their own set of roadblocks. For instance, requesting an in-store interpreter through Bell is a lengthy process, says King-Duke, and availability to those living outside Ontario and Quebec is limited.\nVideo relay service, also known as VRS, allows sign language users to communicate with others via telephone by connecting with an interpreter using video call, who then interprets for the user. Murphy says this is another common option for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, but that representatives with Bell often don't accept VRS calls due to challenges identifying the deaf customer.\nKing-Duke says he doesn't know how much longer he'll be living with his mother, in a home they rent together in Paradise, N.L.

In response, the office announced last week that it could no longer offer walk-in consultations.\n\"We do see a lot of people come to us in a sort of crisis,\" Hennessey said. \"And that's something that we're having trouble navigating because we're not an emergency service, and we don't really have the human resources to help people in such a timely manner.\"\nAnd while Canada has signed international treaties declaring food and housing as human rights, enforcing those rights is not part of the mandate of the Newfoundland and Labrador commission \u2014 even though everyone there wants to help, she said.\nAs in the rest of the country, people in Newfoundland and Labrador are struggling to afford food and find affordable places to live.\nThe province's largest food bank \u2014\u00a0Bridges to Hope in St. John's \u2014\u00a0has said demand is higher than it's ever been, particularly among people who work full time. And the wait-list for a spot in government-run housing grew by 21 per cent this spring from the year before, jumping from 2,068 people on April 19, 2022, to 2,493 people as of April 28, according to the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation.\n\"People need shelter, they're not able to get shelter. People need food, they're not able to afford it,\" Hennessey said of those arriving at the office looking for help.\nPandemic has exacerbated food and housing insecurity\nNewfoundland and Labrador's Human Rights Act protects people who have been denied housing because of discrimination based on certain prohibited grounds, including race, nationality and gender identity. It doesn't cover those who can't afford food or housing. That means they can't file a case with the commission, whose staff nonetheless do what they can to help, Hennessey said.\nTasha Stansbury, a PhD student at the University of Ottawa's law faculty, says Canada hasn't succeeded in ensuring the rights to food and housing can be enforced.\n\"There's a law that says everybody has a right to housing, but there's no law that says if people are unhoused, the government must house them,\" Stansbury said in an interview.\nThe people knocking on the door of the Newfoundland and Labrador Human Rights Commission are another signal that the federal government needs to do more to live up to its commitment to uphold people's rights to housing and food, Stansbury said.\n\"COVID-19 caused huge, huge, huge amounts of food and housing insecurity, and we haven't really recovered from that,\" she said.\n\"The further you get from food and housing security, the harder it is to climb back.\"\nOttawa's decision in February 2022 to appoint a federal housing advocate \u2014\u00a0Marie-Josee Houle \u2014\u00a0was a step forward, she said.

She said the small staff felt they weren't able to provide walk-in clients with the level of trauma-informed care they would like to offer, as they also juggled scheduled appointments and a case backlog dating back to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNot being able to help people takes an emotional toll, she added.\n\"It's been difficult not being able to support people through a complaint process or pre-complaint process, because we just don't have the jurisdiction to do so.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"},

She made a decision to move as a result this week, and\u00a0signed a lease for a place she can afford.\n\"None of us could have expected the significant difference in the cost of our oil over the last year. I think it was shocking to all of us even though we anticipated that it wasn't going to remain the same,\" she said.\nPrice of home heating oil in N.L. will skyrocket with federal carbon tax, says finance minister\nBrace your bank accounts. Here's how your taxes and power bills are going up\n\"And to hear that it's going to continue to grow, it just made staying here completely unsustainable for us.\"\nThe implementation of the federal carbon tax is set to dramatically increase the price of home heating fuels in Newfoundland and Labrador.\nOil tanks like this one have become more expensive to fill after the federal government's new carbon pricing benchmark kicked in.\n \n(Jeremy Eaton/CBC)\nSpeaking with CBC News in June, Finance Minister Siobhan Coady said the tax will raise the price of furnace oil by17 cents per litre \u2014 and by\u00a045 cents per litre by 2030.\nSheppard says that number terrifies her, and was a key factor in her decision to seek more affordable housing.\n\"It's really discouraging when you're an adult who\u00a0should be financially stable in the situation\u00a0that they're in, and they're in a situation where they're renting with two other people \u2014\u00a0splitting utilities, splitting rent \u2014 and still unsure if they can make it work,\" she said.\n\"You factor in all these expenses skyrocketing, it just feels like such an impossible situation.\"\n'It's really slim pickings'\nSheppard knows that her struggle, as someone with a roof over her head and a good career, signals a greater impact on\u00a0those on lower-level or fixed incomes.\nJade Kearley, a board member of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing and Homelessness Network in Corner Brook, says she's heard of many suffering due to the ballooning cost of living.\n\"We had a lot of individuals that have reached out and said [they're] unable to pay the minimum amount that is needed to get ... the oil refuelled in their tank,\" Kearley said earlier this month.\n\"They're having to stretch their dollars even further. The cost of oil of course [is] going up, and that means that then they are not having as much money to pay for groceries or extracurricular activities.\"\nJade Kearley is a member of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing and Homelessness Network in Corner Brook.\n \n(Alex Kennedy/CBC)\nA study done by the network using data gathered from early 2020 to April 2022\u00a0listed the average rent in the Corner Brook area at $776 a month\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and nearly $1,000 a month when accounting for utilities.\nThat figure has since risen, Kearley said, and is paired with an incredibly tough market when it comes to available rentals.\n\"It's really slim pickings at the moment. If you have decent income you have a better chance, but at the same time ... the minimum is $1,000, $1,200. There was a three-bedroom house for $2,200 a month.\" she said.\nMinimum wage earners in N.L. can't afford rent, report says\nThe Newfoundland and Labrador government has offered incentives for homeowners to make the switch from oil to electric heating.\nHowever, Kearley says\u00a0it isn't designed to help landlords and tenants due to the fact that it's only available to those who own their home.\nLandlords also aren't the ones paying the utility bill, Kearley added, which likely doesn't offer an incentive to undertake the change.\n\"For landlords that have multiple units, there's probably no incentive for them to want to make it better for their tenants,\" she said.\nTake Charge Newfoundland and Labrador and the provincial government have introduced incentives for homeowners to transition from oil to electric heating, but it's only available to people who own their own home. \n \n(takechargenl.ca)\nBoth Kearley and Sheppard say the increase in the cost of heating and the cost of living highlights the need for more affordable housing in the province, and say government needs to make more of a commitment to it.\n\"All I know is that people really need homes, and they need affordable homes. They need to be able to have a roof over their head and not worry about whether or not their pipes are going to freeze in the wintertime,\" Sheppard said.\n\"While I agree that we should be moving away from oil \u2026 I don't think the burden of\u00a0that should be on low-income and lower middle class people. I don't think they should have to foot the bill for that transition.\"\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador"},

That has a lot of consequences.\"\nThose effects include changes to pest and tree environments, the condition of ground cover and sea ice melt.\u00a0\nMelting sea ice is the biggest noticeable shift, Finnis said, adding that has been raising alarms for him for a long time.\n\"That sea ice is disappearing in the Labrador sea relatively quickly and, frankly, across the entire Arctic sea ice loss is well ahead of schedule, relative to what climate models said we should be expecting,\" he said.\n\"We're talking decades of where we thought it would be, and that leaves us recognizing that some parts of the environment and climate system, and earth system overall, are changing faster than we're anticipating, which really should ... sound\u00a0alarm bells for us in terms of other changes, too.\"\nClimatologist Joel Finnis says it's time to reevaluate how we live in cities built for the cold.  \n \n(Jeremy Eaton/CBC)\nExtreme weather events are becoming more common in Newfoundland and Labrador.\nFinnis points to Hurricane Fiona, which decimated communities along the southwest coast of Newfoundland in September, along with heavy rain on snow events witnessed on the west coast that caused severe and sudden flooding.\u00a0\n\"It's things like those high wind events, it's things like those heavy precipitation events, those rain or\u00a0snow events as well, that I think are going to have a bigger impact on us overall than some of these heat waves,\" he said.\nThat's not to say the province shouldn't prepare for future heat.\u00a0\nFinnis said high temperatures, like those experienced this week, should tell us we need to think about how we operate in our environment, cities and workplaces.\n\"We can't live and work in the cities that we've built for a cold environment in the same way if we're starting to hit long stretches of hot weather,\" he said.\n\"We need to adjust our activities.

Once at the morgue, the body is picked up by Qikiqtani Funeral Services.\nVeevee said she spoke to the owner of Qikiqtani Funeral Services, Jake Gebara, and was told the morgue had been overcrowded at the time.\nIn an interview, Gebara said there were a lot of bodies at the hospital morgue when the mistake happened. There is supposed to be one bed per individual, but there were so many at the time that they were \"bunched up together.\"\nJake Gebara, the owner of Qikiqtani Funeral Services, says an overcrowded morgue in Iqaluit may have led to the wrong body being sent to Pangnirtung.\n \n(David Gunn/CBC)\nHe said he isn't sure how the bodies got switched, but name tags and stickers can fall off, and may have fallen onto the wrong bodies.\n\"What can I say to the family? The damage has already been done.

I am deeply, deeply, deeply upset, too,\" he said.\nGebara said the funeral service is looking to modernize its systems to avoid any future mistakes.

People as far away as Anchorage also received\u00a0tsunami alerts on their phones, though they were not at risk of a\u00a0tsunami, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\nA warning issued late Saturday by the National Tsunami Warning\u00a0Center covered an area about 64 kilometres southwest of\u00a0Homer to an area about 128.7 kilometres\u00a0northeast of\u00a0Unalaska. It was later downgraded to an advisory and then canceled.\u00a0\nEmergency managers and tsunami scientists said they were\u00a0following their systems, which err on the side of caution and speed.\u00a0But others worry that confusion around whether the tsunami posed an\u00a0actual danger could erode public trust in the warning system.\n\"This is our concern: We're going to have a cry-wolf situation\u00a0where people aren't going to respond to the warning anymore and they\u00a0just won't evacuate,\" said Mark Robl, the police chief in Homer,\u00a0who said dispatchers there received \"hundreds of phone calls an\u00a0hour\" after the warning was issued.\nA large earthquake can trigger a release of energy that can lead\u00a0to a destructive wave. When sensitive instruments pick up such an\u00a0event, an automated alert goes out. But there's no time to\u00a0immediately verify if such a wave is forming, said James Gridley,\u00a0director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer.\n\"We issue a warning right away because we need to get anybody in\u00a0the immediate area out of danger right away,\" he said.\nThen scientists with the center review data from buoys and other\u00a0instruments to determine whether a wave is forming, and what size it\u00a0is, Gridley said. Warnings are revised or cancelled, though that part\u00a0of the response can take about an hour, he said.\nAlerts from the center also can trigger localized emergency\u00a0responses, such as the sounding of sirens urging residents to seek\u00a0higher ground.\nThe Kenai Peninsula Borough sounded its tsunami warning sirens,\u00a0emergency manager Brenda Ahlberg said. Many in the region also\u00a0received cellphone notifications. Wireless Emergency Alerts are sent\u00a0to anyone in a geographic area of certain cellphone towers in zones\u00a0that can be widely defined\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which is why people in Anchorage\u00a0received notifications.\nWhile the alerts are a way to reach people quickly, broad\u00a0notification areas can mean people get alerts when they don't need\u00a0them. Gridley said efforts were ongoing to better hone the system.\u00a0\nThe Kenai Peninsula Borough currently can only deploy its sirens\u00a0systemwide, but it plans to install soon a new tsunami siren system\u00a0that will allow for precise, community-by-community warnings,\u00a0Ahlberg said.\n\"Is it unfortunate that they have been false alarms, or is it\u00a0fortunate that we have been able to deploy the system, get people\u00a0out of harm's way, and then realize it wasn't necessary?\" she\u00a0asked."},

slowing down an already cumbersome process.\u00a0\nThe LMIA is meant to prove that no Canadian is available to do the job, but Yukon and some provinces in Atlantic Canada have been granted LMIA exemptions in hiring workers from abroad and the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce says the Northwest Territories should be granted the same.\u00a0\nMark Henry is the co-owner of the Copperhouse

labour shortages.\u00a0\nHe said\u00a0since the process is so lengthy, the restaurant has developed a sort of pipeline philosophy to ensure they've recruited and processed individuals who\u00a0are available to come when a position opens.\nThe entire process \u2014 from posting a job ad, completing an LMIA, and bringing over an employee from abroad \u2014 can take up to a year, Henry said,

the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce, says hiring foreign workers is essential to staffing Yellowknife businesses and the territory should press the federal government to streamline the hiring process.\u00a0\n\"Employers would love to hire someone local from Yellowknife or someone within the N.W.T., and certainly a Canadian willing to relocate to our beautiful city, but they're just not there,\" she said. \"So we've identified immigration as one area where we can help address labour shortages.\"\n'So frustrating'\nPetter Jacobsen has been through the process of obtaining his work

two to three months, but after waiting 11 months \u2014 five of them succeeding the expiry of his visa \u2014 Jacobsen says it was like sending his application into a black hole.\u00a0\n\"It just becomes so frustrating,\" he said.\u00a0\nDespite sending his application six months before his visa expired, the five months between its expiration and his renewal left him without a valid drivers licence and health card, though since Jacobsen\u00a0received implied status\u00a0\u2014 sometimes offered to foreign nationals while applications are processing\u00a0\u2014 the delay did not impact his work.\u00a0 \nAfter reading\u00a0\nsimilar stories\n, Jacobsen said he knew his experience was not a one-off.

The uninhabited island is in Nunavut's Qikiqtaaluk region\u00a0and has conditions similar to the red planet.\nUnder the 24-hour midnight sun, they plan to study super-salty\u00a0cold springs that release methane on Gypsum Hill, about a 45-minute\u00a0hike from the research station. They also plan to take methane\u00a0readings from the atmosphere and carry out a simulated Mars Rover\u00a0mission.\n\"Methane is a really important atmospheric gas here on Earth\u00a0because it contributes significantly to global warming,\" said\u00a0Sapers, a visiting scientist with the California Institute of\u00a0Technology. \"It's also a really interesting gas on Mars and we\u00a0don't understand exactly where it's coming from or where it's\u00a0disappearing to.\"\nOn Earth, Sapers said, most methane is biogenic, meaning it's\u00a0produced by living organisms. The gas can also be produced by\u00a0geological processes.\nIts presence on Mars could be evidence of past or present life,\u00a0or indicate areas on the planet that could be inhabited in the\u00a0future.\nScientists first detected trace amounts of methane in the Mars\u00a0atmosphere in 2003 and have continued to be perplexed by it.\nSapers said an instrument on the Curiousity rover has to take\u00a0samples from the Martian atmosphere over several hours to enrich\u00a0methane to where it can be analyzed.

She said they want to determine whether those\u00a0micro-organisms oxidize methane, like those she has studied in deep\u00a0ocean methane seeps.\n\"Understanding more about these micro-organisms up in the Arctic\u00a0might help us understand the potential for micro-organisms to\u00a0prevent significant amounts of methane from being released in the\u00a0subsurface of the Arctic,\" she said.\n\"That would be really\u00a0important, especially in the context of climate change and global\u00a0warming.\"\nHow Canadian scientists are turning to the Arctic in the hope of finding life on Mars\nCanadian Arctic once home to vibrant forests, ancient fossils show\nSapers said the polar desert island is the ideal place to do this\u00a0research as it is the only place on Earth where hyper-saline cold\u00a0springs that are methane seeps are situated in permafrost \u2014\u00a0similar\u00a0to subsurface conditions on Mars.\nThe planet and island also both have cold and dry conditions, she\u00a0said, and polygonal terrain \u2014\u00a0a type of patterned ground that forms\u00a0in permafrost regions on Earth by freezing and thawing.\u00a0\n\"It is wonderful to be up here,\" she said. \"It is a very\u00a0exciting place to do research.\"\nThis story was produced with the financial assistance of the Meta\u00a0and Canadian Press News Fellowship, which is not involved in the editorial process.\u00a0"},

Any information that could contain personal information is only released under the freedom-of-information process.\nAsked whether Service Nova Scotia plans to proactively publish its data, Boomer said that hasn't yet been decided.\nNon-profits collecting data\nHussey said she and others who work on issues related to housing and homelessness currently rely primarily on statistics gleaned by local non-profit organizations, such as those \npublished by the Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia\n, or numbers published by Statistics Canada and the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, but Hussey said\u00a0\"provincially, we don't really see a lot.\"\nDalhousie Legal Aid Service itself has started tracking information from its clients about 10 months ago\n\"It provides us with a good snapshot of who is\u00a0accessing our services and it allows us to be able to\u00a0quantify some of the trends that we've known anecdotally were happening.\"\nBut even that has its limitations. The organization primarily serves the Halifax Regional Municipality, so it doesn't have a clear picture of what's happening across the entire province.\n\"That's a\u00a0real significant gap and I think the government is in the best position to actually be collecting that information.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES\nEndangered right whale movements 'totally different' in Gulf of St. Lawrence in 2023\nScenes from the North American Indigenous Games in Halifax\nVideo\nCultural village at North American Indigenous Games showcasing more than just athletics\nNova Scotia Health and IWK hiring 8 Mi'kmaw patient navigators\nHer obituary requested donations to an abortion clinic.

The party advocates for reducing taxes, allowing private health care and more choice in education, and it's been vocal about COVID-19 protocols.\nThe three main parties have not done enough through the years to help the community, said Taylor. He points to a lack of development in the area, challenges with affordable housing and food security, and \nissues related to historical titles to land\n that have only recently started to be resolved.\nNot being tied to the traditional party structure would be an asset if he is elected, said Taylor.\n\"None of these other people that are running can stand for the people, they have to stand behind their party,\" he said.\n\"So if the party doesn't agree with what the people say, they have to toe the line.

It is also\u00a0partnering with Membertou to purchase wind power from two of the band's proposed farms, the 20-turbine \nKmtnuk\u00a0project\n\u00a0and the 15-turbine \nBear Lake project\n.\n\"This investment helps Nova Scotia move more quickly and cost-effectively towards its clean energy transition,\" said EverWind\u00a0CEO Trent Vichie in a news release.\n\"The power generated at these three new developments will also ensure EverWind's green hydrogen and ammonia will meet the strictest international standards for green fuels.\u2026\u00a0It is a win for our project, a win for the province and, ultimately, a win for the planet.\"\nEverWind\u00a0wants to harness renewable energy and use that power to separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water drawn from Landrie Lake. The hydrogen will then be captured and converted to ammonia so it can be shipped to customers who can use it to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\nWindy Ridge\nIf approved, the Windy Ridge wind farm would produce up to 340 megawatts\u00a0from 66 turbines located in the area of East Folly Mountain in Colchester County. The power would be transmitted from the wind farm to Point Tupper through Nova Scotia Power's grid.\nEverWind said\u00a0it plans to submit its environmental assessment to the province later this year and build\u00a0the $660-million wind farm by 2025.\nKmtnuk\nThe Kmtnuk wind power project would see 98 megawatts\u00a0of power produced by 20 turbines located near McCallum Settlement in Colchester County.\nEnvironmental studies and an assessment are expected to be completed before the end of this year, and construction on the $190-million project would take place between late 2024 and late 2025.\nBear Lake\nThe Bear Lake development is expected to generate up to 89 megawatts\u00a0from 15 turbines located near Smiths Corner in Hants County.\u00a0\nThe timeline for the $170-million project is similar to the other two, with the environmental assessment expected to be completed this year and construction to take place between late 2024 and late 2025.\nMembertou First Nation owns 51 per cent of both the Kmtnuk and Bear Lake wind farms, with the remaining percentage owned by EverWind.\nChief Terry Paul said he's excited to see the first turbine go up.\n\"It takes us a further step toward getting off fossil fuels,\" he said. \"We're really proud for Membertou to be part of the leading edge on our transition to green energy.\"\nWind farms expected to\u00a0meet project's energy needs\nIn total, the three wind projects will generate approximately 530 megawatts, enough power to operate the EverWind hydrogen and ammonia project,\u00a0plus possibly extra to feed into Nova Scotia Power's electricity grid, said Vichie.\nThe company is also still planning to erect about 300 turbines in Guysborough County during a later phase of the project, which will feed directly into the hydrogen facility.\nCBC Explains\nWhat is green hydrogen, and how green is it, anyway?\nNova Scotia researchers helping to fill in pieces of green-hydrogen puzzle\nSolar power will now comprise part of the energy source for the hydrogen project, too, Vichie said.\u00a0The company plans to build a 300-megawatt\u00a0solar farm next to the hydrogen production plant.\n\"The wind resource in Nova Scotia\u00a0is\u00a0windier in the wintertime and\u00a0less so in the summer,\u00a0and so solar actually is a very nice complement for a portion of\u00a0the power. As we developed our plans ...\u00a0that became more and more apparent to us,\" he said.\nThe company said\u00a0the wind projects alone will create 650 construction jobs and 30 full-time positions.\nEverWind\u00a0plans to start producing hydrogen at the former NuStar oil and gas storage facility in Point Tupper, N.S., starting in 2025.\n \n(EverWind)\nEverWind claims uptick in interest\nVichie said the European Commission\u00a0recently developed a regulatory framework for hydrogen produced from renewable energy, and that clarity has sparked a bump in interest in EverWind's project \"from some of the largest players in the world.\"\nThe company is also working to develop customers for its products here at home.\nAnother company has pitched a\u00a0separate green hydrogen project for the Point Tupper area. \nBear Head Energy\n plans to use \nwater from the same lake\n as EverWind to produce hydrogen and ammonia.\nBoth Bear Head's and EverWind's\u00a0hydrogen projects have already \nreceived approval\n from the environment minister.\nLand clearing has already begun for the hydrogen and ammonia facility, Vichie said.\nMORE TOP STORIES\u00a0\nFamily running Dartmouth convenience store eyes development with affordable units\nBusinesses around Halifax's Spring Garden Road hope end is in sight for streetscaping project\nHalifax police supervisor 'shocked' that clothing was not collected in rape case\nSister of Cape Breton man missing for 30 years hopeful amid new search by police\nPin trading has become an unofficial sport at NAIG.

Stephen McCormack testified Wednesday before the Nova Scotia Police Review Board in response to a complaint from Carrie Low, who alleges police mishandled her 2018 sexual assault case.\nLow reported being abducted and raped in the suburb of East Preston on the night of May 18, 2018. She has testified that the following day, Halifax police Const. Bojan Novakovic interviewed her at a local hospital, sent her home and told her the clothing would be collected that evening.\nMcCormack, who at the time was a supervisor in the sexual assault unit, said he only learned of this on May 29, 2018, when he returned from vacation and responded to Low's complaint about the potentially valuable evidence still sitting on a bookshelf at her parent's home.\n\"I was a little shocked that she was still in possession of it [the clothing]\u00a0and a little shocked she was given exhibit bags in order to put items in herself and call for them to be picked up,\" he testified.\nHalifax Regional Police Const. Bojan Novakovic was docked eight hours of pay for his role in the Low investigation.\n \n(Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press)\nThe review board hearing has heard that DNA evidence can degrade if it's not refrigerated and is open to tampering if left unsecured for days.\nThe evidence was eventually tested by a lab, and the DNA found on it in October 2019 was linked to Alexander Thomas, who was charged with sexual assault in 2020. \nHowever, Thomas died before his trial, in what police described as a homicide unrelated to the Low case.\nMcCormack testified that he emailed Novakovic's supervisor in the patrol division on May 29, 2018, and expressed his concerns about the handling of the evidence.\n\"I received an email back, after his supervisor spoke to him about it, and he [Novakovic]\u00a0was extremely apologetic about it, and [Novakovic] acknowledged he had made a mistake and rectified the issue right away,\" McCormack told the review board.\nNovakovic went through an internal disciplinary process after Low formally complained in May 2019, and his supervisors determined that he was \"in neglect of duty\" by not seizing the clothing more promptly.\nThey also found he should have reported the location of the alleged rape to a supervisor to determine if officers would be sent to secure the scene and ensure evidence was preserved.\nNo search warrant\nThe board has heard that Low provided the police with the exact location of her alleged rape on May 20, 2018, and told them that her shoe and panties were still there, but police didn't apply for a search warrant or secure the scene.\nNovakovic was docked eight hours of pay for his role in the matter.\nLow has appealed the disciplinary decision in Novakovic's case, and she is seeking wider recommendations from the review board on how the Halifax police handle sexual assault complaints.\nNovakovic is expected to testify before the board on Thursday before final submissions are made by the parties.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nSister of Cape Breton man missing for 30 years hopeful amid new search by police\nFamilies sue U.S. manufacturer over helicopter crash that killed 6 Canadian military members\nPin trading has become an unofficial sport at NAIG.

Transgender Network\nMacPherson added that the decision to do away with the women's event entirely is hard to understand, given that competitive fairness is being cited.\n\"So much of the arguments around excluding trans women is to protect women's sport. But in this case, they're completely removing all women. So how do you protect women's sport by removing the women entirely, let alone just the trans women?\" MacPherson said.\n\"It's very much saying, 'This sport is not inclusive of anyone but cis men.'

Journalists are using access to information laws, and in some cases court challenges, to obtain discipline records and data.\nA Charlottetown police officer was accused of using \"humiliating language\" toward a person who said they'd been administered a drug without their knowledge in a bar. The complaint also said the officer failed to investigate whether a crime actually happened.\nAn investigation found \"clear and convincing evidence to support the allegation of misconduct,\" but the officer resigned, and Charlottetown's police chief no longer had any jurisdiction to discipline them.\nIn another case, a complainant alleged a Charlottetown officer neglected their duties and acted in a discreditable manner.\u00a0\nThe officer saw their rank reduced for six months, but it's not exactly clear what kind of behaviour and negligence led to them being disciplined.\nThose are two of the gaps CBC\u00a0News found when analyzing more than three years' worth of municipal police complaints held by the Office of the Police Commissioner of P.E.I.\n'Clear and convincing evidence' Charlottetown cop violated code of conduct during drink spiking investigation\nThe data includes\u00a0more than 50 complaints made about police officers in Charlottetown, Summerside and Kensington between 2019 and the end of 2022. It shows that about 10 per cent of the complaints \u2014 six in total \u2014 were founded or substantiated.\u00a0\nP.E.I. is unique in Atlantic Canada because its police commission posts summaries of all complaints online. That's\u00a0information \nCBC has had to go to court for\u00a0in other provinces\n.\n'We have very clear boundaries around what our role and responsibility is. If there was a desire to expand that, that would be a political decision as opposed to a decision from this office,' says P.E.I. police commissioner Cindy Wedge. \n \n(Brittany Spencer/CBC)\nBut the summaries have varying levels of detail. Any identifying specifics about the officer are excluded, and in some cases\u00a0the summaries don't identify the police service the officer belongs to \u2014\u00a0information the police commission could still withhold moving forward.\n\"I fully appreciate that there is a very strong public interest in policing and civilian oversight agencies, so we aim to be as transparent as possible while always protecting people's privacy rights,\" said P.E.I. police commissioner Cindy Wedge.\u00a0\n\"It's a balance. It's why we're going to change publishing the name of the police agency that employs the officer complained of, because we think we can do a better job of protecting people's privacy.\"\nCompiling the data\u00a0 \nOf the six complaints that were founded, at least three were about officers with the Charlottetown Police. The summary of the other three\u00a0didn't specify which police agency they were\u00a0against.\u00a0\n \n(Nicole Williams/CBC)\nPolice officers in Atlantic Canada are the subject of hundreds of complaints each year.\u00a0\nThe complaints\u00a0come from members of the public and internal sources within the officer's own police department.\nAllegations may relate to\u00a0neglect of duty, excessive force or deceitful behaviour, to name a few examples.\u00a0\nCBC Investigates\nCBC project reveals never-before-seen details of allegations of police wrongdoing\nThe CBC's Atlantic investigative unit has launched a project called Police and Public Trust, which will take Canadians inside the opaque systems of police complaints and discipline across the region.\nIn P.E.I., the complaints were gathered from the police commission's website and from conversations with commission staff, who determined some had been missing from the site following CBC inquiries.\n\"We noted some gaps that we've now gone back into our online records and rectified,\" Wedge said.\u00a0\n\"So it's something that we're always open to looking at, how can we improve this.\"\nMost complaints unfounded\nThe majority of complaints \u2014\u00a0about 52 per cent \u2014\u00a0were unfounded or unsubstantiated. The rest were either dismissed, abandoned or ineligible,\u00a0typically because the complainant could no longer be reached or because they were made\u00a0against the RCMP, which has a separate system to handle complaints.\u00a0\nOf the six that were founded, at least three were about officers with the Charlottetown police. The summary of the other three\u00a0didn't specify which police agency they were\u00a0against.\u00a0\nIn four of them, the resolution offered was an apology to the complainant. A founded complaint resulted in an officer getting their rank reduced\u00a0and not being allowed in any\u00a0supervising position for six months.\nThe final founded complaint resulted in disciplinary action being taken, but there aren't details about what that was.\nWhen it comes to the nature of the complaints filed, the most frequent allegation is that an\u00a0officer neglected their duty. That\u00a0includes claims\u00a0that an\u00a0officer failed to investigate a situation or lay a charge.\u00a0\nAlso frequent are allegations of\u00a0discreditable conduct, such as harassment, threats, being rude or aggressive, or using humiliating language toward the complainant.\u00a0\nOther complaints relate to\u00a0investigative decisions the complainant disagreed with, allegations of abuse of authority or excessive use of force, and claims of\u00a0deceitful behaviour, like lying or providing false information.\u00a0\nPolice Act spells out how complaints are investigated\nThe province's first police commissioner was appointed in 2009, making the P.E.I. office the newest\u00a0of its kind in the Maritimes.\u00a0\nThe complaint process is outlined in the province's Police Act, which sets out when they can be filed, how they're investigated, and who decides whether a complaint is founded.\u00a0\nPeople can file complaints directly to the police commission or\u00a0one of the three municipal police agencies. Complaints need to be made in writing and\u00a0include the complainant's name, contact information and identify the officer or police agency the complaint is against.\nComplainants\u00a0also need\u00a0to\u00a0provide the date of the incident, a description of what happened and their signature.\nPeople can file one through the police commissioner's website, which will prompt them for all the required information.\n'We live in a world of increased transparency, but we also work within the framework and the legislation that was set out for us. And the Police Act kind of lays out the steps,' says Charlottetown police chief Brad MacConnell.\n \n(Brittany Spencer/CBC)\nUnder the act, investigations are initially done by the police service the complaint was filed against.\u00a0Charlottetown police chief Brad MacConnell said that is\u00a0unless the complaint involves serious or criminal allegations.\nIn such cases, MacConnell said, the attorney general can assign an independent investigator, like another police service or the Serious Incident Response Team in Nova Scotia.\u00a0\nChief decides if claim is unfounded\nIn Charlottetown, the investigations are done by a senior officer who then writes a report for the chief of police. It's the chief\u00a0who decides whether a complaint is founded.\u00a0\nBut the report isn't given to the complainant unless they make a\u00a0freedom of information request. The police commissioner will be given a copy of the full report if they get a request to review the investigation.\u00a0\n \nI think anything we can do to improve that transparency, certainly we're open for discussion on that.\n-\u00a0Brad MacConnell, Charlottetown police chief\n\"We live in a world of increased transparency, but we also work within the framework and the legislation that was set out for us. And the Police Act kind of lays out the steps,\" MacConnell said.\n\"Certainly as chief I'm very mindful of serious incidents that can undermine public confidence and the need for transparency, where other agencies have to come in and make sure that there's transparency and investigation.\n\"I think anything we can do to improve that transparency, certainly we're open for discussion on that.\"\nCBC Investigates\nHow freedom of information laws help crack 'culture of secrecy' on police accountability\nCBC Investigates\nWhat these previously unreleased police discipline files show about conduct at the RNC\nIf a complainant, or the officer the complaint is filed against, doesn't agree with the outcome of the investigation they can request the police commissioner conduct a review to see if anything was missed.\u00a0\nEight reviews were done between 2019 and the end of 2022, according to the police commissioner's website. In all reviews, the police chief's initial decision was upheld.\u00a0 \nNo way to tell if officers face multiple complaints\nWhile the police commissioner provides summaries and outcomes about complaints online, there are still many things that aren't made public.\u00a0\nSince there's no information to identify an officer, there's no way to know if someone has been the subject of multiple complaints.\u00a0\nIn the data provided to CBC through access to information in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, police officers were assigned a unique code that allows records to show whether someone has multiple complaints against them.\u00a0\n \nIf there was any sign that there was kind of a consistent problem, we would know the avenues to follow to address that.\n- Cindy Wedge, P.E.I. police commissioner\nOn P.E.I., Wedge said she doesn't think this system is necessary because of the small size of the Island's police services.\u00a0\n\"We know who the people are that have been complained about,\" she said. \"If there was any sign that there was kind of a consistent problem, we would know the avenues to follow to address that.\"\u00a0\nThe police commissioner's powers are also limited by what's laid out in the Police Act. For example, Wedge\u00a0can't carry out larger, systemic investigations into police complaints to try to identify any trends or patterns.\u00a0\n\"We have very clear boundaries around what our role and responsibility is,\" she said. \"If there was a desire to expand that, that would be a political decision as opposed to a decision from this office.\"\nProvince to take closer look at data\nBrody Connolly, P.E.I.'s director of public safety, says the province recently hired someone who will be doing data analysis for the department. That includes looking into information about police complaints.\n \n(Brittany Spencer/CBC)\nThe P.E.I.\u00a0Department of Justice and Public Safety says\u00a0the Police Act does give the justice minister and the attorney general broad oversight\u00a0that can be used to request an investigation.\nThe department said that should a\u00a0broader investigation be needed, the minister or\u00a0cabinet can request the police commissioner conduct such a review.\nThe province is\u00a0also taking steps to better understand the nature of complaints made against P.E.I. police officers.\nP.E.I's director of public safety, Brody Connolly, said the department receives annual reports from the police commissioner, but that there's a need to better analyze that information.\n \nWe're going to start getting into that a little bit deeper, trying to find some trends ...\u00a0so we can address any issues that we may see.\n-\u00a0Brody Connolly, director of public safety\nConnolly said a person was hired in the last two months who will be doing data analysis within the department. That includes taking a closer look at police complaints over time.\u00a0\n\"We're going to take this information from the commissioner,\"\u00a0 Connolly said. \"We're going to start getting into that a little bit deeper, trying to find some trends, find some common themes with some of these reports so we can address any issues that we may see.\"\nConnolly\u00a0couldn't say if the department's analysis would be made public.\u00a0\n\"If we see trends or if things are trending in this direction or there's an issue with this type of a complaint, I think at that point in time, we might be able to make some recommendations, work collaboratively to try to address some of those issues,\" he said.\nOn mobile? \nClick here\n to send us your tip about police complaints."},

Here's what the latest rate hike means for you\nListen\nWhat rising interest rates mean for Canadians\nSome with variable rates have seen their payments go\u00a0up constantly. For those trying to break into the housing, the\u00a0rising rates have also made things even harder.\nThe cost to borrow for small businesses is currently about 9.3 per cent, says the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.  \n \n(Shutterstock)\n\"People who qualified for a certain amount before rates went up\u00a0now don't qualify for that same amount,\" Reddin said.\n\"So they're struggling to find homes for what they're preapproved for, because rates are so high.\"\nBusinesses feeling the squeeze\nBusinesses are also feeling the effects of rising interest rates.\nA recent survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows\u00a0borrowing costs are now the biggest financial constraint its members face.\n \nThe arts and recreation, hospitality sector that were really hard hit during the pandemic, they're barely breathing.\n\u2014 Frederic Gionet\n\"The arts and recreation, hospitality sector that were really hard hit during the pandemic, they're barely breathing,\" said\u00a0Frederic Gionet, senior policy analyst with the CFIB.\n\"They were hoping for a good season, a good tourism season to prop that up.\u00a0But one season may not fix the entire problem. And having these debts roll over into higher interest will just increase the cost of them doing business and put them in an even more precarious position.\"\nFrederic Gionet, CFIB senior policy analyst for the Atlantic region, says businesses hit hard by the pandemic are seeing their debt roll over into higher interest. \n \n(CBC/Zoom)\nGionet said small businesses pay about 2.1 per cent above the prime rate, meaning their cost to borrow would currently be about 9.3 per cent.\nIn February 2022, a\u00a0$50,000 loan paid monthly\u00a0for five years would have cost $5,811 in interest. The same $50,000 loan today would\u00a0cost $12,330 in interest over the same period,\u00a0a $6,519 increase.\nMore than half of the small businesses in the CFIB survey had to put up personal guarantees, such as their homes and other assets, to receive loans.\nAnalysis\nIs the Bank of Canada making things worse?\nListen\nWhat consumers should expect after yet another rate hike\nThe businesses surveyed\u00a0said they may need the loan for cash flow, or to buy equipment or inventory.\u00a0\n\"Regardless if they want to or not, they might not have the choice but to pass these costs down to consumers,\" Gionet said. \"So they're further contributing to inflation.\"\nRelief ahead?\nMeanwhile, inflation has cooled considerably across the country. That's especially true for\u00a0P.E.I., which consistently led the country on inflation in recent years.\nCanada's annual inflation rate fell to 2.8 per cent in June, its\u00a0lowest in more than two years. In P.E.I., the rate was only 0.2 per cent.\nP.E.I.'s monthly inflation rate shrank in June, thanks to lower fuel prices\nCanada's inflation rate falls to 2.8%\nReddin hopes there will be some relief in the months ahead.\n\"The majority of the [rate] increases are probably behind us. We just have to learn how to live in this new environment for a little while,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"No doubt they're not going down any time soon. But I don't think they're going up a lot further.\""},

He's left them behind\u00a0as he travels around the country on\u00a0a summer tour to highlight Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's perceived failings.\nThe new look\u00a0took effect shortly after \nthe party narrowly held\n\u00a0the London-area riding of Oxford, Ont. \u2014 seen as a Conservative stronghold \u2014 while putting up a\u00a0poor showing in a potentially winnable suburban seat, Winnipeg South Centre, in the June \nbyelections\n.\nSpeaking to reporters at a press conference in Niagara Falls, Ont. on Wednesday, Poilievre acknowledged he's undergone a modest makeover.\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre in Niagara Falls on July 19, 2023.\n \n(Martin Trainor/CBC)\nDressed in a pair of bootleg blue jeans and wearing aviator sunglasses like those worn by Tom Cruise in the Top Gun movies, Poilievre said his wife, Anaida, thinks he \"looks better without glasses so I have to keep her happy first and foremost.\"\nWATCH:\u00a0Poilievre gets a new look: \nWhat's up with Pierre Poilievre's new look?\n16 hours ago\nDuration \n2:01\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has ditched the glasses and started wearing more casual clothes in a bid to widen his appeal to voters.\nIt's not just the clothes. Poilievre, known for sparring with reporters, also accepted a follow-up question from CBC News about his image revamp.\n\"Normally we don't allow supplementary questions,\"\u00a0Poilievre said,\u00a0pointing to the majestic waterfall behind him,\u00a0\"but it's such a beautiful place \u2014 you've softened my heart.\"\n\"Whether or not I wear glasses, I have the best vision for the country. A vision for lower cost, more affordable groceries, safer streets. That's the vision Canadians want. Let's bring it home,\" a smiling Poilievre added, using his campaign slogan.\nConservative MP Pierre Poilievre rises in the House of Commons to apologize for making an obscene gesture in Ottawa on June 14, 2006.\n \n(Tom Hanson/Canadian Press)\nA spokesperson for Poilievre didn't respond to a request for further comment.\nChad Rogers is a longtime Conservative strategist who has known Poilievre for years. He said Poilievre isn't strictly a buttoned-up politico.\nPoilievre follows CrossFit, a high-intensity fitness regimen, and kicks back in casual clothes with his friends and close confidants, Rogers said \u2014 a side of the leader that's not well known to voters.\nTrudeau has 100 per cent recognition in public opinion polls, while Poilievre is a lesser-known figure, Rogers said. Poilievre has to define himself before his opponents do it first, he added.\n\"Pierre has a work persona. He wears a suit and tie and glasses and looks all business when he's on the floor of Parliament. He looks pretty different when he's out, you know, rolling a 200-pound truck tire,\" Rogers said in an interview, referring to a CrossFit exercise.\n\"I don't think Pierre Poilievre has a new look. I think we're just looking at Pierre Poilievre more frequently.\"\nConservative MP Pierre Poilievre rises in the House of Commons to apologize for a comment about Indigenous people on June 12, 2008.\n \n(Tom Hanson/Canadian Press)\nBut the Conservative insider and lobbyist said Poilievre and his team are clearly making a concerted effort\u00a0to present a more casual, laid-back image to voters who may be leery of him.\nPoilievre isn't the first conservative politician to adjust his image before asking voters to put his party in power.\nFormer Reform Party leader Preston Manning dropped the coke-bottle glasses and the ill-fitting suits when making a run for the country's top job.\nReform Leader Preston Manning explains his party's policies during a press conference in Vancouver in 1996.\n \n(Kim Stallknecht/Canadian Press)\nFormer prime minister Stephen Harper famously adopted sweater vests as a favoured fashion accessory\u00a0to present a dressed-down, more domestic image to voters.\nPoilievre's more recent\u00a0predecessors, Andrew Scheer and Erin O'Toole, slimmed down ahead of their respective federal elections.\nO'Toole took up running and\u00a0pounded\u00a0the pavement every day on the campaign trail. He showed off his new physique in campaign literature. The 2021 Conservative party platform featured a cover photo\u00a0of O'Toole in a tight black T-shirt.\nFormer Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole holds up his platform book as he speaks to supporters at a campaign rally on August 25, 2021 in Hamilton, Ont.\n \n(Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press)\nRogers said Poilievre could succeed where others failed because he's making a pivot so far out from the next election.\n\"You can't fatten a pig on market day. You can't do everything at the last minute. You can't suddenly become the perfect version of yourself weeks before an election and say, 'By the way, I'm now slightly better-looking, slightly more active,'\" he said.\n\"Previous leaders have failed when they've done it because it was very inauthentic. They said, 'I'm embracing a cool new image,' but they clearly didn't look comfortable.\"\nLaura Peck is the vice-president of Transformational Leadership Consultants in Ottawa. She has led seminars and coaching sessions with politicians and business leaders on image and communications for 30 years.\nPeck said Poilievre's\u00a0attempt at softening his image is a bid\u00a0to win over sceptical voters who haven't warmed up to him and his attack-dog style.\nShe said the changes have \"happened really quickly\" and are \"really noticeable\" to keen political observers.\nPeck said Poilievre's\u00a0public speaking voice has also changed. He's speaking in a \"a slower, more measured tone,\" she said \u2014 likely an attempt to woo voters turned off by the\u00a0aggressive style he usually\u00a0displays in the House of Commons.\nConservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre wears a cowboy hat during the Calgary Stampede parade on July 7, 2023.\n \n(Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press)\n\"They probably did some focus group testing to figure out who their voter universe is. Where are the swing voters? The byelections didn't go so well for them, so they're really trying to pick up their vote. They're making a change to try and give the party an edge and accumulate more voters,\" she said.\n\"This is a brand strategy that all leaders go through. They just have to make sure Poilievre's brand is authentic. He has to be able to live with it when all of this is over.\""},

Earlier that day, it had been\u00a0removed from service after the operator detected a burning smell.\nAccording to a rail safety advisory letter issued by the Transportation Safety Board (TSB) the following month, one of the train's splined (ridged) axles had likely failed hours earlier while the train was\u00a0still in service.\nWhen crews attempted to re-rail the train that night, they discovered that one of its wheels was no longer attached to its axle \"due to a previously undetected catastrophic roller bearing failure and subsequent axle journal burn-off.\"\nTo understand that, it's important to picture how these trains are built. Each two-vehicle train has 10\u00a0\"bogies,\" five per vehicle. A bogie is the undercarriage assembly\u00a0that hold the train's wheels \u2014 think of the trucks on a skateboard \u2014 three of which are motorized while the remaining two are \"trailers.\"\nThe Iponam bogie axle assembly in use on Ottawa's light rail trains.\n \n(Alstom)\nEach bogie has two axle assemblies, and each axle has two wheels. Each wheel is attached to the axle with a cartridge assembly that holds the roller bearings, and the whole thing is held together with a large locking nut.\nAfter the August 2021 derailment, investigators found roller bearings\u00a0on the track near uOttawa station, suggesting the failure had occurred earlier that afternoon while the train was travelling west.\nAlstom's own investigation determined the failure was due to the undetected loosening of the locking nut that holds the cartridge assembly\u00a0together.\nInspections ordered\nWithin hours of the derailment, the city decided to park its entire fleet of LRT vehicles to inspect each and every axle for loose cartridge assemblies, replacing\u00a0any showing more than one-tenth of a millimetre of \"play.\" It took five days.\nIn addition to the cartridge assembly that failed and caused the derailment, the inspections found 17 loose assemblies on nine different vehicles.\nAccording to the TSB, the city has since implemented a \"labour-intensive\" schedule requiring similar inspections every 7,500 kilometres. The assembly that failed in August 2021 had accumulated nearly 150,000 kilometres before the incident. According to the TSB, it should last for more than 1.2 million kilometres.\nWorkers wearing hard hats are seen near the site of a train derailment west of the Tremblay LRT station in Ottawa on Monday, Sept. 20.\n \n(Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)\nThe TSB further noted that the construction of these particular cartridge assemblies prevents easy visual inspection for signs of overheating, nor does Ottawa have any wayside or on-board temperature monitoring system in place.\u00a0\n\"Consequently, an overheated roller bearing within the cartridge assembly can potentially fail catastrophically without being observed or detected. As demonstrated in this occurrence, such a failure can also lead to derailment if there is no intervention,\" the TSB wrote in its September 2021 advisory letter.\nDespite these warnings, a second derailment occurred within weeks of the first, and the cause was likely related.\nOn Sept. 19, 2021, a westbound train with 12 passengers aboard derailed near Tremblay\u00a0station. There were no injuries. Following that derailment, the entire fleet was parked for nearly two months, with service resuming\u00a0Nov.\u00a012.\nThe cause of that derailment was loosely, though undeniably,\u00a0related to the earlier one: An Alstom employee had failed to properly tighten some bolts after replacing a cartridge bearing assembly, part of the remedial work ordered after the August 2021 incident.\nA gearbox that fell from a passing light rail train sits beside the tracks near Tremblay station in Ottawa in September 2021. Human error was blamed in that derailment.\n \n(Transportation Safety Board)\n'Ongoing failures' concern TSB\nIn February, the TSB \nissued another advisory letter\n expressing concern over \"ongoing failures\" of the roller bearing assemblies, and noted\u00a0the city had not acted on its recommendations to monitor the machinery\u00a0for overheating.\n\"To date, other than ongoing cartridge assembly free play monitoring, no concrete steps have been taken to resolve the safety deficiency identified in the [previous advisory letter],\" the TSB wrote.\u00a0\nIn July 2022, a train operator detected an unusual vibration aboard one of the vehicles. Upon inspection, it was discovered that one of the axle hubs was so severely damaged that \"catastrophic failure was likely to occur had it remained in service.\"\nThe TSB subsequently inspected three cartridge assemblies at its engineering laboratory\u00a0and discovered widespread damage \"not limited to any particular component.\" Rather, the TSB pointed to the design of the vehicles themselves\u00a0\u2014 Ottawa was the first city to use the Citadis Spirit\u00a0\u2014 and their \"more powerful drivetrain.\"\u00a0\nWhile other Alstom models use the same cartridge assemblies, the TSB noted Ottawa's articulated trains are longer, heavier and required to carry more passengers at higher speeds than are trains in other cities such as Paris and Istanbul,\u00a0where there have been far fewer defects.\nRen\u00e9e Amilcar, OC Transpo's general manager of transit services, attends a transit committee meeting on June 29, 2023.\n \n(Jean Delisle/CBC)\nIn addition, the\u00a0Ottawa Light Rail Transit Public Inquiry noted in its final report in December that the LRT system's \"wheel/rail interface\"\u00a0\u2014 essentially, how the trains' wheels fit the track\u00a0\u2014 \ncontinues to pose a critical concern\n.\nNow a new round of inspections is underway, but there is growing evidence that Ottawa's LRT system could require a dramatic overhaul if it's ever going to provide safe, reliable service to the residents who rely on it.\u00a0\nOttawa Morning\n8:56\nA primer on bearings \u2013 the part that\u2019s to blame for LRT shutdown.\nWe ask a mechanical engineer and professor at the University of Ottawa to explain why a key component keeps failing on Ottawa's troubled trains."},

He told media and Senate ethics officer Pierre Legault he had been drinking that evening. In the recording, MacDonald is heard asking that he not be recorded, and the videographer falsely claims he is not on tape.\nSenator breached six sections of code, watchdog rules\nThe watchdog has ruled MacDonald breached six sections of the code that governs senators, leaving a \"significant impact\" on the institution.\n\"Senators are expected to represent Canadians, not denigrate, mock and demean them, while encouraging illegal activities at a time when a state of emergency had been declared,\" Legault wrote in a report released Tuesday.\nHe said the senator's request to not be filmed showed \"an intentional failure to exercise dignified reserve and restraint.\"\nLegault has ruled that MacDonald's comments broke rules that senators \"uphold the highest standards of dignity inherent to the position of Senator\" and \"refrain from acting in a way that could reflect adversely on the position of Senator or the institution of the Senate.\"\nThe investigation began when nine of MacDonald's peers submitted complaints. The senator acknowledged that he'd fallen short, welcoming Legault's guidance on how to rectify the situation.\nMacDonald: 'This is definitely not an ethical issue'\nThe watchdog asked MacDonald to undertake three actions, two of which he followed: an apology in the chamber that would also be posted on social media.\nThe third proposed action was to have MacDonald note to his colleagues that his conduct could merit a censure, which is a formal expression of the Senate's disapproval of something.\nWATCH | Senator caught on video criticizing Ottawa residents during 'Freedom Convoy' protests:\u00a0\nSenator decries entitled Ottawa Residents\n1 year ago\nDuration \n2:14\nSen.

In a letter to the ethics office, the lawyer called it \"an insidiously coercive example of compelled speech.\"\nLegault, MacDonald and his lawyer exchanged a series of letters for more than a year, with the senator declining to answer a list of detailed questions he deemed to be irrelevant and matters of \"partisan debate\" that raised \"highly controversial public policy matters.\"\nOttawa can't 'move on' from convoy protest without redress, people's commission finds\nResidents abandoned to a violent occupation during 'Freedom Convoy': Report\nThe senator was particularly upset at the watchdog asking whom he had dined with before he made his comments. Legault said that information may have been relevant to determining who had witnessed the exchange with the person who filmed the remarks, and whether the senator was conducting parliamentary duties at the time.\nMacDonald eventually sought to have a Senate committee take up the issue, which the office said would undermine the investigation process, which is supposed to be kept confidential and free of political interference.\n\"His lack of co-operation was a flagrant disregard for the process outlined under the code and that has been duly adopted by the Senate,\"\u00a0Legault wrote.\nHe said MacDonald should have shown \"true remorse\" for his comments by telling his peers they could issue a censure.\nSenate committee could arrange hearings\nLegault found MacDonald further undermined the code's requirement to act \"with dignity, honour and integrity\" while undertaking parliamentary duties, because of his repeated refusal to comply with the investigation. For that reason, the officer is now recommending \"sanctions of penalties by the Senate\" against MacDonald.\n\"His conduct in this respect was so egregious that there are no measures that would remedy the harm that his actions have caused to the office of senator and the institution of the Senate,\" the ethics officer wrote.\nOttawa residents on both sides of the truck convoy protests tell us what's changed 1 year later\nFreedom Convoy a 'relentless disturbance,' says people's commission\n\"This is the first time a senator has not only refused to respect and comply with the inquiry process under the Code but has also argued for and attempted to follow a process that he himself has designed for his own inquiry.\"\nThe Senate's conflict-of-interest committee will receive the report and may arrange hearings on the matter, although the Senate is adjourned until Sept. 19.\nIn an email sent Tuesday, MacDonald said he would discuss the report with that committee. \"Out of respect for the process, I won't be commenting further at this time.\"\nMacDonald has been a senator since he was appointed on the advice of former prime minister Stephen Harper in 2009."},

There is still no indication of when trains will be cleared to resume service.\nIn the meantime, the City of Ottawa's goal has been an R1 bus every five minutes during rush hour.\nFirst, that meant 28 buses.\nTwo days later the count\u00a0was up to 32, and as of Thursday\u00a0morning commuters could\u00a0expect to have 36 buses driving the route.\nThe city didn't refer to that boost\u00a0as an attempt to improve on its five-minute goal, but rather as an effort\u00a0to \"increase reliability.\"\nWhen will LRT reopen?

During Wednesday morning rush hour, another 65 trips were pulled.\nWhile those concessions can get more vehicles\u00a0on the replacement route, the city recognizes a bus\u00a0can\u00a0never have the capacity to fully replace train service. Depending on its size, an OC Transpo\u00a0bus fits anywhere between 85 and 110 passengers, while a two-car Alstom train can carry up to 600.\n\"That is the reality we're grappling with,\" said Barrhaven East Coun.

Seventeen loose assemblies were found on nine different vehicles, excluding the failed cartridge assembly that caused the derailment.\nThen, in September 2021,\u00a0the line \nwas shut down for a month and 23 days\n after it was discovered that some bolts hadn't been properly tightened during servicing after the August derailment.\nPartial service resumed Nov. 12.\nCBC is bringing back its LRT shutdown count-up clock.

Jeff Leiper, a member of the city's transit commission. His understanding is that the briefing is\u00a0still on track for that month, he told CBC Radio's \nOttawa Morning\n on Wednesday.\nIn the meantime, it appears preventative measures aren't working.\n\"They thought that they would be able to run the train safely with increased inspections, and more frequent maintenance, and the slow orders that take the train much slower through portions of the track,\" Leiper said.\n\"Clearly, and frustratingly, it looks like they may have to take yet further mitigations in order to be able to run the train,\u00a0ahead of fixing the root cause of whatever that problem is that's causing those bearings to fail prematurely.\"\nPeople wait for buses at Ottawa's Tunney's Pasture station the morning of July 19, 2023.

Most of the time they're happy just to hide out of sight in dark damp places and avoid any human encounter. Still, Thompson admits that while he likes bugs, he finds earwigs unsettling.\u00a0\n\"Especially when I'm camping, I don't like them in my tent,\" he said. \"Even though I know it's irrational because they're harmless.\"\u00a0\nEarwigs are flourishing on P.E.I. this season. Here's why\nSo why do people find earwigs so off-putting?\nThompson thinks it's an insect with an image problem, and that those long, pointy pincers have a lot to do with it.\u00a0\n\"They just look weird and not friendly,\" he said. \"But they're not harmful to humans at all. It's purely an aesthetic dislike that people have of them. [The fear] is almost primal.\"\nAn earwig hides in a crack in an old piece of wood in a backyard in London, Ont.\n \n(Travis Dolynny/CBC)\nThe pincers \u2014 called \"cercai\" \u2014 extend outward from the insect's abdomen and ramp up the earwig \"ick\" factor. \"Pincher bugs\" is a common nickname used for earwigs, even though they're not known to use the appendage to aggressively pinch people. Thompson said even if an earwig was motivated to pinch a person, the pincers aren't powerful enough to break the skin.\nSometimes earwigs will arch up their pincers when they feel threatened, another behaviour that doesn't endure them to humans.\u00a0\nAnd while the pincers don't pack much pinching punch on people, Thompson said earwigs use them grab food and defend themselves against other insects.\u00a0\nLay eggs in your ear? That's not a thing\nNot helping the earwig's public image is a false bit of folklore about them targeting sleeping humans.\n\"The story was that at night they would burrow\u00a0into your ear and deposit eggs into your brain, which of course is completely false but that's where the name comes from,\" said Thompson.\u00a0\nJeremy McNeil, an entomologist and biology professor at Western University, also often hears the \"earwigs in ears\" story.\u00a0\n\"If you find earwigs in your ears, you have got greater problems than earwigs,\" said McNeil. \"If your ears are full of decomposing vegetation, then it's not the earwigs you should worry about.\"\u00a0\nThompson doesn't think a recent increase in social media posts about earwigs has anything to do with the insect's overall population numbers.\u00a0\n7 things to know about earwigs\n\"They do very well in urban environments,\" said Thompson. \"Particularly around debris, rotting logs and under cement slabs. So people will notice them now because this is the time that people are working in their backyards.\"\u00a0\nEarwigs are also nocturnal and in the insect world qualify as \"semi social\" because they like to hang out in family groups. Flip over a chunk of wet firewood and you'll likely see not one, but many. They stick together, and the females take an active role in caring for their offspring after they hatch, which Thompson said isn't overly common for insects.\nBecause earwigs like to hide in damp and decaying wood, a bug expert at Western University recommends keeping yards clear of debris as a way to avoid earwig encounters. \n \n(Jane Robertson/CBC)\nThe male and female find a warm nook to ride out the winter together, then mate in the spring. After that happens, the male is typically kicked out of the nest, possibly because Dad earwigs are known to eat their offspring.\n\"It's the equivalent of getting divorced,\" McNeil. \"It's a fascinating insect.\"\u00a0\nJust when you thought earwigs couldn't get any weirder, they actually have wings and the ability to fly, but rarely choose to take to the skies.\nSo how can people minimize encounters of the earwig kind?\nThompson recommends keeping yards, basements and other moist, damp areas free of debris, especially anything organic like wood or paper that can become wet and attract earwigs.\u00a0 \nThompson also said cardboard can be used as a kind of earwig trap. Lay it out, get it wet it and the earwigs can't resist coming inside. Then you can put on a pair of gloves and tap out the frame well away from a residence.\u00a0\nEarwigs are scavengers and omnivores, willing to make a meal of almost anything alive or dead they happen to find (even other earwigs).\nSo are earwigs a pest?\u00a0\nMcNeil is an avid gardener who says while earwigs sometimes nibble on plants they don't do damage on par with other pests, such as the Japanese beetle.\u00a0\n\"They get a bad rap,\" he said.\nLISTEN | Are you seeing more earwigs than normal?\nLondon Morning\n6:01\nAre you seeing more earwigs than normal this year?\nWestern University biology professor Graham Thompson joins London Morning to share some earwig knowledge."},

The counties outside of London are full of hidden gems, so we're asking the people who know their county best to give their top three list of must-dos.\u00a0\nTaylor Rummell is a tourism specialist with Middlesex County.\nShe shared her top picks for an unforgettable Middlesex County road trip on \nCBC London Morning\n.\n1. Alpacas abound\nMiddlesex County is quickly becoming a haven for alpacas, with seven separate alpaca farms having cropped up in the area, according to Rummell. So, among the multitude of agro-tourism options in the county, like petting zoos and horseback riding, it's no surprise that alpacas top her list.\n\"They're funny animals. You kind of don't know what you're going to get, but they're just fun to be around for sure,\" she said.\nAlpaca farms include opportunities from walking alpacas, to\u00a0feeding them, to dining\u00a0alongside them. At places like \nS.A.M.Y.'s Alpaca Farm & Fibre Studio\n, you can even expect to bring a piece of Middlesex County home with you in the form of products made from local Alpaca fibre.\nS.A.M.Y.'s Alpaca Farm & Fibre Studio provides overnight accommodations and one-on-one time with alpacas.\n \n(S.A.M.Y.'s Alpaca Farm & Fibre Studio)\n\"Most of these alpaca farms offer the tourism experience, which is walking the alpacas down a country lane. You can feed these alpacas, and\u00a0in most cases, there's on-site stores where you can purchase products that were actually made,\" said Rummell.\u00a0 \"Products like hats, mitts, socks, even blankets sometimes.\"\nSome farms even offer overnight accommodations and workshops.\n2. Historic immersion\nMiddlesex is home to various museums that share the history and culture of the region. Close to the top of Rummell's list is the \nLucan Area Heritage & Donnelly Museum\n. The story of the Black Donnellys, an Irish Catholic immigrant family who were mobbed and killed by locals in\u00a0what is now Lucan Biddulph\u00a0in 1880,\u00a0is familiar to many locals.\nFor those hoping to learn more, or to step into the shoes of the family, Rummell\u00a0recommends a Donnelly-themed escape room at the museum.\nTaylor Rummell is a tourism specialist with Middlesex County. She joined Rebecca Zandbergen on London Morning to talk tourism in Middlesex County.\n \n(Rebecca Zandbergen/CBC News)\n\"So this one is very unique in the sense that you do it in an old\u00a0heritage home. The theme this year is the diary of William Donnelly. So you'll kind of follow clues in these diary pages to figure out the combinations to get your way out of there,\" she said.\nShe recommends that anyone with an interest in history follow the museum online for alerts regarding special events.\n3. Next level glamping\nIf a serene retreat is what you're looking for, Rummell's third pick may be the option for you.\nFernwood Hills\n\u00a0provides the option to stay in miniature cabins where you can\u00a0disconnect from everyday\u00a0life.\n\"It's just you, your partner, you're enjoying the peacefulness of nature and sights of wildlife,\" said Rummell. \"It's just a peaceful, tranquil experience that everybody can enjoy.\"\nThe secluded grounds include walking trails and campfires, along with the ever-present possibility of spotting a deer or two in the wild.\nLISTEN | Three must-dos on a road trip in\u00a0Middlesex County:\nLondon Morning\n5:53\nThree must-dos on a road trip in Middlesex County\nMiddlesex County tourism specialist Taylor Rummell joins London Morning with a list of fun things to do this summer in Middlesex County."},

During this year, the survivors who had chicks have intact nests and the majority are still alive as you can see here in this park,\" said Koskinas, adding he's noticed even higher numbers at Gibbons Park.\nCanada geese and goslings swimming in the Thames River in London, Ont., on June 8, 2023.\n \n(Travis Dolynny/CBC)\nThat's a solid theory according to Brian Salt, the CEO of the Salt Haven Wildlife Rehabilitation and Education Centre in Strathroy.\n\"Geese are really a vector species for highly pathogenic avian influenza, as are all shore birds, and that's taken a toll on the Canada goose population,\" he said.\nSalt added that between late March and May, geese will defend their nests, territory and young. As of July, the goslings have had time to mature, making their numbers more visible.\n\"They'll be learning how to fly pretty soon and be a bit awkward.\"\nWATCH | Canada geese eating in the grass at Ivy Park:\nCanada geese at Ivy Park in downtown London\n5 days ago\nDuration \n0:24\nIvy Park has become a popular hangout for Canada geese in London, with a new generation of goslings joining the local poplulation.\nPopulation has been steadily increasing\nThe number of Canadian geese have been steadily going up over the past few decades and not from a recent population boom, said Brendan Samuels, a PhD candidate at Western University with the Advanced Facility for Avian Research.\nThe Canadian Wildlife Service estimates there are more than\u00a0\n400,000 Canadian geese\n\u00a0in the province.\nSamuel said that humans contribute to Canada geese congregating in large numbers by feeding them, leading to the illusion of a population boom.\n\"When they're fed in excess, the geese might also not migrate at all. They might find that there's enough food here and they can just stick around over the winter months,\" he said.\nWATCH | What are geese thinking when they block traffic?

It can be outright deadly for them.\nSalt said when geese eat bread, it becomes a dough-like substance that lodges itself in their digestive tract and can make it impossible for other food to get past.\n\"Even if they survive that, the nutritional value of bread for [waterfowls] is negligible and doesn't do them much good. It leaves them open to diseases that otherwise they wouldn't have to wrestle with,\" said Salt. \"We feed them for our own satisfaction, not for their benefit.\"\nA goose nest in a London, Ont., parking lot planter?

Where is all that water going?\nAshley Rammeloo:\u00a0\nWell, eventually it'll make its way back into the environment, whether that's soaking into the ground or making its way into creeks and/or the river directly. So what we do is we're trying to make sure that water gets there while causing as little impact to the residents as possible, but also protecting the environment.\nMA: So are you guys pulling your hair out when you think about things like climate change and increasing amounts of water and precipitation?\nAR:\u00a0\nIt's definitely a concern. The biggest impact we've seen is the intensity of the storms. We'll get a storm where we get a month's worth of rain overnight, and although our infrastructure can take the total volume, it can't move it away as fast as it's coming. That's when you tend to get those streets flooding. It goes away fairly quickly, but there is a time period when it's sitting on the road.\nPart of our consideration is how to get that water away quickly enough, but also we have to balance that on the other end because when it goes into those creeks and the river, you have to be managing those flows too so that you don't get a lot of erosion along the banks.\nAshley Rammeloo is the director of water, wastewater and stormwater with the City of London's engineering department.\n \n(Kate Dubinksi/CBC)\nMA: How is infrastructure adjusting to that? How is the design of storm drains or culverts being adjusted over the years?\nAR:\u00a0\nWe design those according to what's called a 'whatever year storm.' So, for instance, the highest-rated storms are the one-in-100-year and the one-in-250-year, like a hurricane. Not all of the sewers underneath the road are sized to those because they would be massive and we can't really construct it realistically from a financial or a space perspective. So we have to look for a middle ground.\nWhen it comes to things that are for flood protection specifically, we're now looking at designing for that 250-year storm, whereas we used to design them for 100-year storms.\nWATCH | How climate change is impacting future infrastructure planning in London:\nPlanning for increased rain events for London's stormwater system\n7 days ago\nDuration \n1:42\nAshley Rammeloo, the director of water, wastewater and stormwater at the City of London, joined London Morning to talk about planning for extreme weather events with guest host Matt Allen on July 13, 2023.\nMA: So you're having to plan for even more extreme events more often now?\nAR:\u00a0\nWe do, yeah. Also, with those higher-intensity rainfalls, we're looking at ways we can actually infiltrate water more in the areas where it falls. For example, LIDs, or low-impact developments, like rain gardens that people can put in on their property to help absorb some of that water so it doesn't run off and cause so much flooding.\nMA: What are some of the things that homeowners can do to prepare for these extreme events?\nAR:\u00a0\nSo if you have a sump pump, if you have a backwater valve, make sure those are functioning. Always make sure your downspouts are pointed well away from your foundation.\nLonger term, if you're doing projects in the yard or you're changing the grade of your yard, make sure you're still keeping that water flowing away from the house, and that you're not flooding out yourself or a neighbour.\nIf you have a home built prior to 1985, make sure your weeping tiles have been disconnected from the sanitary sewer. We used to allow those foundation drains to drain the stormwater and it would then overwhelm the sanitary sewer and then you get sanitary sewage backup into your basement as a result of the large rain. It's nasty. You don't wanna deal with it.\nLISTEN | Ashley Rameloo on CBC London Morning on stormwater and city infrastructure:\nLondon Morning\n6:29\nDraining the rain\nWhen the rain falls, it makes its way to waterways, and hopefully not our basements.

Mood disorder symptoms can range from depression, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, along with difficulties eating or sleeping and caring for oneself and their child.\u00a0\n\"CBT is one of the most effective ways to treat postpartum mood disorders because if we're able to interrupt feelings causing those negative thoughts by changing the ways we're processing them, it can lead to lifelong change and improvement,\" said Andrews.\u00a0\nCBT is a\u00a0\nform of psychotherapy\n\u00a0helping clients identify, question and change thoughts, attitudes and beliefs related to emotional and behavioural reactions causing them difficulties.\u00a0\nEmily Dietrich, 32, of St. Catharines, Ont., struggled with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder when her then one-month-old son Jack was hospitalized for bacterial meningitis at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in May, 2020.\nDietrich took part in a similar program at Niagara Region Public Health in a study phase with McMaster University in 2021.\n\"It was definitely a very dark time, but the tools I learned were so helpful because it really teaches you to reframe negative thoughts,\" she said.\u00a0\nGroup model creates lifelong connections\nSouthwestern Public Health has two virtual sessions available for Woodstock and St. Thomas in September and October.

It's\u00a0the only one out of the five that's privately owned,\u00a0thanks to a rare\u00a0agreement struck between city hall and its former owners\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the children and living heirs of the late Julia and Alan Beck.\u00a0\nThe cottage was built in 1858 by Robert Carfrae, a carpenter who worked on London's Old Courthouse. The home is one of the earliest examples of craftsman style architecture in the city and while nothing historical has ever happened there, the former home of preservationist\u00a0Julia Beck is considered a\u00a0defacto shrine to London's heritage\u00a0movement.\u00a0\nOn Monday night,\u00a0politicians instructed city lawyers and heritage planners to stop sending Gard legal threats about restoring the cottage's original fireplaces, while emphasizing staff should \"work with the owner\" to find a less expensive solution to replacing the 165-year-old building's leaky and decrepit roof\u00a0with cedar shingles at a cost of $130,000.\u00a0\n'Heritage can't trump safety,' says deputy mayor\n\"Right now, we have a roof that has some leaks and staff have said they recognize it's past its life cycle. So the longer we wait, regardless of the material, the more expensive the repairs get and the closer we get to demolition by neglect,\" said Deputy Mayor Shawn Lewis.\nWhile staff told council they were 'working with' Gard, the owner of Carfrae Cottage, they also threatened him with legal action, including the\u00a0'right of entry' and 'the laying of charges under the Ontario Heritage Act.'\n \n(Colin Butler/CBC News)\nBureaucrats\u00a0had ordered Gard to obtain quotes on a roof replacement for the cottage's disintegrating pine shake roof with \"existing materials.\" But\u00a0because roofing companies\u00a0no longer use\u00a0pine, the only option for wooden shingles was cedar at a cost of $130,000, Gard said.\nGard\u00a0pointed out\u00a0a laundry list of other historical errors in the city's demands, including the fact there was\u00a0no historical evidence the cottage ever had a roof made from wood prior to 2001.\u00a0City lawyers responded in a letter to Gard's attorney in June. That letter\u00a0was obtained and reviewed by CBC News.\u00a0\n \nWhen a heritage designation turns out to be more of a curse than a blessing\n \n\"It is our position that none of the inaccuracies alleged diminish or otherwise affect the cultural heritage value attributes affected under the original heritage designation bylaw or the heritage easement agreement,\" city lawyer Sachit Tatavari wrote.\u00a0\nFor all of Julia\u00a0Beck's gravitas when it came to local heritage, the installation of a wooden\u00a0roof may be among the most historically inaccurate renovations\u00a0she made to the property during her time owning it.\u00a0\nWood shingles illegal in London after 1845 fire\nAccording to a copy of the book,\u00a0\n1879 City of London Charter and Bylaws\n, roofs made of wood were illegal in London.\u00a0\nPage 44 of the 1879 City of London Charter and Bylaws that forbids the use of wooden shingles in the construction of roofs. \n \n(Colin Butler/CBC News)\nThe bylaw came about after a series of fires,\u00a0starting in 1839 and culminating in\u00a0the city's great fire of\u00a01845, which\u00a0permanently\u00a0reshaped London from a city made of wood to one made of brick, according to London author Ken McTaggart's book \nLondon's Darkest Hours\n.\u00a0\n\"The consolidated bylaws of 1850 specified regulations for hearths, stoves and the storage of gunpowder. Later in the year, a bylaw was passed prohibiting the use of wooden buildings in the trade centre of the city,\" he wrote.\u00a0\nThe 1845 fire, which razed almost seven city blocks and could be seen \"as far away as St Thomas,\" would no doubt have\u00a0been in the back of Londoners'\u00a0minds when Robert Carfrae built his cottage in 1858.\u00a0\nBy 1879, city\u00a0bylaws required \"roofing of incombustible materials\" because, as McTaggart\u00a0wrote,\u00a0fires were often caused by the improper disposal of coals or the sparks from chimneys that would land on wooden shingles.\u00a0\nCity threatened owner with 'laying of charges'\nToday, Ontario has a fire code to regulate minimum standards when it comes to the protection of people and buildings. When Gard took possession of 39 Carfrae, he removed wood trim and mantle pieces from\u00a0the cottage's fireplaces to comply with the province's fire code.\nWhile nothing historical has ever happened at Carfrae Cottage, as the former home of the late Julia Beck, it is considered a\u00a0de facto shrine to London's heritage preservation movement.\u00a0\n \n(Colin Butler/CBC News)\nThe changes\u00a0caught the ire of heritage advocates, who informed city hall bureaucrats, who ordered Gard\u00a0to restore them to their original state\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or else.\n\"The city reserves the right to take any steps available at law to address this breach without further notice,\" Tatavari wrote, which he added includes the\u00a0\"right of entry\" and \"the laying of charges under the Ontario Heritage Act.\"\u00a0\nAt Monday night's committee meeting, Lewis told bureaucrats to find a way to work with Gard when it came to the fireplaces, saying the ask was unreasonable.\u00a0\n\"If it can't meet fire code, it can't meet fire code, and heritage can't trump safety,\" Lewis said.\u00a0\nIn the end, councillors voted 3-2 for staff to shelve their threats for the next six months and instead find a way to work toward\u00a0a compromise, including the possibility of revisiting the building's unique heritage easement agreement put in place by the children of the previous owners.\u00a0\nHelen, James and Graham Beck\u00a0all attended\u00a0Monday's meeting and demanded councillors vote against revisiting an\u00a0agreement Gard\u00a0called\u00a0\"one-sided\" that\u00a0would technically forbid him from even changing the gardens on a property the Beck children no longer own.\u00a0\n\"In our view, this is outrageous,\" Helen told councillors Monday. \"The heritage agreement is reasonable and clear.\n\"The agreement is between us and the city, not Mr. Gard and the city,\" she said. \"Future owners do not get to collaborate with the city.\""},

It's the first time we saw that since 2017 when we started to watch.\"\nTheir first appearance in the Gulf was a disastrous surprise\u00a0for a species on the brink of extinction and the people who earn their living in those waters.\nTwenty of the whales died in the Gulf between 2017 and 2019. The population is estimated at about 340.\nEntanglement in fishing gear is a major threat.\nInshore waters\nBrett Gilchrist, director of national programs and fisheries resource management with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, agrees this has been an unusual year.\n\"We have had several detections this year in shallow waters,\" Gilchrist said. \"We've had detections in and around P.E.I. that, frankly, haven't been seen before. A lot of harvesters are concerned about that.\"\nGilchrist said\u00a0the whales have been detected in shallow waters in the Bay of Fundy in the past.

The same whale can be detected more than once.\u00a0\nThe Shediac Valley off northern P.E.I. remains a consistent location for right whales, otherwise distribution is relatively unpredictable, according to DFO.\nThe number of season-long closures is down in 2023, but temporary closures, like the one underway in Cape Breton, are up.\nSurvey flights reduced by bad weather\nRight whales are monitored three ways:\u00a0aerial surveillance, acoustic buoys and gliders in the water.\nThe number of flights was reduced by poor weather this year, but Gilchrist said,\u00a0\"The flights are relatively comparable.\"\nSean Brillant is a senior conservation biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Federation.\n \n(CBC)\nSean Brillant of the Canadian Wildlife Federation said\u00a0even a small reduction in surveillance means whales can be missed.\nHe said\u00a0the whales are on the surface only 20 per cent of the time and if they don't make noise they can be missed by acoustic sensors.\n\"So, we always need to be very cautious,\" he said. \"We know that this is an important feeding ground for them.

It also sold roughly 150,000 copies.\n\"One of the things that you're always kind of cognizant of when you're releasing a game is, boy, I sure hope people like it,\" said Kyle Wolf, the lead designer for Ember Knights. \"When it does get out there, and you see people really picking it, picking it up and saying, 'Oh, wow, this is really fun,' it's very special.\"\nThis still shows the game Ember Knights in action, with three people playing, represented by different coloured characters. The players can be seen dodging projectiles from enemy robots.\n \n(Doom Turtle/Steam)\nEmber Knights is a hack-and-slash roguelite, a type of game that sees the player typically crawling through dangerous dungeons and battling monsters, and is defined by the permanent death of the player's character upon losing. It's a genre that has exploded in popularity in the past decade.\u00a0\n\"It's the 90s era vibe\u00a0that we're going for. It's very replayable and it's fun to play with your friends and see, 'Alright,\u00a0what are we going to get next time? What's going to happen on our next playthrough?',\" said Wolf.\nOnline reviews for the game say its\u00a0merger of striking retro visuals and engaging, snappy gameplay, make it an obvious choice for many who want to play alone\u00a0or with friends.\nNot all swords and sorcery\nBringing a game from concept to reality is harder and less glamorous than many realize,\u00a0according to Wolf.\nIt's a careful balancing act between a number of different factors.\n\"It just kind of springs from an idea,\" said Wolf, who explained that Ember Knights was conceptualized while the team was working on a separate project that had an in-game combat system. \"We kind of took that and said, 'All right, well, this is a lot of fun. How about we just expand on that?'\"\nDoom Turtle's team consists of 13 people, with jobs ranging from art to programming.\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\nThat's where designers come in\u00a0to plan largest sections of the game, while producers schedule and programmers build out concepts.\nFrom this, the team at Doom Turtle was able to create what Wolf calls a \"vertical slice\" of what their finished game might look like.\nAnd that's just the beginning.\nDeveloping a game usually involves artists, programmers, producers, designers, writers\u00a0and a multitude of other roles that work independently, and together, to form a finished product.\nOne important part of game development is art design.\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\nOne thing Doom Turtle did differently in terms of the development process is taking a player-informed approach through offering early sales of in-development versions of the game.\n\"Early Access can kind of get a little bit of a bad rap. I think you see it get abused, and you'll see games that don't get finished, or they just don't wind up kind of living up to the expectation. We really wanted to make a conscious effort to not be one of those studios, and to, you know, be talking with the people,\" said Clinton Prince, a game designer at Doom Turtle.\nWhat the future holds\nUnlike the past days of the early gaming industry, internet connection and online game marketplaces mean games often are supported and updated long past their release date.\u00a0\nThat's something Doom Turtle plans on doing, according to Evans.\u00a0\nThat doesn't mean that they're not working on anything new, though.\u00a0\n\"There's 13 of us now, and we're kind of split between\u00a0[Ember Knights and something new],\" Evans said.\nLeft to right, Clinton Prince, Brad Evans, and Kyle Wolf. The three are employees of Doom Turtle and worked directly on the Ember Knights project.\n \n(Alessio Donnini/CBC News)\nWith the release of Ember Knights, Doom Turtle joins a multitude of successful game development studios, like Digital Extremes, that call London home.\nGood game development has become something London is known for, said Evans.\n\"We've been fortunate enough to travel to events and shows in the U.S. and Germany.\u00a0London definitely has a world notoriety for being a densely populated area for good game development,\" he said.\n\"It's quite impressive to\u00a0have people know where you're from\u00a0based on that location and our history of game development here.\""},

It also purchased land outside the city to store excess material.\u00a0\nButler said the air-quality study, if approved by council next month, will help determine what action should come next.

Although a floating royalty rate is then added to that amount, it starts out at 75 cents and doesn't increase until lumber prices rise above $637 per 1,000 board feet.\nThat's significantly below levies charged on softwood saw logs in New Brunswick in the past.\u00a0 \nIn the 2015 fiscal year, with softwood lumber prices averaging $471 per 1,000 board feet, royalties on softwood logs in New Brunswick were set at $31.09. That's a 37.6 per cent higher royalty than would be charged under New Brunswick's new system at similar lumber prices.\nSurging lumber prices generate better prices for New Brunswick trees \u2014 in Maine\nNew Brunswick forest companies using publicly owned trees to face higher charges\nTo reach a royalty rate equal to what was charged back in 2015, ($31.09 per cubic metre), lumber prices now have to reach $780 per 1,000 board feet, nearly two-thirds more than lumber prices in 2015.\u00a0 \u00a0\nTo reach the even higher royalty rate of $40.60 set on softwood saw logs last year, lumber prices now have to exceed $925 per 1,000 board feet.\u00a0 \nHowever, since the new system went into effect on April 1, lumber prices have been nowhere\u00a0near those levels, averaging closer to $640.\nKim Jensen is general manager of the Carleton-Victoria Forest Products Marketing Board in Florenceville and worries lower-than-traditional royalties means prices her members can charge mills for wood will suffer\u00a0accordingly.\n\"If they're getting Crown wood at a lower price, then they are not going to pay a higher price for private wood, that's for sure,\" said Jensen.\nDustin Jalbert is a senior economist with the online commodity-price reporting service\n\u00a0fastmarkets.com\n. He said a number of factors can change the outlook, but he expects with no major surprises softwood lumber prices will settle somewhere below $750 per 1,000 board feet for the next few months.\u00a0\n\"Yeah, that's probably what we would call it,\"\u00a0Jalbertsaid\u00a0in an interview Tuesday.\nWood product analyst and economist Dustin Jalbert said he expects softwood lumber prices to stay close to current levels for the next few months.\n \n(Submitted by Dustin Jalbert)\nThat's higher than historical lumber prices but not high enough to keep royalty amounts in New Brunswick from falling below historical levels.\nAnother wrinkle in the floating royalty rate is that it is capped at 100 per cent of the base royalty.\nThat means no matter how high softwood lumber prices go, total royalties paid by companies cannot exceed $43.66 per cubic metre.\nThat limit happens when lumber prices reach $974 per 1,000 board feet even though during the two-year record escalation of lumber prices amounts regularly exceeded $1,000 and in May, 2021 exceeded $2,000.\nDoucett said a cap on how high royalties can go during surging lumber markets was not discussed at any meeting he attended, and he questions why the\u00a0province would limit revenue to itself if there is another\u00a0lumber price explosion.\n\"That's ridiculous,\" said Doucett.\n\"If you're selling lumber at $2,000 a thousand board feet, you're making lots of money. Wouldn't the government be getting a little more money out of that?\"\u00a0 \nNew Brunswick saw, pulp and other mills consume 9 million cubic metres of wood annually.  Most of it is softwood and over half of that comes from publicly owned forests that companies pay royalties to the province to cut.\n \n(Radio-Canada)\nIn a briefing to discuss the new system officials with the Department of Natural Resources said a maximum on royalties was set because a minimum was also established.\nThe department also\u00a0made the point independent woodlot owners will benefit from the new system because\u00a0revenue from the floating royalty will be spent exclusively\u00a0on services for that group.\u00a0 \nIn an email it also cautioned against comparisons of the old and new royalty systems and said while royalty rates on softwood may be lower, royalties on some hardwoods are up."},

He cited a \nrecent case in McAdam\n, where a man was sentenced to 18 months in jail.\n\"But for some individuals, they are left thinking, 'What options do I have left?'\"\nDeer Island lost RCMP officer over officer safety, says retired Mountie\nIf people or their neighbours have been victims of crime, and if they continue to turn to the police for assistance and that assistance either isn't forthcoming in a timely manner, or if the crimes are\u00a0never solved, that leads to frustration, said Boudreau.\nIf they're on social media, they might hear additional\u00a0stories\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which may\u00a0be exaggerated\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and\u00a0that adds to their anxiety and perception crime has increased.\n\"Then public fear of crime takes over and it reaches a boiling point,\" he said.\n\"And really, what we see now is a lack of confidence in policing.\"\nPublic confidence in policing at 'all-time low'\nSaint Andrews Mayor Brad Henderson contends public confidence in community policing in his region is \"at an all-time low\" and that additional resources are required to \"make people feel safe.\"\nHe wrote a letter to Public Safety Minister Kris Austin last Friday, urging a \"significant percentage\" of new provincial RCMP resources\u00a0be allocated to Charlotte County communities\u00a0to increase police presence.\n\"Doing nothing is no longer an option for any level of government,\"\u00a0Henderson wrote on behalf of council, requesting Austin visit for a meeting.\nSaint Andrews Mayor Brad Henderson says an increase in police presence in Charlotte County would be a positive indicator to residents that their communities are safe.\n \n(Submitted by Brad Henderson)\nSome\u00a0victims of crime in his community are no longer calling the RCMP to report the incidents, \"as they believe that no real response happens,\" he said.\nThere are also \"several cases of vigilante justice in our region both in the courts and unreported that will potentially increase.\"\nThe\u00a0letter was actually written before the Deer Island incidents occurred,\u00a0Henderson told CBC,\u00a0but they \"struck home even more\" why it's important to restore trust in policing.\nHe urged residents to\u00a0continue to report crimes to RCMP.\u00a0\"I think it was said best by one of our local officers when he said that they have a zero\u00a0per cent\u00a0success rate on crime that isn't isn't reported.\"\nIn addition, every reported incident helps the region \"build a better business case\" for getting more officers, Henderson said.\nSaint Andrews pays nearly $1.1 million for RCMP services, and is entitled to three officers under its unique municipal contract, according to Henderson. But the town's officers are often moved around to\u00a0other nearby communities, just as the RCMP does in municipalities that have a provincial policing contract, he said.\nPublic Safety minister discourages vigilante justice\nAustin said he understands the frustration of rural communities. He lives in rural Minto and represents Fredericton-Grand Lake. \"I\u00a0see it, I hear it on a regular basis.\"\nHe discouraged any acts of vigilante justice and assured the government is taking the situation\u00a0seriously. He pointed\u00a0to a 15 per cent budget increase to RCMP to \"beef up police presence in these rural areas that are having the struggles with crime.\"\nAbout 10 per cent of those positions have been filled so far, he said, but recruitment is a challenge due to labour shortages.\nPublic Safety Minister Kris Austin said the provincial government has allocated money for additional RCMP officers, the issue now is recruitment.\n \n(Ed Hunter/CBC)\nNew Brunswick has \"800-plus\"\u00a0RCMP officers provincewide, said Austin.\nThe government also increased funding for Crown prosecutors by 50 per cent to help bring cases before the courts more quickly, he said.\n\"So we are tackling it, but it does take time.\"\nRCMP\u00a0finalizing allocation of extra front-line officers\nThe extra $20.5 million the province provided to the RCMP is to hire\u00a080 additional officers, including 51 on the front line, said New Brunswick RCMP spokesperson Cpl.\u200b\u200b\u00a0St\u00e9phane Esculier.\nThe RCMP is finalizing the allocation of the additional officers, \"which will enable us to increase our visibility and engagement in our communities,\" Esculier said in an emailed statement. He did not say how soon the national force will be able to fill the positions.\nNew Brunswick has '800-plus' RCMP officers, according to Public Safety Minister Kris Austin.\n \n(CBC)\nThe allocation is based on workload and \"other factors,\" not a minimum number of police officers, said Esculier. \"The future allocation of police resources will be measured against these\u00a0factors, while also considering factors such as the ratio of police to population and geography.\"\n2 municipalities have 'had enough'\nResidents of Fundy Shores and Eastern Charlotte are also frustrated about a rise in crime and the level of RCMP service they're receiving, according to Fundy Shores Mayor Denny Cogswell.\n\"A lot of things that are going [on] that people are finally saying, you know, 'We've had enough. We want to see a bigger presence here.'\"\nThe mayors of the two municipalities, formed through the 2023 New Brunswick local governance reforms, met Monday with\u00a0members of their respective public safety committees\u00a0and their chief administrative officers\u00a0to discuss their policing options, he said.\nThat could include municipal, regional or provincial policing, according to Cogswell. Nothing is off the table, he said.\nFundy Shores Mayor Denny Cogswell says he believes local Mounties are doing the best they can with the resources they have, but residents have expressed frustration in calls, emails and texts about the level of policing.\n \n(Fundy Shores)\nThe two municipalities, which\u00a0include the communities of St. George, Blacks Harbour, Chance Harbour, Dipper Harbour, Lepreau, Musquash,\u00a0and surrounding areas, spend about $4 million combined on policing, said Cogswell.\n\"I think we need to look at, are we getting the best value for our money?\"\nAustin said he's open to meeting with and working with municipal officials who\u00a0have ideas to make their communities safer.\nProvincial force should be revisited\nBoudreau contends the province has been too quick to \ndismiss the idea of creating a provincial police force\n\u00a0to replace the RCMP. New Brunswick used to have one decades ago and he thinks it's a discussion worth having, he said. \"If not a provincial police, then perhaps a regional police force?\"\nRCMP\u00a0could decide to leave rural communities, said Boudreau, and they're having a hard time recruiting.\nA provincial or regional force might not be any less expensive, but it would give local officials more control over where officers are positioned, he said.\nDeer Islanders 'all happy' after alleged vigilantism rids island of accused thieves, says senior\nIn an interview Tuesday, Austin said\u00a0the province has \"never dismissed the idea of an alternative form of policing model for New Brunswick.\"\nLast April, he told\u00a0a committee of the legislature the government a \nprovincial police force was \"really not feasible\n,\" because of the costs and amount of time it would take to implement.\nThe costs would be \"astronomical\" and it would take about 10 years, he told CBC.\nThe government is open to a new model, he said. But\u00a0\"there has to be a plan in place that clearly shows that it's going to have a better outcome than what we have now.\"\nAustin called on the federal government to tell provinces its plans for RCMP and local policing long-term."},

One of them is a bilateral project with funding that will be lost if not used by 2026.\u00a0\nDeveloper Percy Wilbur during demolition of the former Woolworth's building in 2021.\n \n(Shane Fowler/CBC News)\nOn Tuesday, Wilbur said his project will proceed. He's just not sure when.\n\"Oh, absolutely. Look, nobody wants this to start more than me,\" Wilbur said when reached by phone in his vehicle.\n\"I've got several million dollars in the ground there and it's not bringing any return whatsoever, so it's imperative that I get this project going, but at the same time, it has to be a success.\"\nWATCH | This prime piece of real estate in uptown Saint John has been vacant for 2 years:\nBig hole holds up 2 Saint John construction projects\n1 day ago\nDuration \n1:44\nThe delayed construction of a 12-storey building at the corner of King and Charlotte streets in Saint John has left a hole in the ground that's holding up two other projects the city would like to start.\nHe would not commit to a timeline \"because we have to make sure that all the ducks are in line before we make a commitment to start.\"\n\"We're not making any commitments at this point. We have to make sure that the project is going to be a success. And until we do that, we're not going to make a commitment as to when we're going to start or finish.\"\nHe said supply chain issues are still a very big problem. Transformers, for example, are \"almost impossible\" to find, he said.\n\"So you can't start a project [if] you can't get the materials to complete it,\" said Wilbur, who recently completed the Wentworth, an apartment building several blocks from his current project.\u00a0\nThe former Woolworth-Bargain Shop building at the top of King Street before it was demolished in June 2021.\n \n(Connell Smith/CBC)\nAnd some things will have to be adjusted to make up for costs added to the project in the last couple of years.\nFor example, said Wilbur, labour and materials have added $8 million to the original price tag.\u00a0\n\"You can't work that into a budget as a contingency plan to have an $8 million deficit. So that's where we are now \u2014\u00a0is trying to bring our cost back down and at the same time ensure that our supply chain is solid.\"\nDespite the increased costs and supply chain issues, Wilbur said he won't pull out of the project.\u00a0\nDeveloper Percy Wilbur plans to erect a 12-storey, mostly residential building on the vacant lot. \n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC)\n\"No. What would I do with the land if I pulled out of it?\" he responded.\u00a0\n\"No. Something has to happen on that piece of property. It's an iconic piece of property and it's important that the proper building go there.\"\nWilbur said he's already spent more than $2 million.\u00a0\nSince the design isn't complete, Wilbur said, there's no estimate for the entire project.\u00a0\nSome design changes already made\nThere have been design changes made to adapt to changing economic factors.\u00a0\nThe original idea was to put office space on the second and third floor, but that's now been changed to residential units.\nThat means roughly an additional 20 units, bringing the total \"somewhere in the vicinity of 100 to 115\" apartments \u2014\u00a0and perhaps more \"if we design it slightly different,\" said Wilbur.\nWith so much empty commercial space in the city, Wilbur said, it didn't make sense to include commercial space that might sit empty upon completion,\u00a0especially when residential units are in such high demand.\u00a0\nMayor Donna Reardon said the corner of King and Charlotte is one of the city's premiere locations and should be developed soon. \n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC)\n\"A lot of buildings are vacant. So we don't want to put up a new building and have a bunch of vacant office space. So we're converting it to what we know we can fill it with, and that is apartments.\"\nHe said the new apartments on the second and third floor will be one-bedroom units.\u00a0\nBut \"at this point,\" Wilbur said there's no plan to make the other units smaller to save money.\u00a0\nAnd, there will still be retail on the street level, as originally planned, he said.\u00a0\nWilbur said he's working with the city to get the project started.\u00a0\nHolding up two\u00a0other projects\nReardon said the city is eager for Wilbur to complete his project since \"King's Square is really your premiere address in Saint John.\"\u00a0\nBut delays with his project are impacting the city's plan to \"pedestrianize\" South Market Street and complete upgrades to Charlotte Street's sidewalk and aging infrastructure.\nIn fact, the city is at risk of losing money from a bilateral agreement for the Charlotte Street project that includes sidewalks, bike lanes and green space, said Reardon.\u00a0\nSaint John Mayor Donna Reardon said the city receives at least one complaint every week about the giant hole at the corner of King and Charlotte streets and the missing sidewalk in front of the hole. The city has created a new walking area from the former turning lane onto King Street. \n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC)\n\"We can't tear up that street right now because it's not supported. So we either need to get a foundation put in there or we need to have some supporting backfill put in there.\"\u00a0\nReardon said the money from that bilateral agreement has to be used by 2026.\u00a0\n\"So we need to move that project forward as well. But that also borders on this huge vacant space that is at risk of collapsing if you start digging into the street above it.\"\nWilbur said he wasn't aware that the city was at risk of losing money.\u00a0\n\"This is the first I've ever heard that they're losing out on funding,\" he said. \"I haven't heard of that being the case.\"\nSaint John Mayor Donna Reardon says the giant hole left at the corner of King and Charlotte streets is holding up two revitalization projects the city would like to begin. \n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC)\nBut until Wilbur fills in the hole or progresses far enough with the foundation for his project, neither project can proceed, said Reardon.\nShe said the city could always take Wilbur to court over the delays and potential losses, but she said, \"I don't think we're there yet.\"\nShe said the city will continue to work with Wilbur and help find ways to get the project done, including moving to higher density, or changes that would qualify the project for federal housing grants.\u00a0\nThe revitalization of South Market Street is part of the City Market's 10-year strategic plan.\u00a0\nThe recently released plan would see \nSouth Market Street turned into a more pedestrian-friendly area, according to the document\n, which describes the future areas as \"walking priority space, with outdoor vendors, bike racks, public art, seating, weather protection, and greenery.\""},

He was critical of the Principal of Hanwell Park\u00a0Academy on social media. He made claims about the Principal that were not accurate\u00a0even after the Principal corrected him directly. These actions are particularly troubling.\"\nKing detailed another issue, which arose when Septon\u00a0took issue with whether the municipality's contract for garbage collection should be handled in closed-session meetings.\nAccording to King, the chief administrative officer obtained legal advice confirming that closed-session meetings were appropriate, to which Septon replied with \"inappropriate\" emails.\n\"Councillor Septon made comments such as, 'I\u00a0don't expect recourse or you to care,\" and \"Once again you can do no wrong,'\u00a0 \n\"The tone and implication of the\u00a0emails would be offensive to any reasonable person.\"\nCouncillors considered resigning\nMorrison said despite the findings of the investigator, Septon still refuses to admit any wrongdoing.\n\"I've had staff say they\u00a0were going to resign, and I've had councillors say they were going to resign because they basically said they didn't sign up for this.\"\u00a0\nThe mayor said some councillors and municipal staff made informal complaints that Septon breached the conduct code.\n\"Accusing council [and] staff of falsifying documents and accusing staff of lying,\" said Morrison, describing what Septon\u00a0allegedly did.\n\"A lot of accusations going on, and just stating things that were just not true.\"\nSepton\u00a0defends actions\nSpeaking after the meeting, Septon said the outcome wasn't a surprise to him.\nHe said there's a sentiment on council\u00a0that members shouldn't discuss certain issues publicly.\n\"And that's not the way council should run. It's not the way I want to run. It's not the way I want to represent my community,\" he said.\nAsked if he acknowledged whether some of what he said has been harmful to staff or councillors, Septon said some municipal staff have gone\u00a0on stress leave.\n\"Make no mistake, it's stressful for all of us,\" he said."},

It's something you have to buy to top-off your regular policy.\"\nShe also said that any tool that can help inform someone about flood risk can help that person mitigate it in advance, if possible, and lessen the number of property insurance claims in the area.\n\"We know if there's more flooding and there's more claims, all our premiums will go up because that's the way insurance works,\" said Pelletier.\nThe city received a municipal resiliency grant of $100,000 from Intact Public Entities and Intact Financial Corporation to help finance the interactive map."},

Tranjan says if they had taken a closer look, the results would have been even more bleak.\u00a0\n\"We don't have enough social housing in the country for all the folks who are presently receiving social assistance, and a large and increasing share of social assistance recipients rely on the private rental market for housing,\" he said.\n\"They're competing with minimum wage workers and with everyone else.\"\nWATCH | Average price in Canada up by 10 per cent since last year:\n\u00a0\nAverage rent has risen by 10 per cent in a year\n2 months ago\nDuration \n2:04\nThe average price for a rental home in Canada is up by 10 per cent since last year, and even cities known for lower rents, such as Montreal, are feeling the pinch.\nRaising\u00a0wages\u00a0\nHistorically, minimum wages were set by governments to\u00a0protect\u00a0non-unionized workers, reduce\u00a0the number of low-paying jobs and\u00a0alleviate poverty, among a host of other potential benefits, \naccording to the federal government\n.\u00a0\nBut today, an important part of what determines wages is the market, said Roslyn\u00a0Kunin, the president of an economic consulting firm in Vancouver, B.C.

Meanwhile, about\u00a01.1 million Canadians belonged to households where two or more\u00a0people earned\u00a0the equivalent of two full-time minimum wage jobs or less.\nAccording to Kunin, raising wages to match rental rates\u00a0would not only cause the cost of common goods to increase, but it would likely lead to the disappearance of many jobs and businesses altogether.\n\"All of us would suffer from the loss of available goods and services.\"\u00a0\nShort and long-term solutions\n\"For individuals, the best thing to do is to get as much education, experience, training as possible so you can work for a wage that's higher,\" said Kunin, adding that\u00a0obtaining additional education is \"easier than it has been\" due to the rise of online learning.\nBut\u00a0Brenda Spotton Visano, a public policy and economics professor at York University in Toronto, says these workers are often stuck in a \"catch-22\" situation, since many don't have the time or money\u00a0to upgrade their skills that might be required\u00a0for higher-paying jobs.\nMore B.C. renters are spending 'crisis-level' amounts on housing, rental housing index finds\nThis single dad makes $75K a year.

It's complicated\nMinimum wage couldn't land you a 1-bedroom unit years ago. Now, it's even worse. Here's why\nIf gasoline is stripped out of the data, the headline inflation rate would have been four\u00a0per cent. If food is stripped out, the inflation rate would have been 1.7 per cent. If mortgage costs aren't counted, the rate would have been two per cent.\nThose are great examples of why the central bank pays less attention to the headline number \u2014\u00a0because it is easily skewed by individual items that\u00a0can be volatile \u2014 and pays more attention to so-called core inflation, which smooths out the noise. Of the three core inflation measures the bank tabulates, all declined, but one is still above five per cent, while the other two are barely below four per cent.\nRoyce Mendes, an economist with Desjardins, says it's too early to think that the official rate will simply slide back down to target by itself, since the drop in June was based on one-time items that probably can't be repeated.\nRenewing a mortgage this year? Here's what the latest rate hike means for you\nHow does increasing interest rates actually help curb inflation?\n\"The latest moves have been predicated on sharp declines in cellphone services prices, which doesn't provide any assurance that this deceleration can be maintained,\" he said. Mendes said he\u00a0thinks inflation could heat up again in the coming months once the \"one-off\" price drops for things like gasoline and cellular services are gone.\nAndrew Grantham, senior economist with CIBC, says he wouldn't be surprised to see the official inflation rate inch higher in the coming months, once the year-ago comparisons become less favourable.\n\"Headline inflation will likely creep back further above three\u00a0per cent\u00a0in the coming months, as base effects from lower gasoline prices become less generous,\" he said."},

Craig Cassar (Ward 12) clapped back that the premier must not understand the term \"NIMBY-ism\" because that's the opposite of what Hamilton's proposing to meet its housing targets by building within its existing urban boundary.\u00a0\n\"Hamilton is absolutely saying, 'in my backyard,'\" Cassar said. \"That's what building a dense, thriving city is. Building on our Greenbelt is not in our backyard. It's on our farmland; it's on our wetlands; it's on our shrinking Carolinian forest.\n\"Building on the Greenbelt is quite a different 'ism.' I would suggest it's cronyism.\"\u00a0\nCoun.

Brad Clark (Ward 9), a Progressive Conservative MPP under Premiers Mike Harris and Ernie Eves from 1999 to 2003, also criticized the Ford government's plan\u00a0saying the city's message to the facilitator will be that it's extremely expensive to develop the land, as there's currently little to no existing services or infrastructure there.\nAnd if development goes ahead, wetlands need to be properly buffered and preserved and the city can charge developers to cover service and infrastructure costs, Clark said.\u00a0\nCouncil also voted for the city to hold its own public consultation next month and will request all MPs and MPPs to attend, as well as the provincial facilitator.\u00a0"},

It is a verb-based language unlike English which relies heavily on nouns.\u00a0\nK\u00e0:sere\n, for example, is the Kanien'k\u00e9ha word for car.\u00a0It literally translates to something that is dragged. Prefixes and suffixes can be added to the word to indicate ownership, descriptions of the car and the verb tense.\nFor example, \nyakoserehtsher\u00ed:yo\n means \"she has a good car.\"\u00a0\nRoot word method\nIn the '70s, Kanatawakhon studied all the Kanien'k\u00e9ha texts\u00a0he could, to source as many morphemes as he could find,\u00a0to verify rules and patterns to determine how it all fit together.\u00a0\nTehota'ker\u00e1:ton Green, a Kanien'k\u00e9ha linguist from Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory said Kanatawakhon called these \"always rules, with exceptions.\"\nGreen said he did this to learn the language more efficiently\u00a0so that he could teach it to others.\nKanatawakhon\u00a0wrote his dictionaries on\u00a0sheets colour-coded so the parts of speech could be differentiated.\nKanatawakhon initially wrote his dictionaries on sheets colour-coded so the parts of speech could be differentiated. They were organized alphabetically in Kanien\u2019keha rather than English.\n \n(Candace Maracle/CBC)\nHe\u00a0began publishing his work as dictionaries and lexicons organized alphabetically according to roots of Kanien'keha rather than English translations of Kanien'keha words as was\u00a0the established way, said Green.\u00a0\n\"This was an inspiring feat and a true contribution to Kanien'keha and Indigenous language revitalization,\" said Green.\nKanatawakhon began calling his method of organizing and teaching Kanien'keha the \"root word method.\"\nCallie Hill,\u00a0executive director of Tsi Ty\u00f3nnheht Onkwaw\u00e9n:na, an adult Kanien'k\u00e9ha\n\u00a0\nimmersion program in Tyendinaga,\u00a0was a former student.\u00a0\n\"He was just such a value to the community,\" said Hill.\n\"We would not have\u00a0any of our Tyendinaga dialect if it weren't for Kanatawakhon.\"\nHe introduced Kanien'k\u00e9ha to Tyendinaga's elementary school\u00a0in the 1970s and began teaching at the Woodland Cultural Centre in Brantford, Ont., in the 1980s.\u00a0\nIt was there that he met colleague and long-time friend Merle Richards.\u00a0\nTeaching and learning\u00a0Kanien'k\u00e9ha\nRichards, a professor at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., then on sabbatical, decided to enrol\u00a0in Kanatawakhon's\u00a0course\u00a0at the Woodland Cultural Centre.\n\"Somebody said ...\u00a0'Why is that white woman here?'\"\u00a0Richards said.\nShe\u00a0told them she was there to learn the language.\n\"Nobody objected... so I stayed.\"\nKanatawakhon learned Richards was a professor at Brock in education and enlisted her help in developing curriculum for an immersion program he was establishing with his colleagues.\nKanien\u2019k\u00e9ha is a polysynthetic language. It is also a verb-based language unlike English which relies heavily on nouns. \n \n(Candace Maracle/CBC)\n\"David was remarkable in that respect, because he was one of the first Mohawk teachers who understood that teaching vocabulary isn't enough,\" Richards said.\u00a0\n\"He understood that it was very important to learn how to make sentences.\"\nIn the 1990s Kanatawakhon taught at Western University\u00a0in London, Ont.,\u00a0Six Nations Polytechnic and the Indigenous Education Institute on Six Nations.\nOwennatekha Maracle, Turtle Clan from Six Nations, took night classes offered at Six Nations Polytechnic, but said he didn't retain much due to the complexities of the language.\u00a0That's when Kanatawakhon realized change was needed in how language was taught at the novice level.\nGreen said Kanatawakhon advocated for the autonomy of the learner in Kanien'k\u00e9ha language learning.\nRather than simply memorizing a list of words, Kanatawakhon's root word method helped learners\u00a0craft words they wanted to say.\n \nHe was one of the first Mohawk teachers who understood that teaching vocabulary isn't enough.\n- Merle Richards\nOwennatekha\u00a0remembered seeing dozens of small pieces of paper arranged across a table in\u00a0Kanatawakhon's\u00a0office at\u00a0Western. Individually they meant nothing, but they could all be used to create sentences.\nTogether, they refined the root word method and developed the curriculum that would establish Onkwawenna Kentyohwka,\u00a0an adult immersion program in Six Nations.\n\"When I first met him, there were no second language speakers,\" said Owennatekha, adding that most Kanien'k\u00e9ha speakers at the time learned from birth.\n\"There's this enormous language revival taking place. All kinds of things are happening, all kinds of activities, all kinds of progress, all kinds of accomplishments being made, and it's all because of what he did.\"\nThe method and the resulting curriculum is used to help revitalize other Iroquoian languages including: Seneca, Oneida and Tuscarora.\nResistance to change\nInitially Kanatawakhon struggled because people didn't understand his method. He was criticized, Richards said, because people assumed he took an objective and analytical approach to linguistics.\nShe recalled\u00a0a meeting in Six Nations where he\u00a0discussed bringing his program to schools there, and how he thought he could teach adults Kanien'k\u00e9ha. He was challenged by a fluent speaker who told him the language has to come from the heart, ending the meeting.\u00a0\n\"They didn't understand that it was coming from his heart,\" she said.\nHow this mentorship program is helping Kanien'k\u00e9ha speakers learn from elders\nProgram helps families bring their children up speaking Kanien'k\u00e9ha\nRichards said speakers were trying to protect their dialects.\n\"But it's important to realize that a language is more important than its varieties,\" said Richards, \"You need to learn the underlying structures of a language, and David was working on that.\"\nMaracle said his brother was dedicated to the language, often creating resources on his own time.\n\"I don't know how many publications he had and he did everything himself,\"\u00a0 he said.\u00a0\n\"He never sought out any grants. It was all out of pocket for him.\"\nSaying goodbye\nSukiyaki \u2014\u00a0\nthe Japanese song that in part, influenced a Kanien'k\u00e9ha language revitalization \u2014\u00a0spent three weeks at the top of the Billboard music charts in June 1963. Sixty years later, on June 29, 2023, Kanatawakhon\u00a0died at the age of 70.\nHe was laid to rest in his hometown of Tyendinaga.\u00a0Kanatawakhon was teaching at Western University up until his death.\u00a0 \nOwennatekha delivered his friend's eulogy. In it, he spoke\u00a0of receiving an award in Kanatawakhon's honour.\n\"I believed then, and more so now, that his work in revitalizing the language should be recognized, honoured and applauded,\" he said."},

Now I just can't get enough.\"\nThe Ferreiras aren't alone in having fallen in love with the freedom and adventure of the RV lifestyle. According to the industry group Go RVing Canada, there are more than two million recreation vehicles on the road in this country, and approximately 15 per cent of Canadian households own some type of RV.\nRenting versus buying\nBut getting into RVing is also a big financial decision. The Ferreiras could afford to purchase a new unit outright \u2014 and their daughter still got to go to university \u2014 but others may decide on buying used, or renting. The Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association has an RV loan calculator on its website for those who will be financing their purchase.\nEither way, the first step is deciding what kind of RV to go with. There are many types, and their costs vary widely. A new pop-up tent trailer that can be towed behind the family SUV can cost $20,000, while a Class A motorhome is more like a private luxury bus and can cost upwards of $500,000.\n\"Whether you plan to rent or own, ask yourself these four questions,\" said Cyrus Irani, director of digital strategy with Go RVing Canada.\n\"How often do you plan to use your RV? Where will you be using it? What amenities do you need to have? And how many people will be using that RV?\"\nDozens of geared-to-income apartments open in Hamilton for women, non-binary and Indigenous residents\nWhat is NIMBYism and how is it affecting how much housing is getting built?\nOnce you've settled on the type of unit that meets your needs, renting can be a great way to test the waters. Options range from traditional dealerships to peer-to-peer RV sharing websites such as\u00a0RVezy and Outdoorsy.\nRenting can also be a long-term solution if you think you'll enjoy RVing, but won't have the time to go more than once or twice a year. A typical Class C motorhome usually rents for between $1,500 and $2,000 per week, and comes fully equipped with kitchenware, towels and bedding so you don't have to buy all the fixings just to go on a road trip.\nIt's also worthwhile looking into one-way discounts. Some rental companies, such as CanadaDream, will offer heavily discounted one-way rates when they need to move an RV from one fleet location to another.\nIf you think you'll use your unit often, buying can make more financial sense than renting, said Shane Devenish, president of the Canadian RV Association. But he cautioned you should budget for other expenses beyond the purchase price, including fuel, maintenance, and storage fees.\n\"Don't forget insurance and maybe some extended warranty,\"\u00a0Devenish said. \"And there's the upkeep you need to do regularly on an RV just to make sure that it stays a home on wheels, so to speak.\"\nLower\u00a0vacation costs\nMany enthusiasts believe RVing stacks up favourably from an economic perspective when compared to other forms of travel. It allows vacationers to prepare their own food, avoiding the cost of dining out, and skip hotel stays and airfares.\nA 2020 study conducted by research consultancy The Portage Group for the Canadian Recreational Vehicle Association concluded that vacations in tent and travel trailers cost 16 per cent less on average than driving and staying in Airbnbs, 37 per cent less than driving and staying in hotels and 57 per cent less than flying and staying in hotels.\nOf course, actual savings will vary depending on the cost of accommodations at a specific destination, trip length and distance.\nRV travellers can lower their vacation costs significantly by avoiding long road trips in favour of exploring closer to home, as well as by travelling during the spring and fall shoulder seasons instead of the peak summer period.\nShe couldn't find a rental in N.L. So she spent 2 years living in a 20-foot RV\nMore people living in RVs on Vernon, B.C., streets because they can't find a home, housing advocates say\nIrani said it's also worthwhile checking with your RV dealer for campground recommendations. The dealer may have relationships with certain campground operators that offer reduced rates.\nRVing is a luxury, not a necessity, said Nikki Ferreira, who suggested sitting down and seriously crunching the numbers before getting carried away by dreams of the open road.\n\"I definitely don't recommend an impulse decision, like we made,\" she said.\nStill, Ferreira said the advantage of RVing is that you can decide whether you want to pop over to the nearby lake with a gently-used mini teardrop trailer for the weekend, or travel across North America for months in a giant home on wheels.\n\"You're the one who gets to design your travel and what you experience,\" she said.\n\"So keep an open mind. Because you can do it as glamorously or as rustically as you want to. And I do think it's an adventure everyone should experience.\""},

The CRA letter, dated June 1, said she was ineligible for the CERB because she didn't earn at least $5,000 in the 12 months before the pandemic, which is the income threshold first established under the program.\nBut the letter from Service Canada, dated June 22, says she did meet the income threshold.\n\"Based on the information we have on file regarding your earnings, we confirm you have met the earnings eligibility requirement,\" the letter from Service Canada reads.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) headquarters Connaught Building is pictured in Ottawa on Monday, Aug. 17, 2020.\n \n(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\nBuchanan said she's spent hours calling both the CRA and Service Canada trying to get some clarity, but is still without a concrete answer.\n\"I'm beyond frustrated,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have to be calling every day and pleading with them.\"\nKatrina Miller, executive director of Canadians for Tax Fairness, said issues like Buchanan's were bound to happen given the speed with which CERB was rolled out. But she said the government should take more responsibility in resolving those issues.\n\"Right now, the onus seems to be on the individuals to sort out the often confusing information they get from the government,\" Miller said.\nAuditor general says $4.6B sent to ineligible individuals\nLast year, Auditor General Karen Hogan found that roughly $4.6 billion in pandemic benefits had been\u00a0sent to ineligible individuals. She also said that more than $15 billion in Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) payments should be further investigated to ensure they were\u00a0sent to eligible businesses.\nBob Hamilton, the CRA commissioner, told a House committee in January that he disagreed with Hogan's assessment of the CEWS payments. He said it \"wouldn't be worth the effort\" to probe the $15 billion\u00a0the auditor general flagged.\nMiller said she's confused why the CRA is taking a \"draconian\" approach to individuals while seemingly ignoring large businesses.\n\"Having the government \u2026 choose to go after small individual taxpayers for $4.6 billion,\u00a0which is a lot of money,\u00a0but completely ignore potential ineligibility of CEWS for $15 billion,\u00a0which is three times the amount \u2014\u00a0that doesn't make any sense,\" she said.\nScrutiny of CRA push to collect on overpaid COVID benefits welcome: minister's office\nCRA holding back tax refunds from people it says received pandemic benefits by mistake\nCBC reached out to both Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough, who is responsible for Service Canada, and Minister of National Revenue Diane Lebouthillier for comment. Both ministers'\u00a0offices referred CBC to the CRA, and\u00a0Lebouthillier's spokesperson said the Income Tax Act prevents her from commenting on specific cases.\nA CRA spokesperson told CBC on Thursday that taxpayers can ask that\u00a0their cases\u00a0be reviewed by the CRA.\n\"We want to help impacted individuals resolve any issues and our agents will work with them on a case-by-case basis,\" the spokesperson said in an email.\nThe spokesperson also said the CRA is investigating CEWS recipients deemed \"high-risk\" but has found a high degree of compliance with the program's eligibility rules.\nFrancois Boileau, Canada's taxpayers' ombudsperson, told CBC he hasn't yet heard complaints from people like Buchanan who are getting mixed messages about their eligibility. He said Canadians can reach out to his office if they are having such issues, but urged them to try to\u00a0resolve them with the departments first.\nBoileau's office has been hit with dozens of complaints from Canadians who say the CRA took their tax return this spring even though they paid back their outstanding debts.\nThe office is facing a backlog and is currently trying to address complaints it received in early June. Still, Boileau encouraged Canadians to reach out if they're having issues."},

Among the changes, 68 acute mental health beds will move from Windsor Regional Hospital to HDGH, and\u00a0open an urgent psychiatric crisis service and other programs."},

Instead, we just would learned how to be sneaky.\"\nRogelberg says he appreciates what Shopify was trying to do, but he says the solution to a lack of productivity\u00a0isn't just cancelling meetings.\u00a0\n\"I also believe that there should be some retraction in the sheer number of meetings, but ultimately their solution doesn't actually solve the fundamental problem with meetings.\"\nHow to do meetings better\nRogelberg says getting better at meetings isn't just a quick fix. He says it takes multiple changes\u00a0and a shift in focus.\u00a0\nHe notes that there are\u00a0simple ways for companies to improve\u00a0meetings\u00a0and use employees' time more efficiently.\nHe suggests taking a look at who's invited to each meeting. In many cases, he says, there are too many people present.\u00a0\nRogelberg says one simple solution to improving meetings is reducing how many people are invited. \n \n(Josep Suria/Shutterstock)\nThis often comes out of a desire to be more inclusive, Rogelberg says, but it can also just be laziness, as technology makes it easy to invite more people. He says managers also use meetings to keep track of their employees and get updates on how much work they're\u00a0getting done.\u00a0\nSo sometimes it can be helpful to\u00a0cut\u00a0down\u00a0the number of\u00a0people\u00a0invited to a meeting, or let\u00a0some people leave the meeting early.\nRogelberg also suggests having a focused agenda that sets out to answer questions, instead of just a list of things to talk about.\u00a0\n\"If you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need a meeting.\""},

Otherwise, he said, he'd never be able to afford the cost of renting a one-bedroom apartment. \n \n(TJ Dhir/CBC)\nAccording to the\u00a0new report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, minimum wage earners need to work more than 40 hours a week, or earn substantially more than the minimum wage, to afford even a one-bedroom apartment, in every province.\nThe report used a standard measure of affordability: spending less than 30 per cent of income on rent.\u00a0\nThe analysis looked\u00a0at 776 neighbourhoods across the country, and how much people would have to earn in a standard 40-hour work week to spend 30 per cent or less of their wage on housing \u2014 something the report authors called the rental wage. In every case, the rental wage is higher than a province's minimum\u00a0wage.\u00a0\nWhile the disparity between minimum wages and rental prices is particularly high in major centres like Toronto and Vancouver \u2014 in both places, even two minimum wage workers wouldn't be able to afford a one-bedroom apartment without spending more than 30 per cent on housing\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 the report found the costs are rising in all cities the report examined, including Windsor.\u00a0\n\"Unfortunately, things did not get better and the trend continues towards a lack of affordability,\" said Ricardo Tranjan,\u00a0co-author of the report.\u00a0\nIn Windsor, four of the city's 12 neighbourhoods for which data was available were considered affordable in 2018. Now, that number is zero.\u00a0\nA worker would need to earn almost $19.50 per hour to afford a one-bedroom apartment within 30 per cent of their income in Windsor. For a two-bedroom unit, the necessary wage rises to $23 an hour. Earning minimum wage, a\u00a0worker would need to work 77 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment in Windsor.\u00a0\nJust four years ago, it was 50 hours, and\u00a0at that time the minimum wage $14 per hour.\u00a0\nThe minimum wage in Ontario is $15.50.\nWindsorites in rent-geared-to-income housing told CBC News they felt \"lucky\" to be able to afford their rent.\u00a0\nOthers renting market rate\u00a0units said\u00a0they sometimes had to put off necessities to afford rent.\u00a0\n\"It's difficult, it's hard to provide for myself seeing rent so high,\" said Donald Richard Lampron. \"I legitimately at times have to put off things that are a necessity in order to pay my rent.\u00a0\n\"It's a huge crisis here in Windsor, availability for rentals even at this point. It's becoming the next pandemic in my opinion.\"\nCompared to the last report in 2018, minimum wages rose over the last four years \u2014\u00a0but not\u00a0fast enough to keep up with the cost of rent.\u00a0\nIt means more workers are spending too much on rent, which in turn makes them at higher risk for homelessness, Tranjan and fellow report author David Macdonald told CBC News.\u00a0\nFederal NDP leader puts spotlight on Windsor man in calling for more affordable student housing\nMinimum wage couldn't land you a 1-bedroom unit years ago. Now, it's even worse. Here's why\nBut while high rent impacts workers, Tranjan said it can also have wider economic impacts.\u00a0\n\"So there's a pressure on wages and there's also a pressure on consumption because if rent is taking too much of the money there's less money going around for other things,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"We know that low and moderate income families tend to ... spend a lot of [disposable income] locally: groceries, medication, shoes for the kids and \u2026 transit and and all of those things that are usually purchased at the neighbourhood, if not at the city level. So there's less money going around in these areas because rent is eating all up.\u00a0\n\"We know that has a negative impact on tenants, but there's also a negative impact on the other sectors of the economy.\"\nJay Shanmugam is the chief development and regeneration officer at the Windsor-Essex Community Housing Corporation. He said while recently released numbers about rental affordability are not surprising, they are concerning. \n \n(TJ Dhir/CBC)\nJay Shanmugam is the chief development and regeneration officer\u00a0with the Windsor-Essex Community Housing Corporation. He said while the numbers aren't surprising, they are concerning.\nThe Community Housing Corporation is working on a new development at 3100 Meadowbrook Lane, a mix of affordable and market rate housing. But, he added, their \"market rate\" is below the true market rate in Windsor. Other housing developments are also in the works, he added.\u00a0\nShanmugam said the number of applications coming into the Community Housing Corporation has been steady for several years, though the wait list is around 6,500\u00a0families right now. He said in the last two years they've been able to add more than 200 rent-geared-to-income rentals.\u00a0\nTranjan said the solutions are ones that have been\u00a0heard before:\u00a0controlling rent and adding\u00a0more non-market housing, because he said those units stay\u00a0more affordable in the long run.\u00a0\nAverage rent has risen by 10 per cent in a year\n2 months ago\nDuration \n2:04\nThe average price for a rental home in Canada is up by 10 per cent since last year, and even cities known for lower rents, such as Montreal, are feeling the pinch.\n\"I think the discussion right now is moving more to the political level because we're a little bit tired of hearing the same solutions and not seeing them implemented,\" Tranjan said.\n\"Right now we don't see a lot of that, not at the federal level or the provincial level ... We're moving in the opposite direction. So it's important, I think, to move to the political conversation because the policy solutions are known, it's just they have not been implemented.\""},

headaches for many rural residents, the owner of a hardware store in the south end of Ottawa has become somewhat of a hero for finding an alternate supplier.\u00a0\n\"The most common comment is 'Thank God you guys have salt!'\" said Omkar Atwal, owner of Leitrim Home Hardware. \"There is a certain amount of desperation because it's something they really need.\"\nWater softeners are commonly installed in rural homes and cottages that get their water from a well\u00a0since the\u00a0water may contain minerals that make it hard.\u00a0That\u00a0poses a problem for appliances, washing dishes and clothes and skin and hair.\u00a0\nMost water softening systems require a\u00a0steady stream\u00a0of small salt crystals or cubes which are\u00a0purchased in bags and added into a reservoir as needed.\u00a0\nThe current shortage of water softening salt is mostly due to \nan ongoing strike by 250 workers at Windsor Salt\n, in Windsor, Ont., that has now reached the five-month mark.\nCustomers searching for months\nIn the lumber yard of\u00a0Leitrim Home Hardware on Wednesday, Greely\u00a0resident\u00a0Jon Hewitt\u00a0was loading the trunk of his car with four bags of salt for his water softener.\nHewitt's been out of salt for months,\u00a0failing to find a single bag at any of the big box stores.\u00a0\n\"I've been searching and searching and just noticed today someone posted on the local Facebook page that the Home Hardware here had some,\" he said. \"I jumped in the car and ran down here to get it.\"\nHe added\u00a0he's buying a couple of extra bags to help out his neighbour.\nAfter running out of salt for his water softener months ago, Greely resident Jon Hewitt scoured the area's hardware stores before finally finding some. \n \n(Giacomo Panico/CBC)\nAnother customer spotted the store's sign on Bank Street saying it had salt and quickly made plans to drop by.\n\"My husband keeps asking me every time I go to the grocery store to buy some salt, but for at least three weeks the answer is always that they're out right now,\" said Jill Joseph.\u00a0\nLike many rural residents on wells, Jill Joseph has been combing Ottawa and the surrounding area in search of salt for her water softener, and finally found some Wednesday at the Home Hardware on Bank Street near Leitrim Road. \n \n(Giacomo Panico/CBC)\nTurning to a U.S. supplier\nWhile the current availability of water softening salt is often non-existent at many big box stores in the Ottawa area,\u00a0Atwal\u00a0said\u00a0he has more than enough to meet demand thanks to some research he started back in February when word of the shortage started spreading.\u00a0\nAfter initially determining the price for salt was too high from some producers in western Canada and Quebec, Atwal\u00a0reached a deal with the\u00a0Canadian distributor of Cargill Salt based in Ohio that allowed him to keep a comparable price.\n\"Being independently owned we're a lot more entrepreneurial,\" said Atwal. \"When we see the market situation changing we try to get ahead of it, rather than react after the fact.\"\nHe's now getting a truckload every three weeks and is even supplying a couple of other Home Hardware stores eager to restock their shelves.\u00a0\nWith mediated talks between the union representing striking workers and Windsor Salt scheduled this week, Atwal said that his intention is to switch back to carrying Windsor Salt\u00a0once the strike is over.\nAs of Wednesday, Leitrim Home Hardware estimates it has 1,800 bags of water softener salt on site.\n \n(Giacomo Panico/CBC)\nWater softener tips to deal with absence of salt\nIf you happen to find yourself in a situation where you haven't had salt in your water softener for an extended period of time, Reid Thornley said\u00a0there a couple of things to keep in mind when you reintroduce salt.\nThe president of London, Ont.-based Aquatell, a manufacturer and seller of water softeners, said\u00a0the absence of salt can foul the machine, meaning it might not perform as well in the future.\u00a0\nTo minimize that risk, he suggests adding a resin cleaner when you reintroduce salt\u00a0and forcing the system to go through a regeneration process.\nThornley adds that you can\u00a0also consider using alternatives to the salts specifically marketed for water softeners.\n\"If somebody is really desperate, then regular table salt will work to regenerate a softener, as will pool salt,\" he said.\nOttawa Morning\n7:32\nWater softener salt shortage due to Windsor strike\nAs

And we're continuing to tell this story for generations. Our kids, and our generations next, will always tell the story of these different places.\"\nHeimuli said her favourite stop so far has been at Angoon, Alaska \u2014 where Moananuiakea crew members helped local Indigenous youth launch canoes for the first time since the \nAngoon Bombardment\n of 1882 when American naval forces destroyed the village.\nAfter a few days in Haida Gwaii, H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba stopped in Prince Rupert over the weekend and met with representatives of the Haida, Tsimshian, Tlingit, and Nisga\u02bba Nations.\nThe canoe will depart for Campbell River on Thursday, weather permitting, and tentatively make several stops on the way, including at Klemtu, Bella Bella, Namu, Port Hardy, Alert Bay, and Brown's Bay Resort.\nDocumentary captures historic Tlingit canoe journey from B.C. to Alaska\nPacheedaht First Nation on Vancouver Island crafts first dugout canoe in 50 years\nThe crew will change over at Campbell River, Heimuli said.\nWhen she heads back home to Hawaii, Heimuli said she's excited to bring stories to her family and friends, including those of how hospitable people here have been.\n\"For these people to just take some random Hawaiians and feed us\u00a0and house us\u00a0and feed us until we can't eat anymore, and then sharing their special stories with us \u2014 it's been pretty amazing.\""},

The City of Vancouver's response to heat warnings and extreme heat emergencies has been to open cooling spaces and centres.\u00a0\nRyan Ness, director of adaptation research at the Canadian Climate Institute, says cooling centres and spaces should be a last resort option during extreme heat events \u2014 rather than the city's only solution.\u00a0\nThe City of Vancouver has 39 cooling spaces and 19 cooling centres open to residents looking to escape the summer heat.\u00a0\nVancouver's first cooling space opened in 2009 following a significant heat event.\u00a0\nUrban Heat\nLandlords in B.C. warning renters against installing AC units despite rising heat\n\"[It's a] stop gap Band-Aid\u2026 People who need [access to] cooling centres \u2026 are typically the most impacted by extreme heat \u2026 and often the least able to move themselves around to get to an emergency cooling centre,\" he said.\u00a0\nNess and other community members are calling on the City of Vancouver and the province to increase access to cooling centres and help seniors and vulnerable people\u00a0refurbish their homes with air conditioning units.\u00a0\n\"Many of our buildings, not only in the Lower Mainland but across the country, were not built for the kinds of extreme heat that we're already seeing,\" Ness said.\u00a0\nThe Early Edition\n9:35\nHeat Series: Cooling Centres\nWe look at the role that cooling centres are playing in the fight against extreme heat, and what further measures need to be taken.\n\"The long-term solution involves making sure that people who are most vulnerable to extreme heat have the same opportunity to live in as comfortable and safe a home as everybody else.\"\nIn June, B.C. invested $10 million to provide 8,000 free air conditioners to elderly, vulnerable and low-income residents over the next three years. In a related program, B.C. Hydro is offering residential customers $50 off the purchase of a qualifying air conditioner until July 28.\nTenants and tenant advocates have spoken out in recent weeks\n to say landlords are discouraging installing air conditioning units due to potential building damage.\u00a0\nBarriers for seniors\nAccording to the City of Vancouver's emergency management director Daniel Stevens, the distinction between cooling spaces and cooling centres was only made this year with guidelines from Coastal Health.\u00a0\nCooling spaces are public spaces, such as malls or community centres, open during business hours with air conditioning. Cooling centres are a subset of those spaces, and during a heat warning or extreme heat emergency, the city will extend opening hours, add extra seating\u00a0and provide bottled water.\u00a0\nDuring an emergency, Stevens says up to three centres may be temporarily opened 24/7.\u00a0\nFree air conditioners for some B.C. seniors and vulnerable people announced in $10M program\nBeverly Ho, the operations manager at Yarrow Intergenerational Society for Justice, says there are several barriers\u00a0to cooling centre access for seniors, who are one of the groups most affected by extreme heat.\u00a0\n\"It's tough for our seniors to access cooling centres because a lot of them don't seem to know where they are or when they're open,\" she said, adding alerts for cooling centre openings are typically online and come the day before a heat event.\n\"Sometimes the centres are too far away, or the seniors have low mobility or have trouble getting to the centres on hot days, so they prefer to stay home.\"\nHo says this can be especially concerning for seniors in social housing without air conditioning or proper ventilation.\u00a0\nSeniors are one of the groups most affected by extreme heat yet have the hardest time accessing cooling centres, according to advocate Beverly Ho.\n \n(Justine Boulin/CBC)\nShe says the Yarrow Intergenerational Society for Justice has taken matters into its own hands by checking on seniors in the area.\u00a0\n\"We go to buildings that we've identified as being too hot in the summer. So we would bring frozen water bottles, electrolyte drinks and pass out information flyers about cooling centres,\" Ho said.\u00a0\nShe says it's important for all levels of government to offer more solutions to heat events and commit more funding to upgrade social housing with air conditioning.\u00a0\n\"It's extremely unsafe, and a lot of folks living in social housing are elderly or disabled with multiple health complications, so they are more vulnerable to extreme weather events like this.\"\n'Increase in usage'\nVancouver's Stevens says it's not clear how many people access cooling spaces during a heat event, given the widespread use of the facilities.\u00a0\n\"We don't know who is coming to access the community centre and who is coming in to access the cooling centre. Sometimes it's a combination of both.\"\u00a0\n\"We do track the overall usage of those facilities. When we activate cooling centres and compare it to day-to-day uses, and we do see an increase in usage during the extreme heat event,\" he said.\u00a0\nAir conditioners in the windows of English Bay Hotel in the West End of Vancouver.\n \n(Justine Boulin/CBC)\nStevens says while the city is working on other solutions, such as planting more trees to increase\u00a0canopy coverage, there are limits to what the city can accomplish.\nHe says he often hears people request cooling devices be designated as medical devices or be subsidized by the city.\u00a0\n\"That's really something that's done within the provincial government and the health-care sector \u2026 that's beyond the capability of local government,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"[Instead, we are able to] support community partners, for example, neighbourhood houses, etcetera, to expand our cooling centre reach \u2026 [and] making sure we've got the right species [of trees to increase] the cooling effect in neighbourhoods.\""},

We appreciate the Minister for bringing this matter to a close.\"\nMetro Matters\nMetro Van mayors contradict Surrey mayor's claims they unanimously support her push to stay with RCMP\nOf course, the matter might not be closed: Surrey Mayor Brenda Locke said the city would \"explore our options\" in the wake of Farnworth's announcement.\u00a0\nIn recent weeks, as it became clear that Farnworth was likely to take this course of action, she also pointedly refused to rule out \nSurrey taking legal action\n against the province.\u00a0\nBut the events of the past few days show the limited paths ahead for Surrey if it wishes to prolong the conflict and attempt to get its\u00a0way.\nWATCH | Farnworth says city's case for RCMP did not meet the bar for 'adequate and effective policing':\nB.C.'s solicitor general orders Surrey to continue transition to Surrey Police Service\n21 hours ago\nDuration \n0:27\nMike Farnworth says the transition of policing in B.C.'s second largest city from the RCMP to the Surrey Police Service must continue \"to keep people safe.\"\nDebate today vs. three months ago\nConsider in April, when Farnworth made his \noriginal recommendation\n for the Surrey Police Service while leaving open a narrow option for the RCMP to be retained.\nAfterwards, Locke held a blistering news conference where she said, \"We have a choice,\"\u00a0and said the city still \npicked the RCMP\n. The RCMP expressed disappointment with the province. The National Police Federation said it supported Locke. The senior opposition councillor, who wasn't aligned with either side of the debate, called for a referendum.\u00a0\nNow consider the immediate reaction to Wednesday's news.\u00a0\n\"It's time to move on,\" said Linda Annis, saying the debate had sidetracked Surrey. The\u00a0National Police Federation criticized the decison, but also called on the province to prepare a transition plan with \"a clear and imminent end date for the Surrey RCMP,\" while Farnworth indicated he had the tacit support of federal RCMP officials.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Sim's statement reflected the weariness of many regional politicians about the five-year drama that has caused stress on their own police departments.\u00a0\nAnalysis\nWhy Ottawa's decisions over the future of the RCMP could impact B.C.'s own decision in Surrey\nAnd rather than hold a news conference \u2014 and get the camera time and sound bites that would accompany it \u2014 Locke only issued a statement.\nWhy the reduction in immediate debating?\nOne reason could be an additional three months of fatigue in litigating the same arguments. But another could be\u00a0the new rumours surrounding contract policing by the RCMP across the country.\nSurrey, B.C. council approves 12.5% property tax hike as policing decision looms\n\"One of the things that has helped [Farnworth] has been the affirmation by the federal government that they're going to take a very close look at the RCMP,\" said Rob Gordon, SFU criminology professor emeritus.\u00a0\n\"I'm not sure what Brenda Locke thinks she's going to be able to pull out of the hat, but it won't be very much \u2026 if it goes to court, so be it, but it'll be years before it gets resolved.\"\nFormer Surrey mayor Doug McCallum holds a news conference after the province's announcement it was ordering the city to stick with the Surrey Police Service, which was created under his watch.\n \n(Justin Boulin/CBC News)\nWhat comes next?\nIf it doesn't go to court, there will still be outstanding issues to deal with in the months ahead.\u00a0\nOne is costs: Farnworth reaffirmed the province would commit up to $150 million to help with the transition, but Locke's statement notably focused almost as much on the finances as it did on a potential fight with the province.\u00a0\n\"I will also be asking for a face-to-face meeting with the Minister to understand how he intends to compensate for the significant tax burden that will be placed on Surrey residents and businesses as a result of his decision,\" she wrote.\u00a0\nAnother big question is how the province will introduce legislation to, as Farnworth put it, ensure a situation like this \"never happens again\" when it comes to a process that must be followed if a municipality tries to change its police force.\u00a0\nProvince orders City of Surrey to stick with transition to municipal police force\nThe province has defended its approach to the last nine months, claiming it had to respect Surrey's policy desires before coming down with the proverbial hammer.

searching for ways to keep their homes cool and smoke-free.\nSince the deadly heat dome that struck B.C. in 2021 \u2014 which \nkilled hundreds of people\n between June 25 and July 1 \u2014\u00a0portable air conditioners have often been sold out and heating and cooling companies in B.C. say they've been inundated with requests to install energy-efficient heat pumps.\n\"We are getting a lot of interest from people that are looking at heat pumps,\" D'Arcy Michiel, who owns Salix Energy Advising in Prince George, said. \"They can make your house very cold.\"\nHeat pumps can be a great option for many, but might not be the right call depending on your home, budget or climate, experts told CBC.\u00a0\nHere are answers to some of your questions about the cooling option.\nFree air conditioners for some B.C. seniors and vulnerable people announced in $10M program\nWhat is a heat pump?\nHeat pumps are electric heating and cooling systems up to three times as efficient as\u00a0furnaces or electric baseboard heating systems.\nThey use the same mechanism as fridges, freezers and portable air conditioners to extract heat from one area and transfer it to another, instead of generating heat themselves.\u00a0\nThis means heat pumps can cool homes in the summer and heat them in the winter.\u00a0\n\"It's basically the same process with a heat pump or AC, but you're getting the heating benefit out of it,\" Joe Cherieux, who owns Controlled Air Heating and Cooling in Courtenay, told CBC's \nOn The Coast\n last Thursday.\u00a0\nAir-source\u00a0heat pumps extract heat from the air outside to heat homes, or extract it from inside and push the heat out to cool a dwelling.\nGround-source heat pumps draw heat from a heating loop installed deep below the ground, and push it back out into outside air when switched to\u00a0cooling mode.\u00a0\nUrban Heat\nLandlords in B.C. warning renters against installing AC units despite rising heat\nHow warm or cool can they keep my home?\nHeat pumps have improved in the last several years but they might not be the best option for homes in areas that consistently reach below -20 C, says Michiel.\nConventional air-intake heat pumps work best in milder climates like coastal B.C., but Manitoba Hydro recommends not using them below -10 C.\n\"As it gets colder they lose their ability to effectively heat the house,\" said Michiel.\nA back-up heating option like a furnace, fireplace or baseboard heating is advisable for extra cold days below -30 C, Martin Kegel, an engineer who leads heat-pump-related projects at Natural Resources Canada's CanmetENERGY research centre, previously told CBC.\nAsk CBC News\nWill a heat pump work in my region's climate? How low can it go? Your questions answered\nNewer cold-climate heat pumps can work well down to -30 C and beyond, according to one manufacturer, and might be a better option for regions in the province's north.\u00a0\nGround-source, or geothermal, heat pumps work even when above-ground temperatures dip below -30 C, because the heat sources they draw from stay above freezing year-round in most of Canada (just like in Sweden, which has made them very popular).\u00a0\nBut if a home already has electric baseboard heating, Michiel says heat pumps are generally\u00a0\"straight-across positive\" to improve heating efficiency and keep the place cool.\n\"If you have baseboard electric heat and you don't have ductwork in the house or anything like that \u2026 a heat pump is definitely the way to go.\"\nHow Sweden electrified its home heating \u2014 and what Canada could learn\nDo heat pumps keep wildfire smoke out of my home?\nAir-source\u00a0heat pumps draw heat from the air outside, but they don't bring outside air or pollutants into the home.\u00a0\nThey do usually have a fan or separate air handler\u00a0to move heated or cooled air around your home, which can have a filter added to it to remove fine particulate matter from wildfire smoke that may have already leaked inside from circulating more, Michiel said.\nIf you want to prevent air inside from getting stale while using a heat pump, heat-recovery and energy-recovery ventilators can also be installed to capture heat from passing air to be sent either indoors or outdoors.\nThey also clean the passing air of pollutants like wildfire smoke if the right filters are used, \naccording to Natural Resources Canada.\nPortable electric air filters and air conditioners also have filters to remove pollutants from the air, but they must be cleaned often and regularly to ensure they are still filtering correctly.\nBut making your home as air-tight as possible, including new windows, door frames, sealing exposed concrete walls and replacing attic insulation, helps keep the heat and smoke out in the first place.\nMichiel says these changes also have the bonus of making homes more energy efficient, whether you're trying to heat them up or cool them down.\nClimate change posing increasing risks to the health of British Columbians, new report finds\nAir pollution, including wildfire smoke, increases risk of heart issues within hours: study\nHow much do heat pumps cost?\nThe actual pump itself can cost anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000 depending on the model, efficiency and size of the home.\nLabour costs for installation also vary based on what, if any, changes need to be made to the home's electrical system to accommodate the heat pump or integrate it with a back-up heating source.\u00a0\nCherieux says installation ranges from about $10,000 to $20,000 depending on how complicated it is, the age of the home and the nature of the current heating system.\nFor multi-unit buildings like condos and stratas, labour can be extensive to ensure all units are integrated and the electrical grid isn't overwhelmed, he added.\nIt's much more expensive to install geothermal heat pumps, which need to be buried deep below ground and are usually intended to service multiple households that can share the cost.\nAs extreme heat gets worse, expert calls for access to cooling as a human right\nGrowing calls to extend B.C.'s heat-pump rebates to condos to keep vulnerable residents cool\nHow do I qualify for rebates?\nThe province, federal government and some municipalities offer\u00a0rebates for heat pumps that \nvary\n based on the size and age of the home and the type of heating system being replaced.\nBritish Columbians can qualify for up to $11,000 in rebates for installing a heat pump to replace a \nfurnace, oil or propane heat system\n, as part of a series of programs designed to reduce reliance on fossil fuels through \nCleanBC\n, \nFortisBC.\n and the \nCanada Greener Homes Grant.\n\u00a0\nThose replacing an electric heat system like baseboards, radiant ceiling or floor heating can get up to $7,000 in total from B.C. Hydro and the federal government.\nApplications for all provincial and federal rebates can be done\u00a0through \nB.C. Hydro\n.\nHouseholds in B.C. can access rebates of up to $11,000 when upgrading from oil heating to an air-source heat pump.\n \n(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\nMany municipalities like Vancouver, which requires homeowners in need of a new furnace to install heat pumps, also have their own rebate programs.\nStrata owners and renters or owners of multi-unit buildings, however, are not eligible for any heat-pump-related rebates.\nFor federal and provincial rebates, applicants must ensure they have had a certified energy assessment completed and applied for the rebate before work begins. They can request an assessment through their federally designated \nlocal service organization\n.\nPre-and post-assessments can cost around $900 combined, Michiel said, but there are rebates available for about $600 of\u00a0that cost.\nIt's important to read the details of each rebate and speak to a certified installer or energy advisor before purchasing a heat pump, he added.\nNot all \ndwellings and heat pumps are eligible\n, and the installation must be completed by a \nHome Performance Contractor Network (HPCN)\n to qualify for the rebates.\n\"It's a lot of fine print,\" said Michiel.\nWATCH | Ottawa announces grant to help Canadians switch to heat\u00a0pumps:\n \nOttawa announces $250M grant to help homeowners switch to heat pumps\n8 months ago\nDuration \n2:36\nThe federal government has announced a new $250 million grant called the Oil to Heat Pump Affordability Grant that is intended to help low- to median-income Canadian households make the switch from oil to heat pumps.\nWhat are my other options?\nMichiel says a heat pump may not be the most cost-effective option if your furnace isn't at the end of its lifespan yet or you live in a colder climate where you would still need a back-up heating option on very cold days.\u00a0\nPurchasing a portable air conditioner, which start around $500 apiece, for one or two rooms in the home could save money compared to installing a heat pump before the existing furnace needs replacing, he said.\nBut the upfront cost of a heat pump can be worth it for people trying to reduce their carbon footprints and cool their homes in milder coastal climates, where\u00a0energy costs for the pump are on par with gas prices.\nMichiel recommends speaking to a professional to\u00a0discuss what works best for your home, needs and budget.\nWATCH | Atlantic provinces lead\u00a0switch to heat pumps:\n \nAtlantic Canada leads country in green home heating transition\n1 month ago\nDuration \n2:19\nElectric and climate-friendly heat pumps are replacing oil tanks for home heating on the East Coast, likely thanks to provincial government incentives in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and P.E.I.\nPortable air conditioners are also a good option for people in smaller dwellings or renters, Michiel said. Those who purchase a qualified energy-efficient portable air conditioner can receive a \n$50 rebate from B.C. Hydro.\nIn a related program, the province is also paying for 8,000 portable air conditioners for \nlow-income, vulnerable British Columbians\n.\nImproving the seal around windows and doors, tinting windows and keeping blinds closed, can all go a long way to keeping cool without breaking the bank for smaller homes and renters, Cherieux and Michiel said.\n\"These are going to be your lowest hanging fruit,\" said Michiel."},

The world's first analog synthesizer, the Moog was\u00a0a strange and groundbreaking instrument, creating\u00a0sound via voltage-controlled oscillators, amplifiers, filters\u00a0and noise generators played with a range of controllers.\nIn that tangle of patch cords, keyboards, joysticks\u00a0and pedals, Garson saw his musical future.\u00a0\nHe shocked his wife and family by dropping \"like $50,000\" on one of the first Moogs ever made, Garson-Darmet\u00a0said.\u00a0\nGarson invested in a Moog synthesizer and started playing around with electronic music, rather than the commercially successful music on which he'd built a career. \n \n(Submitted by Day Garson-Darmet)\n\"We had no idea what he was doing. We were all very confused.\" Instead of Garson's usual melodic, beautiful piano playing,\u00a0the house was suddenly filled with the weird wailing of the Moog.\nOver the next decade, Garson wrote synth film scores, advertising jingles and music for television programs. His daughter recalls celebrities such as\u00a0Liza Minelli, Bill Withers and Doris Day coming to the house.\u00a0\nMort and Peggy Garson pose with an unnamed audio engineer in the midst of one of Garson's many projects. \n \n(Submitted by Day Garson-Darmet )\n\"I didn't really understand that these were famous people,\" she said.\u00a0\"It\u00a0was hard to tell the famous people from the people that my dad just pulled in because he thought they were artistic and interesting for him.

Just before he died, he played the classic\u00a0\nStormy Weather\n\u00a0in the slowest tempo ever, and it was \"hauntingly beautiful,\" his daughter said.\nHis gravestone in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, reads \"the music plays on.\"\nUp until his death in 2008, Garson never stopped playing and creating. Sadly, he never lived to see the success of his electronic music. \n \n(Submitted by Day Garson-Darmet)\nWhile his legacy isn't widely known in his home province,\u00a0his career path contains a lesson for young, creative people around the world.

That will be followed by a report\u00a0recommending a new slate of appointments for council's consideration, potentially as early as September.\nAppointments may reflect approach of past mayors\nThe appointments matter.\u00a0\nCouncil committees are key pinch-points that can speed up or slow down a mayor's policy agenda. So, understandably, mayors\u00a0tend to wield the power they have to appoint the chairs and members of those committees to make their lives easier.\nFormer councillor John Filion said Chow's motion\u00a0suggests she\u00a0may being trying to strike a more conciliatory tone than just installing key allies. It might also mean that when she unveils her choices, they'll reflect councillors across the political spectrum, he added.\u00a0\nFilion said former mayors Mel Lastman and David Miller did to try to keep the peace at council. Chow herself was appointed by Lastman as the city's child advocate even though the two differed in their politics.\n\"I expect that she will be including everybody who's willing to work with her and move the city ahead together,\" he said.\nFilion said the appointments process also has the potential to establish, or deepen, good working relationships among\u00a0councillors themselves, he added. Chow will want to minimize dysfunction at city hall to pass her agenda, he said.\n\"When people are fighting, especially when they're fighting over nothing, it just uses up so much time and energy,\" he added.\u00a0\nFormer councillor Joe Mihevc said Chow has two aims with the appointments: to strike a balance of power on council and to keep people happy. Neither is easy.\n\"She needs at least 15 or 16 people that are happy\u00a0and that\u00a0will support her in her agenda,\" he said.\nThere's a lot more on the council agenda, \nwhich you can find here\n, and CBC Toronto has taken a deeper dive into some of the topics. \nYou can also watch the meeting live on the city's YouTube page\n or attend in person should your schedule allow.\u00a0\nDrinking in parks\nYes, once again, city council will debate the merits of cracking a cold beer (or whatever alcoholic beverage you prefer) in a local park.\u00a0\nIn a proposed pilot project, some councillors have nominated several parks while others have not. It's also worth pointing out, based on the report, that the city hasn't issued a single ticket for this bylaw offence this year.\nToronto wants to allow drinking in 20 parks this summer.

By the same date in 2023, 66 people were injured or killed.\u00a0\nThe data also shows that by July 16, 2022, there were 221 total shootings and firearms discharges. So far this year, there have been 158.\n\"That's not to say there aren't parts of the city that have problems related to gun violence, these are often neighbourhoods experiencing social deprivation,\" said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Toronto who specializes in race, social inequity and criminal justice.\u00a0 \n\"The daylight shootings, and other violent incidents on our transit system, we need to think about these in context.\"\nOn July 7,\u00a044-year-old mother Karolina Huebner-Makurat, also known as Caroline, was k\nilled after a stray bullet from a gunfight struck her\n\u00a0while she walked at Queen Street East and Carlaw Avenue in Leslieville. In Scarborough, two alleged shooters and a bystander were injured in a\u00a0\ngun fight over the weekend.\nBut while the violence has increased anxiety\u00a0for many in the city, academics and advocates maintain\u00a0Toronto is a generally safe city and say addressing the root causes of gun violence should be the priority.\u00a0\nHuebner-Makurat, a 44-year-old mother of two, was killed on July 7.\n \n(Submitted by Adrian Makurat)\nOwusu-Bempah said when issues plaguing neighbourhoods that have been neglected start to spill out into areas less familiar with gun violence, that draws attention, he said.\u00a0\n\"We need to consider that we've just come out of a global pandemic. We have increased rates of homelessness and mental health that are present that many people are seeing, that might lead them to question their personal safety,\" said\u00a0 Owusu-Bempah.\u00a0\n\"Toronto continues to be\u00a0a very safe city by historical comparisons, by national comparison and by international comparisons,\" he said.\nHundreds attend vigil in honour of mother killed by stray bullet in Toronto shooting\nNational decline in firearm-related crime\nIt's also important to understand that year-to-year comparisons do not illustrate long-term trends. Averages need to be examined over five, 10 and 20 year periods, said Owusu-Bempah. On top of that, Toronto's population continues to grow, so the rate of shootings should also be looked at in that light, he said.\nAkwasi Owusu-Bempah is a professor at the department of sociology at the University of Toronto.\n \n(Oliver Walters/CBC)\nNationally, there's been a decline in firearm-related crime driven by a drop in incidents specifically in Toronto over the last two years, \naccording to\u00a0\nStatistics Canada.\u00a0\nThe federal government attributes the declines due to fewer robberies \u2014\u00a0a shift it says\u00a0could be\u00a0the result of\u00a0pandemic-related measures that have caused retail businesses to change models, with fewer storefronts.\u00a0\nMan charged in daytime Toronto shooting death, victim remembered as 'beacon of light'\nTrudeau government proclaims annual day against gun violence\nScarborough resident Louis March, founder of the advocacy group Zero Gun Violence Movement,\u00a0said declining numbers could mean efforts to keep people out of gangs are\u00a0working.\u00a0\nLast summer, the federal government provided Toronto with $12.3 million to address gun violence, which was allocated to community-led projects to prevent young people from joining gangs.\u00a0\nBut this is no time to celebrate, said March. \"When you have a daylight shooting\u2026it's concerning. What it's showing is that we still need to do some serious work in terms of leadership,\" he said.\u00a0\nExperience needs\u00a0role in policy making: professor\nThat's why it's important for the public to understand that general year-to-year statistics will not tell the whole story, said Adam Ellis, an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo, who specializes in street-related violence, trauma and criminology.\nTo truly understand the layers of how gun violence is affecting communities in Toronto, those with lived experience of violence in neighbourhoods need to lead research on the issue, he said in an interview with CBC Toronto. He wants to see more pathways for people who have lived through gun violence to enter academia and\u00a0policy making.\nAdam Ellis, an assistant professor at the University of Waterloo, says those with lived experience of street violence need to play a larger role in research and policy making.\n \n(Submitted by Adam Ellis)\nEllis himself grew up in Toronto's west-end and ended up in a gang. He says a lack of support and security from systems like police and school caused him to feel connected to his \"street family\", which he eventually was able to get out of, he described in an op-ed \nhe penned for CBC in 2019.\nEllis says police often attribute decreases in violence to their work\u2014 but he encourages the public to be critical of that.\u00a0\nIn a statement to CBC Toronto, Toronto police said that while gun violence was\u00a0steadily increasing since 2015, it has trended downwards since 2019 and overall solved rates have increased.

IHAP works on a cost-sharing basis with municipalities and provinces to provide temporary housing to asylum claimants.\n\"Our modelling demonstrates this should more than cover the cost of interim housing for the people who are currently being denied access to the shelter system by the City of Toronto,\" Fraser said.\nThe new money comes after\u00a0the federal government \nfaced growing calls from the city and advocacy groups to help cover the increasing costs\n of housing newcomers to Canada who have been denied access to Toronto's overwhelmed shelter system.\nToronto\u00a0has been turning away asylum seekers from shelters since the beginning of June\u00a0and referring them to federal programs after the number of asylum seekers in its\u00a0shelter system grew by 500 per cent in 20 months, according to city officials.\nHowever, many asylum seekers can't get federal help if their claims haven't been fully granted, leaving dozens of them stuck in limbo with nowhere to sleep.\nWATCH | \nRefugees sleep outside Toronto shelter after arriving to Canada\n:\nRefugees forced to sleep outside after arriving in Canada\n6 days ago\nDuration \n2:03\nRefugees and asylum seekers say they are being forced to sleep outside because of a lack of housing and adequate shelter space in Toronto. According to city officials, up to 45 per cent of newcomers who call the shelter intake system get turned away.\nMayor Olivia Chow on Tuesday called the federal government's contribution a \"welcome first step\" but said it's not enough to solve the problem.\u00a0Chow said senior staff from all levels of government met\u00a0Tuesday afternoon to discuss \"tangible solutions for shelter space and personnel.\"\n\"While we appreciate today's announcement, it will not meet the needs of refugees arriving in Toronto and across the region,\" Chow said in a statement.\n\"It may however provide a short-term stop gap.\"\nChow had previously asked for the federal government to cover the $157 million Toronto is spending for existing refugee claimant shelter spaces.\nThe shelter system operates at full capacity most nights. Of the 9,000 people who rely on the system, about 35 per cent are refugees, according to city staff.\nMany of those unable to access shelters in recent weeks have, at times, camped outside a city shelter referral office on Peter Street in the downtown core.\nHundreds bused to North York churches\nOn Monday night, several mostly Black-led community organizations and and faith groups organized buses to transfer hundreds of the asylum seekers to two churches\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Revivaltime Tabernacle on Dufferin Street and Dominion Church International on Shepherd Avenue.\nPastor Judith James of\u00a0Revivaltime Tabernacle\u00a0said the men now being sheltered at her church\u00a0are staying\u00a0in the facility's gymnasium, while women\u00a0\u2014 including some who are pregnant\u00a0\u2014 were put into two large rooms.\nAll of the refugees and asylum seekers were given an opportunity to shower, James said, and provided with food. Nurses were on site to provide medical care to anyone in need.\nBuses organized by Revivaltime Tabernacle church and local non-profit groups bused hundreds of refugee claimants and asylum seekers who were sleeping on the streets to this church on Monday.\n \n(Chris Mulligan/CBC News)\nJames stressed that the church and a small number of non-profits currently paying to house the refugees and asylum seekers cannot do so for long without more help.\n\"We are going to try to do it for as long as we can, but this is a very temporary solution for a very big problem,\" James said in an interview.\n\"We are in need of great help.\"\nPatrice Bigirmana\u00a0has been sleeping outside since he\u00a0arrived in Canada a month ago from Burundi and is now staying at the church.\u00a0\n\"Now, we have shelter.

Jean Augustine, who was the first Black woman to be elected as a Member of Parliament, has been advocating for these refugees.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford called on the federal government earlier Tuesday to give Toronto the $157 million Chow had asked for.\n\"If you bring new people in \u2014\u00a0I've been encouraging them, by the way, to bring new people in, because we need to fill 300,000 jobs \u2014\u00a0you have to step up,\" Ford said at an unrelated news\u00a0conference in the Niagara Region.\nHe also said he wants to see the federal government speed up the issuance of work permits.\n\"Shelters are number one, working permits are number two,\" he said. \"I'm going to be all over the federal government to make sure that they get these people back on their feet.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark said Ontario has increased funding for its homelessness prevention programs by $202 million this fiscal year.\nThe province has also increased spending on the Canada Ontario Housing Benefit (COHB), which helps low-income households with rental housing costs, from\u00a0$48.1 million in 2021-22\u00a0to $148.6 million in 2023-24, the statement said.\nThe extra funding for the COHB\u00a0will allow another 3,750 households to\u00a0enrol\u00a0this year, in addition to the approximately 17,500 households currently participating, the ministry estimates.\nMunicipalities 'can no longer keep up,' mayors say\u00a0\nIn his comments, Fraser drew a distinction between refugees who come into Canada through federal programs and receive housing support, and asylum seekers who find their way here outside of official channels. He called on provinces and municipalities to \"build in adequate plans into their housing strategies to address the needs of people who seek asylum in Canada.\"\nMunicipal leaders in Ontario, however, say they lack the capacity to support newcomers without long-term\u00a0funding.\nOntario's Big City Mayors, an organization that includes the\u00a0mayors of 29 cities with a population 100,000 or more, said in a statement the new federal funding announced on Tuesday\u00a0isn't enough to address \"systemic capacity issues\" municipalities across the province are facing.\n\"Municipal leaders are operating with a nineteenth century revenue system to respond to twenty-first century responsibilities,\" the statement said.\n\"This most recent influx of refugees has dramatically increased pressure on a system that is already over capacity, and despite best efforts, municipalities can no longer keep up with the demand.\"\nThe organization called for a new funding model to address\u00a0the need for emergency housing and other supports for refugees. It\u00a0also demanded to be consulted on\u00a0immigration targets, including for international students, and on the money and supports necessary to support newcomers when they arrive."},

Or maybe you love voting.\nHere's some basic information that might help as you consider your vote.\nWhy is this happening?\nFormer Liberal MPP Mitzie Hunter resigned\u00a0from the legislature in May to run in June's mayoral byelection, vacating her seat in Scarborough\u2013Guildwood after 10 years as its representative.\nHunter was not elected mayor\n, and the provincial Liberal caucus at Queen's Park fell to just seven. It takes 12 MPPs for official party status, which comes with a host of benefits like more money and privileges within the legislature.\u00a0\nWho is running?\nThe Progressive Conservatives were the \nfirst to announce their candidate, \nGary Crawford\n. Crawford is currently in his third term as\u00a0the city councillor for Ward 20\u00a0Scarborough\u2013Southwest and he intends to keep his seat at city hall through the byelection campaign. He was a close political ally of former mayor John Tory, acting as budget chief throughout Tory's tenure.\nThe Liberals were next out of the gate, \nannouncing \nAndrea Hazell\n as their standard bearer\n in the race. Hazell\u00a0owns a financial management firm and is president and chair of the Scarborough Business Association. She is also the chair of the Caribbean Philanthropic Council.\nThadsha Navaneethan\n\u00a0is the NDP candidate\n.\u00a0Navaneethan\u00a0came to Toronto at age 10 with her family as refugees fleeing war in Sri Lanka. She has worked as a community organizer and has experience in the non-profit sector. According to the NDP, her most recent job is as a human\u00a0rights officer for the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU).\nTara McMahon\n\u00a0is running beneath the Green Party banner\n. She has worked in the HVAC and plumbing industries for nearly 20 years, the party said in a release announcing her candidacy.\u00a0\nOther confirmed candidates include:\nAbu Alam\n, Independent.\nKevin Clarke\n, Independent.\nHabiba Desai\n, Independent\n.\nDanielle Height\n, New Blue party\n.\nReginald Tull\n, Independent.\nJohn Turmel\n, Independent.\nTony Walton\n,\u00a0Stop the New Sex-Ed Agenda\n.\nYou can also see the\u00a0\nfull list of nominated candidates\n\u00a0here.\nWhat could this mean for the major parties?\nScarborough\u2013Guildwood\u00a0has been a Liberal stronghold since it was created by merging parts of three ridings in 2007. After two dismal elections in a row for the Ontario Liberals on a provincial level, the party will be battling\u00a0hard to retake the seat and get its\u00a0caucus back up to eight. At this point, every single potential seat matters\u00a0for the Liberals.\nPremier Doug Ford's PCs likely see a solid opportunity in this byelection to build on their big majority in the legislature. As a longtime city councillor, Crawford has a high profile in Scarborough and you can be sure that Ford's formidable political machine will be fully behind him through the campaign. And the PCs do have notable support in the riding. A\u00a02013 byelection\u00a0(when Hunter first won the seat)\u00a0and the 2018 provincial election saw PC candidates only narrowly defeated, and the party took four of the six Scarborough ridings in 2022.\nThe New Democrats will be looking to potentially build on some positive results from recent provincial elections. In 2018,\u00a0the party was able to flip the neighbouring riding of Scarborough Southwest after 15 years of Liberal control and then\u00a0held on to it in 2022. It could prove an uphill climb, however. The NDP has generally struggled to drum up competitive levels of support in other Scarborough ridings (a recent counterpoint to this may be Olivia Chow's win in the mayoral byelection, in which she beat out her rivals in Scarborough and downtown.)\nAs for the Greens, the mission will be what it always is: grow the party from a caucus of one into a caucus of two. But if past elections are any indication, it could be an insurmountable task. Green candidates have only garnered more than 1,000 votes in two elections since the riding's creation in 2007. Last year, the Greens secured 745 votes. For reference, Hunter won that election with more than 12,000 votes.\nOf course, turnout will be an open question. Traditionally, byelections\u00a0see\u00a0minimal voter engagement. And one during the peak of summer vacation season? It's hard to say how many eligible voters will show up at the polls.\u00a0Scarborough\u2013Guildwood\u00a0saw a 38 per cent turnout in 2022\u00a0\u2014 below the provincewide\u00a0turnout of about 44\u00a0per cent.\nHow do I vote?\nPolls will be open from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET on voting day,\u00a0July 27. A full list of voting locations will be posted after July 7, according to Elections Ontario. \nYou can find more information here\n.\nAdvance voting runs from July 19 to July 21. There are three advance voting locations, \nwhich can be found here\n.\nYou can also vote in person before election day at the riding's returning office at 1250 Markham Road, Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. until July 26. On Sunday July 9 and 23, you can vote from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. and on July 16, you can vote from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.\nVoting by mail is also an option. \nYou can apply to do that here\n. Vote by mail packages need to be received by 6 p.m. on election day to be counted."},

He is in favour of Holyday's motion, with one caveat.\n\"I'm supportive of the inspiration of the motion ... to have a slightly higher bar, but I think we should be careful about how we do that ... so we don't introduce unintended consequences to exclude people who aren't of ample means.\"\nHeaps, who received under 600 votes, said\u00a01,000 signatures instead of the current requirement for 25 would be appropriate.\u00a0\nHe sad\u00a0this would demonstrate a significant investment in time to collect that many signatures, which would be more equitable than making the barrier to entry purely financial.\nToby Heaps and, unofficially, his dog Molly were candidates in the 2023 mayoral byelection. Heaps says he thinks making more signatures required to run would be a good thing.\n \n(Submitted by Toby Heaps)\nToo many candidates not good for democracy, expert says\nJohn Beebe, founder of the Democratic Engagement Exchange at Toronto Metropolitan University, is in favour of the motion, saying reducing the number of candidates would be good for democracy.\n\"It's basically a common sense step that we can take,\" he said.\nElections should involve serious conversations about ideas that are important to the public, he said.\u00a0\nToo many candidates, he said, \"distracts from the core issues or debate that we should be having.\"\nAt the same time, he said, this election saw several candidates in the top 10 per cent or so who put forward important ideas, even if they weren't going to be mayor. He says a system where there are only two to three candidates would not enhance democracy.\nJohn Beebe says too many candidates on the ballot isn't good for democracy.\n \n(Evan Mitsui/CBC)\nBeebe said if the number of signatures are raised, the amount the fee is raised by \"should be more connected to recovering the administrative burden for the municipality.\"\nA thousand signatures takes more time to verify so the fee could go up by a small amount, he said.\nA longer ballot has benefits,\u00a0candidate says\nRick Lee, a candidate who received 241 votes, said\u00a0raising the bar to entry\u00a0might have excluded someone like himself, who doesn't have as large a network to draw from heading into the race.\nIt's official: 102 candidates are running to become Toronto's next mayor\nSee how all 102 candidates fared in Toronto's mayoral byelection\n\"I think the 102 candidates, even though it was a circus-like atmosphere, it kind of drew our attention to the election, which was kind of needed,\" he said.\nEven though he never believed he would win, he said candidates like himself \"brought a lot of new voices into the mix that wouldn't have gotten heard from.\" Fringe candidates can also mean there is truly someone to represent all views, he said.\nIf the motion passes, it will be in the hands of the province to decide what a higher bar of entry might look like as they are responsible\u00a0for setting\u00a0these rules.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Melissa\u00a0Diakoumeas, told\u00a0CBC\u00a0Toronto,\u00a0\"The Ministry reviews the municipal election process following each municipal election to ensure it continues to meet the needs of Ontario communities.\"\nThe rules were already made tougher recently.

If we could get people to volunteer an hour or two just to help sort through that, that would be wonderful as well.\"\nEarlier this week, the federal government announced it would spend $97 million to help the city house newcomers. On Wednesday, the city and the province each pledged\u00a0$6.67 million as a one-time funding top up to the Canada-Ontario Housing Benefit to get more people into permanent housing and free up spaces in the existing shelter system.\nToronto city council also passed a motion, moved by Mayor Olivia Chow, that\u00a0directs\u00a0city\u00a0staff to open up 150 shelter spaces for refugee claimants, primarily by renewing shelter hotel contracts, and to find 100 more spaces in the coming days.\u00a0\nJames said the donations have been overwhelming.\nThe donations include food, clothing and toiletries. James said there is also\u00a0a need for brand new items instead of previously used items\u00a0and organizers are still looking for portable showers.\nOn its website, the church has posted a letter to its congregation, appealing for volunteers and donations to help the refugees.\nThe church says of the asylum seekers: \"Their journey has been arduous, leaving behind everything familiar and seeking safety and peace in a new land. It is our privilege and moral duty to assist them during this critical phase of their lives\u00a0and we cannot do it without your generous support.\n\"We urge you to join hands with us as we endeavour to create a safe haven for these resilient individuals seeking refuge.

She said she was spurred into action after seeing a TV news report of refugee claimants\u00a0sleeping in the rain in Toronto.\n\"It really upset me. It sparked a passion in me to find a way that I can contribute and help,\" she said.\n\"I just came here. Just get hands on and get in. The reason why I do this is because it could have been me.

But in a letter to tenants Monday, the property management said final repairs have been approved by the condo board.\nIn the letter, the condo board says it has approved the cost of replacing the problem pipes and will update residents once the work has been scheduled, but provides no timeline on completion. The letter also doesn't acknowledge how long the problems have been going on.\n'Super stressful,' says resident\nThe problem appears to be related to water pipes that need to be replaced in the building, which residents say was built in the early 1990s.\u00a0\nSeveral residents told CBC Toronto they started having problems accessing hot water in their units in spring.\nOne of the most severely affected tenants was a 24 year-old-woman, Morgan, who's on the autism spectrum and who has now had no regular hot water service for 78 days, she says.\u00a0CBC Toronto agreed not to use her last name because she doesn't want condo management or her boss to know about her condition.\nThe building, at 25 Grenville in the College and Yonge area, was built in the early 1990s, residents say. Water problems began to emerge in the spring.\n \n(Mike Smee/CBC)\n\"It was super stressful,\" Morgan said. \"I need a lot of routine and predictability. It was not a nice situation at all.\"\nMorgan said although her bathroom hot water was restored on June 20 \u2014 after 48 days without it \u2014 the work crew that opened up her bathroom wall has\u00a0yet to repair it.\nBut while the affected units now appear to have hot water in their bathrooms, residents such as Morgan still await hot water in their kitchens \u2014 a problem the building's property management acknowledged in its letter to residents.\nCity staff should be insisting that condo management restores full water service immediately, says Geordie Dent, executive director of the Federation of Metro Tenants Associations.\n\"The city has a variety of powers here. They have the power of persuasion, but they also have the power of remedial action \u2014 the city can actually step in and do the repairs and put it on the landlord's bill,\" he said.\u00a0\nCondo law expert Audrey Loeb, of Shibley Righton LLP, says the problems should have been solved much sooner. But as renters in a condo building, some of the residents affected can't directly approach the condo board for relief. \n \n(Mike Smee/CBC)\n\"They probably should be doing something like that in this situation or something stronger than what they've been doing; unfortunately the city doesn't always follow its own standards.\"\nIn a statement to CBC Toronto, city staff maintain \"The city is aware that the property management is working to address this issue and have been provided proof of plumbing repairs. However, issues arose again with the hot water in some of the units. The city continues to monitor this situation and take enforcement action as appropriate.\"\nCondo boards deal only with owners: lawyer\nAudrey Loeb, a lawyer who specializes in condo law at Shibley Righton LLP in Toronto, says part of the problem seems to stem from the fact that at least some of those affected rent, rather than own, their units.\nRenters don't have the ability to approach condo boards for help because they deal only with owners.\nAnd in many cases, she says, those owners live outside the province and can be difficult to reach.\nCondo owner must also pay up for tenant's disruptive behaviour, tribunal says\nAlthough renters can't appeal to the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Board to force the condo board to fix maintenance issues, they could look to the LTB for financial relief.\n\"You may be able to go to the Landlord and Tenant Board for a rent reduction,\" Loeb said. \"I'm really sorry for these people. It's sad.\"\nLoeb says Ontario should implement the same sort of system that Alberta employs. There, absentee condo owners are required by law to have a representative,\u00a0in that province, to liaise directly with condo boards when problems arise.\nOntario's Ministry of Public and Business Service Delivery, which oversees the Condominium Act, hasn't responded to requests for comment from CBC Toronto.\nToronto landlord launches $1.6M lawsuit after city gave stranger approval to rent her condo on Airbnb\nMore than half of GTA condo investors losing money on properties, says new report\n\u00a0"},

He also told them he had considered attacking other targets, including a different mosque and the Pakistani consulate, or using his car to run down Muslims.\n\"When asked if had hoped to inspire others to commit similar attacks he commented, 'In a sense ya.

IHAP works on a cost-sharing basis with municipalities and provinces to provide temporary housing to asylum claimants.\n\"Our modelling demonstrates this should more than cover the cost of interim housing for the people who are currently being denied access to the shelter system by the City of Toronto,\" Fraser said.\nCalls for action\nThat funding money came after the federal government \nfaced growing calls from the city and advocacy groups to help cover the increasing costs\n of housing newcomers turned away from the overwhelmed shelter network.\nFord and Chow said in their joint statement that they welcome the federal government's investment as \"a great first step,\" but say it\u00a0isn't enough.\nCoalition assisting refugees demands action to help asylum seekers sleeping on Toronto streets\nToronto asylum seekers moved to North York churches as feds boost funding for shelter support\n'That's why we are calling on the federal government to build on its stop-gap funding by fully funding the supports needed to shelter and care for these refugees and asylum seekers in the city. At the same time, while the problem is most extreme in Toronto, it is a challenge facing communities across Ontario. We need the federal government to deliver long-term province-wide solutions.\"\nThe pair also urged Ottawa to dispatch resources in Toronto to help refugees and asylum seekers complete paperwork and process applications so they can begin applying for jobs in weeks, \"rather than the years it can currently take.\"\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, left, and Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow both say the federal government needs to do more to support asylum seekers in the city.\n \n(The Canadian Press)\nChow's first council meeting as mayor\nMeanwhile Wednesday, Chow's\u00a0first Toronto city council meeting as mayor opened\u00a0with a motion about the refugee shelter and housing crisis.\nCity council kicked\u00a0off three days of meetings, the first of Chow's mayoral term after she officially took office last week.\nAnalysis\nIs Toronto about to get a makeover? Chow could set new tone with council appointments: experts\nIn her first week, Chow\u00a0lobbied the federal government for more shelter support for asylum claimants, some of whom had been left to sleep on city sidewalks as different levels of government wrangled over funding.\nThe motion, which was moved by Chow and seconded by Deputy Mayor\u00a0Jennifer McKelvie,\u00a0says that Toronto's shelter system accommodates nearly 9,000 people\u00a0\u2014 but of that, more than 35 per cent of people in the system are refugees.\nA controversial city policy, brought in under McKelvie, has seen asylum claimants looking for a spot in non-refugee-specific Toronto shelter beds directed toward federal programs.\nOther elements of the motion include:\nA request that the federal government develop\u00a0a refugee reception area that can provide access to services when refugees arrive, which is similar to what was done for Ukrainian refugees.\nThat the city manager\u00a0make available temporary shelter for a minimum of 150 refugees and further find locations for an additional 100 refugees after that's completed.\nThat the city manager to develop an outreach strategy to invite property owners in the region who are willing to provide rental accommodation to refugee\u00a0claimants to notify the city, so it can use the housing benefit to move people into permanent housing quickly."},

As part of that work, the city hired a consultant, Jay Pitter, to lead the community engagement portion of the project.\nWhile Pitter worked with the city, she hosted a live question and answer\u00a0session on Instagram and a witnessing circle to hear from\u00a0the community.\nTwo other community discussion sessions were scheduled for early 2023, but they didn't happen. At the the end of January, the city said\u00a0Pitter concluded her work and she had recommended city staff\u00a0slow down and focus on\u00a0community facilitators.\n\"This provided a natural pause in the project,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe City of Kitchener said it cost $3,000 to clean up red paint that as thrown on the Queen Victoria statue last month.\n \n(Aastha Shetty/CBC)\nStatue's presence hurts Indigenous, racialized people\nFounders of Land Back Camp, Bangishimo and Amy Smoke, say the wait has been frustrating.\n\"We were really hopeful that this conversation was going somewhere. We had worked with Jay on the hosting of the first feedback session with the community, it was a full house and we were really looking forward to the second and third engagement sessions,\" Bangishimo told CBC News.\n\"Now we're kind of back at square one and it hasn't gone anywhere. It's only become a conversation again because somebody vandalized the statue.\"\nVictoria statue in Kitchener's Victoria Park vandalized for 6th time in 3 years\nBangishimo\u00a0said they would like to see more Indigenous peoples at the table and lead the project.

There is also history to the residential schools and the trauma that happened.\"\nAudio\nThe future of the Queen Victoria statue in downtown's Victoria Park is up for discussion\nOnce community engagement starts again in the fall, Merling said she would like to see more consistency from the city.\u00a0Trite said she understands why some people want the statue to be taken down and why others argue to keep it.\u00a0\nTrite says she doesn't want the engagement process to be rushed.\n\"I think taking the pause is the best choice they made in being able to really take into account everybody's voice and be able to start those consultations the right way,\" Trite said."},

The wheat beer, a strong beer at 6.3% ABV, is refreshing, not too sweet and has a light tint from the berries.\nSecond, Four All Ice Cream is selling a special ice cream in partnership with frontline workers at Grand River Hospital, and it speaks to the spirit of collaboration that continues to define the local food-and-beverage industry.\n\"This summer, we're again making a lemon, lavender, blueberry ice cream. It was first made by Grand River Hospital frontline workers in 2021, and they named it Our Heroes Eat Ice Cream,\"\u00a0says owner Ajoa Mintah, adding that the ice cream so far has raised $6,000.\n\"Throughout the rest of summer, when we will be producing it, we'll again donate a dollar from each jar sold to the Grand River Hospital Foundation.\""},

So when he took on the challenging fifth puzzle at the 2012 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT), he was surprised to learn he was among the first people to finish it.\n\"I'm like, 'Why? I must've done something really wrong here \u2026 because there's no way I finished that quickly,'\" the Victoria resident told \nThe Current\n.\nBut Krasnick, 60, hadn't done anything wrong. On the contrary, he recorded one of the highest scores on what was one of the tournament's most complicated puzzles \u2014 among hundreds of competitors.\nHe said it gave him the sense that he belonged at these competitions.\n\"There's sort of this feeling you have to be brilliant \u2026 and you really don't. A lot of it is general knowledge,\" said Krasnick,\u00a0who works for the provincial government.\nKrasnick first started attending competitions\u00a0in 2007, and competed in person most recently in 2019. He hopes to return to the next event in 2024.\u00a0\nWill Shortz is in Montreal for the National Puzzlers' League convention.\n \n(Submitted by Will Shortz)\nHe said the thing he likes the most about competitions and conventions like the ACPT is the people who attend them.\n\"The irony of this is doing crosswords is a lone activity, but there also is a social aspect in that,\" he said. \"I've made a lot of friends, people from walks of life or places that I never would have met otherwise.\"\nAnother top puzzle event is being hosted in Montreal this weekend: the 2023 National Puzzlers' League Convention.\nThe annual convention, which runs from July 13 to 16, features several games and competitions, including crossword puzzles. It's the first time it will be held in Canada since 2015, when the convention came to Vancouver. (It was supposed to be held in Toronto in 2020, but that was cancelled.)\nWill Shortz, program director for the National Puzzlers' League (NPL), said crossword puzzles may be challenging, but solving them offers a sense of accomplishment.\n\"You have to put yourself out there,\" said the\u00a0New York Times crossword editor.\u00a0\"You have to be willing to take a challenge and you have to be willing to accept failure.\"\u00a0\nBias in crosswords: how women, people of colour and LGBTQIA+ communities are overlooked\nProfile\nSeven crossword constructors fighting for better representation in the beloved puzzle\nChanging with the Times\nShortz began his career as the crossword editor at the New York Times\n \nin 1993. He was the youngest-ever crossword editor at the time, and wanted\u00a0to modernize the crossword's vocabulary and subject matter.\n\"The clues weren't playful, the answers weren't modern. The average age of the contributors was probably in the 50s,\" he said.\n\"I felt that the crossword should appeal to everyone who's reading the New York Times, and that goes from smart teenagers up to as old as people get.\"\nOne of the ways he did this was by publishing more crossword puzzles from teenagers. According to Shortz, before his hiring, only six teenagers have ever had their crossword puzzles published in the Times. But since 1993, he's published nearly 60 of them.\n\"The average age of the contributors has come down to [the] 30s, and just the clues, I think, are more playful.\u00a0There [are] more modern references,\" he said. \"I think the puzzles are objectively better.\"\nWATCH: Meet the youngest woman to have a crossword printed in the Times:\nShe's the youngest woman ever to have a crossword printed in the New York Times | Across and Down\n9 months ago\nDuration \n1:27\nSoleil Saint-Cyr is one of the few Black crossword constructors to submit puzzles to the New York Times. She's also the youngest woman to do so!\nKrasnick said he's also noticed a\u00a0surge in younger people participating in crossword competitions.\u00a0He's seeing more young people at crossword competitions, and online\u00a0puzzles made by them\u00a0feature\u00a0more modern clues.\u00a0\n\"The things they put in the puzzles \u2014 especially the cultural references or music references \u2014 will be more modern artists who I may be less familiar than the older ones,\" he said.\u00a0\nShortz said the move toward more modern references in New York Times\n \ncrosswords initially led to complaints that the puzzles were too easy, so he upped the difficulty on them.\u00a0\nThat led to complaints that they were too hard, though. So eventually, he found a \"happy medium\" where the puzzles get harder as the week goes on.\n\"Monday is an easy, medium puzzle, and it builds up to very hard on Friday and Saturday,\" he said. \"My hope is that sometime through the week, there's a puzzle that is perfect for you.\"\nEmpowering tool\nAcross his 30-year career, Shortz has seen just how crossword puzzles have touched the lives of everyday people.\nHe recalls reading a story from an avid Times crossword puzzle solver who was about to have brain surgery.

I don't mean figuratively, I mean literally,\" Fife said during question period that day, noting people \nwere being left behind in April and May by weekend GO buses\n between Waterloo and Bramalea. Metrolinx\u00a0introduced \nmore buses along those routes last month\n.\nFife asked Transportation Minister Caroline Mulroney when Waterloo region could expect to see weekend trains.\nIn her response, Mulroney said the province is moving forward with a large expansion plan for transit to build a strong regional network.\nMPP Catherine Fife speaks during a press conference in August 2022. Fife has launched a petition about two-way, all-day GO train service between Waterloo region and Toronto.\n \n(Sabah Rahman/CBC)\n\"Kitchener-Waterloo is a growing area and that's why Metrolinx is constantly monitoring the service and ridership levels. And that is why just recently we announced increased bus service,\" Mulroney said.\u00a0\nThe minister also said Metrolinx is in talks with CN to use the tracks it owns on the Kitchener GO line \"to make sure that we can deliver the service that we have told Ontarians we will deliver.\"\u00a0\nBut, Fife noted, no timelines were given.\n'We\u00a0need to keep that pressure on'\nFife isn't alone in wanting to know where the project sits. Kitchener Coun. Jason Deanault brought a motion forward to the June 26 council meeting asking for the city to advocate to GO Transit and the province to prioritize the Kitchener line and ensure \"continued timely improvement and expansion.\"\n\"Having that connectivity to the largest centre in the country I think would be a huge boon for not just Kitchener but also Waterloo as well. So let's try to reach outside of our own region and bring people in from the GTA,\" Deaneault told CBC News.\n\"I want people from Toronto to come here. I want them to see what we have here, whether it's the Multicultural Festival or Ribfest. That's really my main concern is getting people into this community to showcase what we have here in our city.\"\nCoun. Aislinn Clancy said during the June 26 meeting that she \"wholeheartedly\" supported the motion because the Kitchener train station \"is so incredibly busy\" and she'd like to see more options for people to get between Kitchener and Guelph.\nWeekend GO buses between Kitchener and Brampton are so full, they're leaving people behind\nNew GO bus trips between Kitchener-Waterloo and Brampton set to start this weekend\nMayor Berry Vrbanovic said while track improvements have been happening, \"we need to keep that pressure on\" to ensure two-way, all-day GO trains happen.\nDeanault's motion passed unanimously.\nCBC News reached out to the Region of Waterloo to see when officials last received an update on two-way, all-day GO trains. A spokesperson for the region directed questions to Metrolinx or Mulroney's office.\nUpgrades along corridor underway\nThe \nprevious Liberal government said in April 2015\n that GO service would be offered between Kitchener and Toronto every 30 minutes on the Kitchener line by 2025.\nThe likelihood of that, however, is slipping.\nThe last update on the Metrolinx website about the Kitchener line expansion is from July 26, 2022, when improvements to the Bloor\u00a0GO Station and West Toronto Railpath were announced.\nMetrolinx owns the majority of the corridor used for the Kitchener GO line.\nThere is, however, a 21 km segment between Bramalea and Georgetown owned by CN. It's part of the company's main east-west freight rail corridor in the province.\nA 2019 business case report from Metrolinx notes the expansion of rail service between Kitchener and Toronto \"has been a key aspiration for communities on the corridor.\"\u00a0\nThe 2019 report also recommended a new GO station in Breslau \u2014\u00a0a \npromise made by the former Liberal government\n in 2016.\nIn the 2019 report's economic case section, it noted if appraisals began in 2018, and construction started in 2019, all-day, two-way GO \ncould open in 2025\n.\nA GO train pulls into the station in Guelph, Ont., on Wednesday, June 7, 2023. Construction of a second platform can be seen on the other side of the fence.\n \n(Kate Bueckert/CBC)\nA 2021 preliminary design business case report does not mention 2025 as a possible opening year.\nPhil Verster, president and chief executive officer with Metrolinx, \ntold CBC Kitchener-Waterloo in 2021\n he was not prepared to announce any timeline for the project.\n\"What we're trying to avoid is a sense of exuberance to over declare dates very early in the projects,\" Verster said at the time. \"We find it's much more conducive and positive if we declare dates when we have more certainty.\"\n'A massive undertaking'\nCBC News reached out to Metrolinx, Mulroney's office and CN to see what was being done to bring two-way, all-day GO trains to Waterloo region.\u00a0\nMetrolinx said two-way, all-day GO on the Kitchener line \"is a massive undertaking.\"\nThe agency noted it has to use CN tracks on the Kitchener line but \"additional infrastructure is needed to accommodate both freight and passenger operations and agreements with CN are required.\"\nThe Kitchener extension project will be completed in phases, Metrolinx said. The first phase of work was started n April 2022 and includes:\nBuilding a second platform at the Guelph station.\nBuilding a new storage track for maintenance vehicles between Guelph and Kitchener.\nConstructing a passing track near Breslau.\nIn future phases of the project, Metrolinx says there will need to be \"track, signal, station and structural work\" done on tracks owned by the agency and by CN.\nWhen asked whether it was realistic to think two-way, all-day GO trains would be possible by 2025, Metrolinx said: \"Further information on timelines will depend on CN negotiations concluding and contracts for the work being procured. Metrolinx will share more information as it becomes available.\"\nMulroney's office said the government is \"delivering on the largest transit expansion plan in Canadian history. This includes delivering frequent two-way, all-day service on key segments of the GO rail network, including in Kitchener/Waterloo.\"\nTransportation Minister Caroline Mulroney says Metrolinx and CN are working on deals to allow more trains between Kitchener and Toronto, but offered no timelines for when that could happen.\n \n(Tara Walton/The Canadian Press)\nMulroney's office gave no timeline for the project and also said Metrolinx is \"continuing to work closely with CN to incrementally increase service along core sections of the Kitchener corridor that are CN-owned.\"\nCN said in an email the company has a long-standing relationship with Metrolinx \"aimed at providing fluid and safe commuting options to residents of the Greater Toronto Area. We are in constant dialogue with our partners at Metrolinx and the Ontario government to improve passenger service in accordance with the capacity of our infrastructure.\"\nNeed to keep need 'on the radar' of province: Fife\nFife says the responses she's received on the project have provided no details and have been \"a complete and utter runaround.\"\nFife's petition says the provincial government needs to \"provide a firm funding commitment and a clear timeline for the delivery of frequent, all-day, two-way GO rail service along the full length of the vital Kitchener GO corridor.\"\n\"We need to keep the corridor between Toronto and Kitchener on the radar of this government so that it doesn't get bumped down in the various other transit projects,\" Fife said..\nShe says she understands bringing two-way, all-day GO trains to the region is a complex project, but \"there needs to be more options on the table for Waterloo region residents to get back and forth to Toronto.\"\nConstruction begins on tunnels to allow for added GO train service to Kitchener\nNew business case, but no date, for 2-way, all-day GO trains between Kitchener and Toronto released\nFife says the soonest she can present her petition is in September when MPPs return to Queen's Park, but for now, it's serving as a civic engagement tool that has provided her with thousands of responses.\n\"I want people to be engaged in this issue of connectivity between Toronto and Kitchener. I want the government to understand that there's a strong economic argument for this investment and I want them to prioritize this transit option for students, for businesses and for commuters,\" Fife said.\n\"The fact that on the Kitchener line, we can't get a Kitchener train to come to Kitchener on the weekend remains a mystery and no one can give me a very good reason as to why.\""},

There are issues of freedom of expression against the kind of\u00a0motivation to hatred and incitement to injure, harm or kill people and we really need to have some very deep conversations about it,\" Manning told CBC News.\n\"There is an awfully urgent need for action,\u00a0and our ability to create that urgency and create that action right away is going to be a challenge.\"\nHe said Tuesday's\u00a0forums were the beginning of an open dialogue the university hopes to have with\u00a0students. Manning said future community engagements need to be part of the university's\u00a0next steps, though it's not clear what that will look like.\n\"We're feeling our way through a traumatic incident, trauma that will last a really long time,\" he said.\n\"We're not seeking to put a marker in the sand and move on. We need to continue to talk to one another, and listen to our students and find ways ahead that make sense to them.\""},

She's been the MPP since being elected in June 2018. She announced in January of this year she was stepping down from the role for various reasons, including citing the difficulty\u00a0in finding and paying for child care, as well as a desire to be closer to home for her family.\nLindo sat down for an interview with CBC Kitchener-Waterloo's Craig Norris, host of \nThe Morning Edition\n, on Friday to talk about what's next for her.\u00a0\nThe full audio of the interview is at the \nbottom of this story\n.\nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nCraig Norris:\n What's in your heart? What's on your mind this morning?\nLaura Mae Lindo:\n\u00a0I'm feeling all the feels. Serving the people of Kitchener Centre for the last five years has literally been one of the biggest honours that I've had.\nThere are so many issues that we still have to face\u00a0and it's unfortunate that a systemic barrier that I was fighting outside of the system ended up being the reason that I had to leave. But you know, I'll just keep rabble rousing from outside. It's how I roll.\nNorris:\n You announced in January that you were stepping down. What has it been like in this role since you made that announcement?\nLindo:\n It was tough, but it was also, there were some good moments.\nPart of why I had announced early was because I didn't feel comfortable knowing that this was the choice that I was making and not telling the public. But I chose to wait until the end of the session because I was handing bills over.\nSo I was able to hand over, for instance, a\u00a0guaranteed basic income bill, hand that over to one of my colleagues so that they could keep that fight up. Ensuring that the seniors advocate work that we were doing prior\u00a0was also happening and just sort of making sure that there was a bit of a transition so that some of the voices and key advocacy areas for the people of Kitchener Centre were still on the docket.\nLaura Mae Lindo is seen here in 2022 with federal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh.\n \n(James Chaarani/CBC)\nNorris:\n Now it is important to note and you mentioned that systemic reason you left was centred around daycare and the\u00a0prohibitive cost of of daycare and availability of it. What have you heard from the community about your decision to move on?\nLindo: \nWell, it was interesting because there were a lot of people that were worried about me being honest about childcare being the reason that I couldn't keep going. But because I was open with the full story. Childcare, we already knew, was expensive and that was one of the fights that we had.\nA lot of the advocates that were talking about the need for accessible childcare were\u00a0actually really, really happy that I was open with that because it demonstrated that it didn't matter where you were or what you were trying to do, childcare impacts women that are just trying to be in the workforce, and every story that you have of how it has impacted us is important for the bigger movement.\nThere have been some people that have asked for clarity around what it is that I was asking for, and so I keep just reminding people that before and after care, your regular daycare cost, wasn't the issue. It was that I was a member living outside of Toronto. And so when I'm at Queens Park from Sunday, sometimes to start on Monday morning until Thursday, the cost of childcare that's overnight, the person that's stepping in, like that's a different kind of cost.\nAnd the flip side of it was that it allowed me to remind people that there were a lot of single parents that were thinking about running and that literally chose not to because they didn't know what would happen.\nSo if there is a silver lining, I think recognizing that the actual issue is that childcare isn't considered an eligible expense at Queens Park, it reminds us of who the democratic system was actually made for ... what kinds of issues they thought somebody would face to try and be an elected official. Childcare wasn't even mentioned\u00a0and so now that means that the fix is just as easy.\nSo I've drafted the legislation and have it ready for anybody who's willing to table it. And in fact, the Leader of the Official Opposition, Marit Stiles, just messaged me yesterday on my last day and she was asking for a copy of it. So I will send that over to her and see what happens.\nNorris:\n What do we lose when single parents decide they're not going to run for office?\nLindo:\n There are many different things like lived experiences that I brought to the table. I did not realize that being a single parent was one that people outside recognized.\nI had single parents throughout the\u00a0years that I was in office actually say to me that it allowed\u00a0for their voice to be at the table when it came to what affordability meant, because when you are the sole parent and you do have even one child \u2014\u00a0in my case it was three \u2014\u00a0people don't realize that that cost of living, like it's all on your shoulders.\nKitchener Centre MPP Laura Mae Lindo stepping down to take Ontario university job\nQ&A\nAn Ontario MPP will resign. Child-care costs a big reason why. This Guelph prof says that's a problem\nThat is one of those voices that you lose because there's nuance to talk about affordability. There's a nuance to how close you are to\u00a0losing your home or not being able to pay your rent that month or that kind of stuff. But in my particular case, it's sort of like a double whammy because there were already only a small amount of Black elected officials, and I'm also one of those Black elected officials.\nSo you've lost a single parent. You've lost another Black member at Queen's Park. So there are questions about who this system was created for, who would have easier access to that system, and what can we do.\nIf we want our\u00a0democracy to reflect the people, then you've got to make sure that you address some of these systemic barriers and it doesn't have to be like a\u00a0partisan fight. It just has to be a question that we ask ourselves in a decision that we make to change the way that we create that system.\nNDP MPPs Catherine Fife, right, and Lindo are seen in this 2020 file photo when they were calling on the provincial government to make changes to long-term care.\n \n(Julianne Hazlewood/CBC)\nNorris:\n What's next for you?\nLindo:\n I'm at the University of Waterloo in the philosophy department and at this particular time, entering that department after the violence on campus in the gender and social justice program, there's a lot in\u00a0store for me because that's a lot of sort of the root of why I was doing social justice work in the first place.\nSo I will be there. I'll still be in community and now I can take what I've learned from how the system operates in my time in office out into the world and sort of teach that out to people.\nNorris: \nWe have\u00a0no idea when the byelection will be for your seat. Premier Doug Ford has six months before he has to set a date. There are some candidates already in place. What's your advice to whomever will be the next MPP?\nLindo: \nMy advice is to stay tethered to community. I think that one of the reasons why people saw me as an effective elected official was that I always created a space to hear from community whether that was positive or not.\nWhen I tabled Bill\u00a067, the racial equity and the education systems act,\u00a0I had a lot of people that were upset about that bill. A lot of hate coming to the office. I was calling people if they were leaving me messages\u00a0and they were mean spirited,\u00a0I was calling to find out why.\nA lot of those conversations allowed me to understand that sometimes in the messaging that we have, when we're trying to do something that we feel is on the right side of history, the messaging and the way that we communicate that out is really something that we have to work on. And so I would have conversations with community members and things started to shift.\nI think it's important for us to make sure that we are reminded daily that we aren't there because of anything other than the people asking us to be their voice. So we've got to stay connected to community.\nNorris:\n Is this it for politics for you?\u00a0\nLindo:\n\u00a0I haven't a clue because I said no to [Waterloo MPP] Catherine Fife so many times before I put my name on that ballot and so it's difficult for me to say, 'Oh no, I'm done. I'm never coming back.'\nI'm not leaving because I chose to leave. I'm leaving because the system didn't allow me to stay. And so\u00a0I don't know what will happen, but I do know that whatever happens,\u00a0I'm going to take the advice from my daddy, who I lost in November, and I'm going to\u00a0just make sure that I put my heart into whatever it is that I'm doing, use my position of influence and privilege wherever I am to fight for community and just keep doing good work in the world.\nPremier Doug Ford has six months from the day the seat is vacated to call a byelection in Kitchener Centre, which means it needs to be set on or before Jan.\u00a014, 2024.\nCBC K-W's coverage of the Kitchener Centre byelection\nUnder the Election Act, elections must be called on a Wednesday, then held the fifth\u00a0Thursday after the date of the issue of the writ.\nLISTEN\u00a0|\n Laura Mae Lindo on leaving her seat as an MPP, lessons learned and what's next\n:\nThe Morning Edition - K-W\n8:52\nLaura Mae Lindo on stepping down from being Kitchener Centre's MPP and what's next\nLaura Mae Lindo is no longer the MPP for Kitchener Centre.

But requests for the figures, including a specific request for the most recent report went unacknowledged.\nOntario Health Minister Sylvia Jones, shown during a 2022 announcement at Toronto\u2019s Sunnybrook Hospital, says the province has implemented and expanded various programs to address ambulance availability issues.\n \n(Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\nJones has implemented and expanded various programs to address ambulance availability issues, from increasing funding for nurses to monitor ambulance patients so paramedics can get back on the road, to allowing paramedics to take patients somewhere other than an ER.\n\"Our government's four-part strategy to tackle ambulance offload time issues is focused on: returning ambulances to communities faster, providing timely and appropriate care in the community, facilitating non-ambulance transportation for stable patients, and increasing health care worker capacity,\" spokesperson Hannah Jensen wrote in a statement.\nVideo\nAfter ER visit, mom calls it 'alarming' that paramedics are held up for hours with patients\nOntario paramedics say ambulance response times are slower due to growing offload delays\nSeveral communities say offload delays and the lack of ambulance availability skyrocketed from 2021 to 2022. Some say it's looking a bit better for 2023, but more needs to be done.\nEssex-Windsor EMS Chief Bruce Krauter has been combing through his own region's data, and found that from January to May, code blacks and code reds -- when there were either no ambulances or one or two -- tended to happen between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m.\nHe ties that to the lack of availability of urgent care clinics and primary care during those hours, and has asked Jones to fund those services for extended hours.\n\"If we get some better urgent care, primary care, those code reds and blacks should come down,\" he said.\nWATCH | In 2022, Essex-Windsor EMS chief said\u00a0health-care crisis was at level he'd\u00a0never seen:\nEMS chief says healthcare crisis at level he's never seen\n9 months ago\nDuration \n1:14\nEssex Windsor EMS Chief Bruce Krauter says lack of ambulances available for calls in Windsor-Essex an emergency situation. Here's what he thinks will help fix it.\nJones's spokesperson said the minister is working with health-care leaders in that region on \"innovative solutions\" to increase ambulance availability.\nThe County of Essex declared an emergency in the fall due to long offload delays and code reds and blacks. On one day preceding the declaration there were no ambulances available for almost three hours as 26 paramedic teams were delayed at hospitals.\nThere has been some improvement since then, Krauter said. In October there were a total of 629 minutes during which no ambulance was available. In May that total was 173 minutes. But the local emergency remains in place until there are no more code reds or blacks, Krauter said.\nEssex-Windsor EMS Chief Bruce Krauter says data for his region indicates they were seeing the most code blacks and code reds between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. from January to May.\n \n(Dale Molnar/CBC)\nMore funding from the province for dedicated offload nurses -- who can manage ambulance patients in the ER so paramedics can get back on the road -- has helped, Krauter said, as has EMS putting a \"navigator\" into the dispatch centre to help direct movement of ambulances.\nReprioritizing ambulance calls under a new dispatch algorithm is also expected to help, Krauter said.\n\"Right now if you call for 911 ... and you say, 'Hello, I hit my nose on something and it's bleeding,' you automatically get an ambulance, lights and sirens to your house,\" he said.\n\"We're over-responding to calls and all that does is drain resources.\"\nDoris Grinspun, CEO of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario, says ambulance dispatch centres are mostly operated by the province so should be keeping track of how often there are no ambulances available. \n \n(Amy Dodge/CBC)\nIn hospitals, Doris Grinspun, CEO of the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario, said even with the increased funding for dedicated offload nurses \u2014 $51 million extra over three years \u2014 the money can't always be put to use because of general nursing staff shortages.\nThe health minister's spokesperson noted the province expanded that program last year to allow paramedics, physician assistants and respiratory therapists to assist.\nWATCH |\u00a0Paramedics under pressure and a city running out of ambulances:\nParamedics under pressure and a city running out of ambulances\n11 months ago\nDuration \n9:36\nThe extraordinary pressure on hospitals across Canada is having a ripple effect on ambulances and paramedics. The National got exclusive access inside the Ottawa Paramedic Service as it faces an unprecedented number of \u201clevel zero\u201d incidents \u2014 when there are no ambulances left to respond to 911 calls.\nOttawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe has asked the province to pay for 51 new paramedics to act as offload paramedics. Normally, paramedics are funded 50-50 by the province and municipalities, but Sutcliffe argues offload delays are a provincial responsibility.\nLast year, Ottawa's paramedic service spent 93,686 hours in offload delays. In Toronto, that number was about 300,000 hours, according to a paramedic services report.\nTheir mother died after an ambulance delay, but it's taken 20 years for change\nIn Waterloo Region, the amount of time no ambulances were available increased by 571 per cent from 2021 to 2022.\nOffload delays are a factor, as are an increase in call volumes and paramedic staff shortages, said John Riches, chief of paramedic services.\nThe region has increased ambulance resources and 2023 is so far looking a little better, he said, but it's \"not significant enough to celebrate.\"\nWaterloo Region paramedics and its three area hospitals are hoping to introduce a \"fit to sit\" program this fall, in which paramedics can leave certain stable patients to wait in the ER, he said.\nWaterloo region considers more resources for paramedic services to meet demand\nHospitals in Durham Region have such a program, and that along with additional offload nurse funding has helped dramatically ease offload delays and code zeros, said paramedic services chief Troy Cheseboro.\nOver the past couple of years it wasn't uncommon to have offload delays of four hours, and now most are under 60 or 90 minutes, Cheseboro said.\nCity seeks to triple new paramedic hires as ambulance demand soars\n\"We're seeing huge, huge changes with the work the hospital has done to try to mitigate some of these added pressures,\" he said.\nCheseboro said Durham has also seen great success with the community paramedicine program, which sees them provide in-home care and outreach to frequent callers and those who need help with chronic disease management. He would like to see stabilized funding for it beyond the current 2026 commitment."},

"m-card-1.6909954", "content": "Mike Schreiner says he's seen MPPs across party lines come together to do some great work, but that friendliness is at risk because of the actions of the Progressive Conservative government.\nSchreiner, the MPP for Guelph and leader of the Green Party of Ontario, visited CBC Kitchener-Waterloo for a wide-ranging interview with \nThe Morning Edition\n's host Craig Norris about what he's focused on more than a year after the June 2022 provincial election.\nAfter the Progressive Conservatives were elected in 2018, there appeared to be animosity at Queen's Park, with question period often involving yelling between the parties and calls for calm from Speaker and Wellington MPP Ted Arnott.\nWhen the pandemic hit, Schreiner says he felt the tide turn and there must be much more co-operation between the parties.\n\"I feel pretty proud of the role I played in that, both publicly and privately at Queen's Park,\" he said.\n\"But I think that the Ford government's approach to certain issues, particularly the housing crisis and particularly opening up the Greenbelt for development and just putting our farmland at threat, putting our green space at threat, has really amped up the partisanship at Queens Park.\"\nHe said he also has concerns about issues like Bill 124, which limits wage increases for Ontario public service employees and which the province continues to fight in court.\nHe said he plans to continue to \"hold government accountable while still working across party lines to put your constituents first.\"\nOntario Green Party Leader Mike Schreiner smiles as supporters clap during a press conference in Toronto as part of his campaign tour in May 2022. \n \n(Tijana Martin/The Canadian Press)\nTop issue is housing affordability crisis\nSchreiner says the \"biggest disappointment in the last year since the provincial election\" is the housing affordability crisis.\n\"It is clearly the number one issue facing people,\" he said.\u00a0\n\"And instead of delivering the solutions that housing experts have talked about, the government's own housing task force has put forward, the Ontario Greens have put forward a housing plan that many experts have said really delivers the solutions Ontario needs \u2014 the Ford government hasn't gone in that direction.\"\nSchreiner says he strongly disagrees with changes to the Greenbelt that will allow for housing to be built on lands that were previously protected.\nInvite declined: Green Leader Mike Schreiner won't run for Ontario Liberals\nNew housing law will mean big money for a few, higher property taxes for the rest: Mike Schreiner\n\"It's just so frustrating for me because the solutions to the housing crisis are right there in front of us and yet for whatever reason, the government's taken another direction that I think actually threatens the affordability and livability of our communities,\" he said.\nPrivate member's bills focus on housing\nSchreiner has two private member's bills on the order paper right now.\nOne is to remove exclusionary zoning to allow multiplexes and four-storey walk-up apartments within existing neighbourhoods.\nThe other is to make it easier to build purpose-built rentals along major transportation corridors.\nHe says he thinks both of the bills should be easily passed.\nExclusionary zoning bylaws are rules that prevent certain developments from happening in particular neighbourhoods. Getting rid of those rules would be \"the fastest way that we can build up housing supply\" and \"do it in the most affordable way,\" Schreiner said.\n\"It's increasing gentle density within areas that already have servicing\" such as sewer, water, hydro lines and roads.\u00a0\n\"We have to increase supply within our existing built up areas. That's the best way that we can create connected affordable communities, increase the supply of housing that people can actually afford.\"\nLISTEN\u00a0| \nThe full interview with Guelph MPP and Green Party of Ontario Leader Mike Schreiner\n:\nThe Morning Edition - K-W\n10:07\nSummer checkup: Guelph MPP and Green Party of Ontario Leader Mike Schreiner\nOver the course of the summer, CBC Kitchener-Waterloo will catch up with local MPPs to see what they're working on.

In Ontario, \nfor 2024, it's\u00a02.5 per cent\n.\nBut in most places, those maximums only apply to tenants currently renting a unit. Generally, landlords can increase rents between leases as high as the market can bear.\nThat's where vacancy control comes into play. P.E.I., for example, regulates\u00a0rental rates between tenants. The rents are attached to the unit, not the renter, according to the CCHR.\nA 'For Rent' sign in Toronto in July 2022. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in a purpose-built building was $1,258 per month in 2022 \u2014 much more in the Ontario capital and in Vancouver \u2014 according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.  \n \n(Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)\nManitoba also offers vacancy control, but only in buildings with four or more units.\nIn Quebec, landlords must notify new tenants of the lowest rent in the preceding 12 months when signing a new lease.\nFor ongoing tenants in Quebec, rent control applies if the\u00a0tenant refuses an increase within one month of receiving notice\n\u00a0\nand requests a review by the housing tribunal.\n\u00a0\nThe tribunal can then determine the increase, according to an annual calculation\u00a0that the tenant and landlord must agree to.\u00a0\nAre there exceptions?\nYes.\u00a0Landlords can apply for increases beyond the mandated limits\u00a0to cover changes such as repairs or upgrades to a unit.\u00a0\nThey can also evict tenants\u00a0if the property requires significant repairs or refurbishment \u2014 known as a \"renoviction\" \u2014 or if a family member needs to move in.\u00a0\nThere are good reasons exemptions like these exist, but they\u00a0can be abused to sneak in a rent increase, says\u00a0Mike Moffatt, an economist and assistant professor at Ivey Business School in London, Ont.\nExperts agree that constructing new purpose-built rental buildings will help alleviate pressure on the market. But some say rent controls discourage developers from building new projects.\n \n(Stephen MacGillivray/The Canadian Press)\n\"What [the landlord] might be able to do is say, 'Oh well, my son's going to go to school, and he needs that unit for a year.' So you sort of give it to a family member for a year, then the son leaves and then you can charge market rent again,\"\u00a0he told CBC Radio's \nCost of Living\n.\nThere can also be other exemptions. For example, buildings in Manitoba first occupied after March 7, 2005, are \nexempt from rent control for 20 years\n, as are units over $1,570 per month.\nDoes rent control help tenants?\nOpinions differ.\u00a0\nMoffatt says while regulation can prevent landlords from \"taking advantage of market conditions,\" rent control typically only benefits existing tenants. It can lead to higher rents for new tenants.\n\"Oftentimes, those rents go up [when] the existing tenants leave,\" he said. \"So it tends to advantage one group over another.\"\nShadpour says one solution is to expand\u00a0vacancy control \u2014 to \"disincentivize that form of rent gouging.\"\nWATCH | How high rents are impacting students:\nRent for student housing is out of control. Is there a fix?\n1 month ago\nDuration \n5:59\nStudents are being faced with higher rents and a shortage of supply and some experts say post-secondary institutions need to co-ordinate enrolment levels with the availability of housing.\nDoes it affect construction?\u00a0\nOthers say rent control discourages developers from constructing purpose-built rental buildings.\n\"In Ontario in the 1950s and 1960s and early 1970s, there was a huge boom in construction of purpose-built rental apartment buildings,\" said Tony Irwin, president and CEO of the Federation of Rental-Housing Providers of Ontario (FRPO).\n\"When rent control was introduced \u2014 coupled with some other tax incentives, federal tax incentives, that I believe were removed \u2014 you then saw purpose-built rental construction go off a cliff.\"\nA February 2023 report put out by four groups, including the FRPO,\u00a0\nbacks that up\n. It shows between 1960 and 1979, nearly 224,000 rental units were constructed in Ontario. That compares to fewer than 24,000 between 2000 and 2023.\u00a0\n\"Most developers and builders have a choice \u2014 that they can build something as a purpose-built rental or they could build something as a condo,\" Moffatt said.\u00a0\nIf there are too many restrictions on the former, \"developers and builders will say, 'Oh, to heck with it. I would rather just sell these as condo units,'\" he said.\u00a0\nBahar Shadpour, director of communications at the Canadian Centre for Housing Rights, says that a wider range of housing types are needed \u2014 not just 'luxury' rentals.\n \n(Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press)\nThough rent control alone doesn't influence development, Shadpour\u00a0pushed back against the argument\u00a0it limits development given historical trends. Ontario removed\u00a0rent control on buildings built after Nov. 1, 1991, an exception\u00a0that stayed in place until\u00a02017,\u00a0hoping that would encourage developers to build rental housing, she says.\u00a0\n\"And what we see across the board is that that didn't happen \u2014 developers still created condominiums and single-family homes.\"\nWhat else can help?\nThe experts CBC\u00a0News spoke with all agree that increasing the rental housing stock is critical.\u00a0\n\"We've been under-building for decades,\" said Irwin. \"There's such a huge shortage of housing generally, and rental housing specifically, that is putting a huge pressure on rents.\n\"It is a supply and demand conversation.\"\nProviding incentives, such as tax breaks, to developers will help spur new construction, Moffatt and Shadpour say.\u00a0\nAs rents soar, tenants organize local protests. But what's needed for a national housing movement?\nMinimum wage couldn't land you a 1-bedroom unit years ago. Now, it's even worse. Here's why\nCBC Explains\nWhat are rent strikes \u2014 and do they work?\nMeanwhile, municipalities need to streamline approvals so builders can get construction done in a timely fashion, Irwin says.\nAnd, as housing prices show no sign of slowing down, Shadpour says developers need to prioritize more accessible options.\n\"We can't have any more luxury purpose-built rentals. People can't afford it.\"\u00a0"},

For more information about CBC's First Person stories, please see \nthe FAQ\n.\nIt was a typical Monday morning. Almost.\nMy kids were sitting at the breakfast counter while getting ready for summer school, however, there was an unusual silence in the air. Without hesitation, I began addressing the elephant in the room.\nThe conversation we had revolved around how to stay safe in case they ever found themselves in a dangerous situation. It wasn't the first time we had discussed safety, but this time was different.\nJust a few days prior, my boys experienced first-hand the chaos and fear that erupted after a \npassenger was stabbed on the Toronto subway\n. The incident took place dangerously close to our home, inside Eglinton Station in the heart of midtown Toronto. That proximity made the situation even more unsettling for all of us.\nMy children were on a train that was heading toward\u00a0Eglinton. Thankfully, their train did not stop there and for that, the driver held the top spot in the July 6 entry in my gratitude journal.\n\"I will be late, Ma! The train did not stop at Eglinton station because of some security incident,\" said my 13-year-old son when he called me.\nI could sense fear and confusion in his voice and, as he spoke, I started noticing the sound of sirens in the distance. At that moment, I wasn't sure if they were police cars or where they were going. The minute it dawned on me that they were all heading toward Eglinton Station, my heart began to race with worry and fear. We later learned that my elder son, with a calmness beyond his years, had gotten off at the next station, holding his 10-year-old brother's hand tightly so as not to\u00a0lose him in the crowd.\n Jagannathan\u2019s sons, age 13 and 10, were supposed to get off at the Eglinton Station when the Toronto Transit Commission ordered drivers to bypass the station.\n \n(Laura Pedersen/CBC)\nSoon, he called me back. The buses were crowded and he said he was scared to get on. I found it unusual, given his comfort\u00a0with public transit. Then two Uber drivers I had booked refused to give them a ride. At that moment, my partner stepped in, taking on the longest eight minutes of our lives as he drove to pick them up.\nOnce they were safely in the car, I learned that my older son started crying. He repeatedly expressed his worry, asking, \"What if I had lost my brother in the crowd?\"\u00a0\nWhile an arrest has been made, the emotional impact lingered within our family for days and for many sleepless nights. The haunting questions \u2014 \"What if they'd been on the other train? What if the stabbing had happened on theirs?\" \u2014 replayed in my mind.\nThe day after, my children made the decision to stay home and avoid going to summer camp.\u00a0But we needed to move forward.\nMy children rely on public transit and use it every day. I am proud of their independence and their love for trains.\nAt breakfast on Monday morning, while they ate their freshly made \ndosas \n\u2014 a savoury crepe that is a staple breakfast dish among South Indians \u2014 we again went over the safety guidelines.\nI emphasized remaining alert and aware of their surroundings, maintaining a safe distance from the platform's edge, learning the emergency exits and not hesitating to seek assistance from staff or security. In the event of a dangerous situation, I asked them to stick together, call me immediately and note the location to let me know where they are.\nWith a very heavy heart, I added that in the event of gunshots, they must immediately take cover.\nUnlike their talkative selves, my sons listened without interruption. After an uncomfortable silence, my younger son spoke up. \"Mom, I understand how to avoid fights with people.\u00a0But how can I protect myself from random acts of violence where people are targeted for no reason?\" I found myself speechless.\nJagannathan's sons, shown above, use the city's transit system regularly to get around. Though she worries about their safety, she says she's made sure to equip them with strategies to stay safe.\n \n(Rajeev Bindiganavale Ramagopal)\nHow can I explain why there was a shooting, apparently unprovoked, near his father's office in downtown Toronto the following day? Or another \nshooting incident near Bloor and Yonge\n in the early morning of the same day.\nWe moved to Canada a couple of years ago and chose a home near Eglinton Station. We'd heard it had a low crime rate and convenient public transportation, but above all, we love the hustle and bustle of the community.\u00a0\nWitnessing such events unfold in my own backyard served as a stark reminder that safety can never be taken for granted.\nAs a mother, I have always taken pride in finding the balance between being a helicopter parent and a hands-off one. But this had disrupted that delicate equilibrium.\nThe realization that I wouldn't always be there to protect them threw me on an emotional roller-coaster. I wished I could shrink them back to the safety of my womb, shielding them from violence and bloodshed.\nIn the aftermath of this experience, I have learned to appreciate the simple act of sharing breakfast together even more.\u00a0\nMistake not, I still carry a heavy heart.

Haze so thick the street lamps glow hours before dusk.\nAir pollution from wildfires has become an unwelcome part of summer in Alberta and this season has been particularly poor, rivalling the worst years on record for Edmonton and Calgary.\nSmoke has choked the skies over Alberta this week, triggering high-risk air pollution that forced people to cancel their outdoor plans and hunker down inside.\u00a0\nA few more hazy days could make this wildfire season a record-breaker for Edmonton and Calgary, as experts caution that smoky summers fed by longer, more intense wildfire seasons will become the norm.\n\"It's not a good story here or a happy story,\" said Natalie Hasell, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment Canada.\n\"The people who are susceptible to smoke are the same people, more or less, who are susceptible to heat.\n\"And we have seen a number of times already this year where both have happened at the same time. That could easily happen again in the not-so-far future for Alberta.\"\nTracking 'smoke hours'\nFor the past 70 years, Environment Canada has tracked \"smoke hours\" for communities across the country. Smoke hours are counted when the haze from wildfires is so thick that visibility is reduced to 9.7 kilometres or less.\u00a0\nThe smokiest year on record for both Edmonton and Calgary was 2018. Between May and September of that year, Edmonton recorded 229 smoke hours.\nBetween May 1 and July 17 of this year, Edmonton has already recorded 194 smoke hours, already the second-highest number of hours on record.\n\"By the end of this season we might not be in second place anymore, if this year continues the way it has been,\" Hasell said in an interview Monday.\nIn 2018, Calgary recorded 450 smoke hours between May and September.\u00a0 To date this year, the city has seen 258 smoke hours, the fourth highest year on record.\nAlberta spent the weekend under a blanket of smoke with air pollution measured\u00a0at a 10-plus on the Air Quality Health Index.\nDeveloped by Health Canada, the system monitors\u00a0the severity of air pollution by tracking fine particulate matter, ground-level ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. When the rating is high, people exposed to the smog face significant health risks.\nThe haze lifted on Monday but the clearer skies are not expected to last. Heavy rains\u00a0Tuesday will be followed by a return to hot, dry weather that is expected to fuel fires burning across the west.\n\"We do see another long stretch of hotter and drier conditions coming,\" Hasell said.\u00a0\"This could be a very short-lived reprieve, unfortunately.\"\nCheck the\u00a0\nCBC News Climate Dashboard\n\u00a0for live updates on wildfire smoke and active fires across the country.\nThis season has been historic for wildfires across the Prairies, and air quality advisories have been triggered repeatedly as smoke from fires burning across the country drifts across the province.\nA summer heat wave fuelled an early start for the wildfire season.\u00a0\nExperts say climate change is driving the shift. Weather conditions in all seasons are growing more extreme and fire activity continues to intensify, allowing fires to start earlier each spring and burn longer into the fall.\nCBC Explains\nHow to better protect yourself from the health effects of wildfire smoke\nBoy, 9, died of asthma attack made worse by wildfire smoke, parents say\nAir-quality expert Michael Brauer, a professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia, said persistent exposure to smoke will pose an increasing risk to public health.\n\"Even if we're otherwise healthy and we're not feeling symptoms, it's this cumulative effect over the course of our lifetime that we may be facing,\" he said.\nThe health effects of smoke can be fatal and ongoing exposure to smoke every season will accelerate the progression of illnesses such as lung and heart disease, he said.\u00a0\n\"What about a long smoke season this summer, and then next summer, and every summer thereafter? And that's really the era that we're getting into with this warming climate.\n\"All the suggestions that we have point to this being similar to what we know from general air pollution, which means that it leads to life-shortening. Basically, people will not live as long.\"\nAs poor air quality continues to plague Alberta's summer season, experts are warning of the risks of persistent exposure.\n \n(Larry MacDougal/The Canadian Press)\nBrauer said wearing a mask, relying on air filtration systems and taking refuge in clean air shelters can all help limit exposure.\nPeople vulnerable to smoke should prepare for each season by ensuring their medical issues are well managed before the smoke arrives, he said.\nBrauer cautions that governments can no longer approach air pollution caused by wildfire as isolated events, but must be prepared to protect public health every year.\n\"There may come a time where we need to change the way we think of summer,\" he said.\u00a0 \n\"If this is really happening every year, we need to get serious about it.\"\nSmoke particles can change DNA, cause cancer, says B.C. scientist of wildfire health risk\nAfter Earth's hottest week on record, extreme weather surprises everyone \u2014 even climate scientists"},

It ended up being a pretty simple recipe; locally-sourced red chili peppers are quickly seared in a wok before being blended together with a little bit of salt, sugar and vinegar.\nIts simplicity meant testing only took about a week, Albert said.\u00a0\n\"It lasts longer, that tingling taste from the chili,\" he said, blending together a fresh batch of sauce.\n\"A fresher spice, I would say.\"\nAlbert said the sauces became a big hit with customers; many even ask for their own bottle.\nBut despite a positive reaction from customers, Albert isn't sure how long the momentum for the housemade hot sauce will last.\n\"Making our own sauces is not as sustainable,\" he said, noting how Padmanadi plans to open its third location in Calgary this September.\u00a0\n\"Making three restaurants worth of chili sauce, I don't think it's sustainable, but we will see how it goes.\"\nSriracha chili sauce is produced at the Huy Fong Foods factory in California.\n \n(Nick Ut/The Associated Press)\nThe shortage has also made life difficult for Siu To, who owns the Green Onion Cake Man in Edmonton.\nHe said Huy Fong is usually reliable and has never heard about a shortage in the 50 years he's worked in the restaurant business.\n\"This is the only time in my career facing that I have to step in to make our own sauce,\" he said.\nEllen Goddard, an agricultural economist from the University of Alberta, said this Sriracha shortage is indicative of a larger and more serious issue \u2014 a \"symptom of climate change\" \u2014 and one she predicts will\u00a0linger over the next decade.\n\"It's all about water,\" she said.\n\"In some places, there's too much, but in other places, we're not getting enough water, and that's making it very difficult to do agricultural production.\"\nGoddard said the ongoing droughts in food production hotspots mean shortages aren't going away any time soon. But she said manufacturers should look at ways to mitigate the impact, such as planting their crops in other continents like Asia that have similar climates.\n\"Shortages of supply may encourage people to start thinking about different things to grow,\" she said, adding the researchers will eventually come up with drought-resistant crops.\n\"If there's an economic demand for a particular product, like the peppers that go into Sriracha, I'm sure scientists will look at that.\""},

He also served eight\u00a0years as president of the Gwich'in Tribal Council and served as\u00a0chair of the Aboriginal Pipeline Group, a partner in a now-defunct\u00a0natural gas pipeline proposal.\n\"I'm happy that over the years I was able to give back some\u00a0support and encouragement to others,\" he said. \"Through my\u00a0aviation companies, I've supported other northerners to follow\u00a0careers in the aviation industry and trained pilots, flight attendants, dispatchers, radio operators, engineers and mechanics.\"\nCarmichael's work has been recognized through many awards and\u00a0accolades. He is a member of the Order of Canada, has been inducted\u00a0into the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame and the Order of the\u00a0Northwest Territories, and was awarded an honorary doctorate from\u00a0the University of Saskatchewan.\nInuvik pilot Fred Carmichael named to Aviation Hall of Fame\nSurvivor's memories of plane trip to N.W.T. residential school points to aviation's role in the system\nAlong with featuring highlights from Carmichael's career,\u00a0\"Freddie the Flyer\" includes the Gwich'in and Inuvialuktun words\u00a0for the months of the year and their pronunciations.

It runs July 16-23 in and near Kjipuktuk (Halifax), Dartmouth, Millbrook First Nation and Sipekne'katik, Nova Scotia traditional Mi'kma'ki territory.

NAIG is all about friendly\u00a0rivalries, meeting new competitors, learning\u00a0new strategies and\u00a0new languages.\nLike the Olympics, NAIG is multi-disciplinary, with competition in 16 sports, including the three traditional events-\u00a0canoe/kayak, archery and lacrosse. And like the Olympics, the host communities are always proud to share their culture. NAIG athletes and their families and chaperones are immersed in a scene rich with Indigenous food, art, music, dance, fashion.

It is also one of the success stories from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 Calls to\u00a0Action.\u00a0NAIG is living\u00a0proof that sport is a pathway to reconciliation.\nSmithson has watched it happen.\n\"My players from teams I coached still have friends made years and years earlier at NAIG,\" he said. \"And when you travel later in life, the friends you can see in those far away places? It's great. Huge connections and bonds formed.\"\nNAIG is also a logistical challenge. Just getting a chance to compete is no sure thing.\u00a0In southern and eastern Ontario, qualifiers were often held in prohibitively distant towns and many athletes\u00a0weren't able to make\u00a0the16-hour round-trip to the nearest tryouts.\nBasketball coach Gerry Benoit understands the dissatisfaction, but he says it was caused by a deliberate plan to give more northerly communities a better shot at competing.\u00a0In a limited resources endeavour, that's a hard call.\nBenoit, who is coaching a U14 boys NAIG team, shares a quick memory about his own experience at that age.\u00a0When he and his brother were kids in eastern Ontario, they were the only indigenous students in their high school. While other players relaxed in the \"off season\",\u00a0Benoit renamed it \"the improvement season\" and worked hard at his basketball game.\nHe said came back one September to some racist taunts and stupidity. Benoit went one-on-one against his main bully, who learned the hard way that Benoit had developed a left-handed dunk over the summer.\nInspirational stories like that are everywhere at NAIG. Today's competitors will carry the memories and lessons to the younger ones coming up.\nLacrosse keeps getting bigger\nTania Cameron, from\u00a0Kenora, Treaty 3 territory, is building and sharing\u00a0sports knowledge\u00a0at scale. The basketball manager of six teams is heading to NAIG along with sons\u00a0Daniel, an apprentice basketball coach for the U19 males, and Josh, a team chaperone. Both competed at NAIG in the past, as did their sister.\nProud as she is of her own family, Cameron can also boast that at least 21 athletes from her teams have also qualified for other sports at NAIG.\u00a0\nLacrosse is always an important part of NAIG. Kevin Sandy was former CEO of the Halifax 2020 NAIG\u00a0host society, and he's a current director of Haudenosaunee Lacrosse.\u00a0Even though he won't be coaching this time around, Sandy is rubbing his hands in anticipation of the tournament that's about to unfold.\u00a0\nSandy said teams to watch include The Six Nations, British Columbia,\u00a0New York's Haudenosaunee, and the\u00a0Eastern Doors.\nThe main thing is that after six years of practice, Sandy said, the teams are beyond ready and the anticipation levels are off the hook."},

During virtual hearings over eight days, there were 14 witnesses. Jurors also watched video footage of what happened to Oruitemeka when he collapsed at the police station.\nThey determined Oruitemeka died at the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre from an anoxic ischemic brain injury due to cardiovascular collapse, caused by cocaine ingestion.\nHis family described him as \"a devoted son, caring brother and loving uncle,\" according to \na statement from his brother\n, David Oruitemeka. They were seeking a homicide ruling, which would have meant\u00a0it was deliberate action\u00a0by police that led to his death. Demar Hewitt, counsel to the Black Action Defence Committee, also supported\u00a0a homicide verdict.\nMeanwhile, the Thunder Bay Police Service (TBPS), Thunder Bay Police Service Board\u00a0(TBPSB) and seven individual officers\u00a0sought an accidental death\u00a0verdict.\nRick Frank, the lawyer representing Oruitemeka's family, was unable to do an interview with CBC News following the verdict, but provided a statement by email.\n\"The verdict of 'undetermined' reflects the jury's inability to find that Emmanuel's death was an accident. It was a smart decision because it supports what the family has always maintained: the police conduct may very well have contributed to Emmanuel's death,\" he wrote. \"An accidental death is one that is unforeseeable or unexpected. The evidence did not support this verdict and the jury made a well-informed decision.\"\nHe said Oruitemeka's family is grateful for the jury's verdict and recommendations.\u00a0 \n\"The process was difficult, but they learned a lot about Emmanuel's last few days alive, how poorly he was treated by the police officers, and things that should have been done to prevent his death,\" Frank wrote.\nInternal reluctance to acknowledge problems\nCoroners' inquests are intended to prevent future, similar deaths, which is where jury recommendations come into play.\nOf the 14 recommendations, 13 are directed at the TBPS, with an emphasis on addressing systemic racism within the service, including identifying implicit bias, the internal reluctance to acknowledge systemic racism, and understanding the meaning and connotation of certain words and actions in relation to Black people.\nEvidence of \nsystemic racism within the police service\n dates back to the Office of the Independent Police Review Director's 2018 Broken Trust report. Since then, hundreds of recommendations have been directed at the police service and its oversight board.\nIn April, a nine-member expert panel \nissued a 200-page report\n in response to low officer morale, human rights violations, and investigations into criminal misconduct by police officers and leaders.\nAlok Mukherjee, chair of the expert panel that produced a 200-page report urging major changes for policing in Thunder Bay released in April, is shown in a file photo.\n \n(Marc Doucette/CBC)\n\"We've heard from [retired Sgt. Greg Stein]\n \nthat there is in fact internal reluctance to address systemic racism in the Thunder Bay Police Service \u2026 he didn't want to address it himself,\" Frank\u00a0said during the inquest's closing submissions.\nHe also said officers used outdated and offensive language to describe Black people during the inquest.\n\"We want cops to be open, engaged, and having these tough discussions about race and race relations,\" Frank said.\nThe recommendations also include:\nTraining on the roles and responsibilities of other first responders.\nTraining on how to recognize medical distress\u00a0and ascertain medical information from people in custody.\nTraining to improve communications between police members.\u00a0\nMandatory emergency first responder first-aid training for jailers and watch commanders.\nRegular educational and mental health debriefs after incidents that involve the Special Investigations Unit (SIU).\u00a0\nThe final recommendation was for the Ontario government\u00a0to provide funding so\u00a0the TBPS\u00a0can\u00a0deliver an e-learning program to facilitate training that may happen outside of the service's annual block training.\nThose who receive recommendations are asked to provide responses to the Office of the Chief Coroner six months later on whether they've taken steps to implement them\u00a0and, if they haven't,\u00a0why.\nIn an email, Frank said that to give the recommendations weight, their must be an internal willingness to adopt them, \"and to acknowledge that the status quo is not good enough.\"\n\"Too often, there is pushback or unwillingness to change. For example, along with the Black Action Defence Committee, we recommended that Thunder Bay Police Service officers receive training on addressing internal reluctance to address systemic racism. Neither the Service nor the Board joined us in this recommendation. This was surprising, given the evidence of a recently retired sergeant acknowledging this internal reluctance,\" he wrote.\u00a0\n'His death was not foreseeable'\nKevin Matthews, the lawyer who represented seven\u00a0members of the TBPS, spoke of the investigation\u00a0into Oruitemeka's death that had already been completed and found no criminal wrongdoing from\u00a0police\u00a0actions.\n\"You heard testimony about an event that occurred, unfortunately, 9\u00bd\u00a0years ago. That impacts memories and recollection. But consistently between then and now is that no misconduct was found on the part of the officers at any level,\" Matthews said. \"[His] death was not foreseeable.\n\"Special Investigations Unit, an arm's-length police oversight body and independent review, conducted a timely and thorough investigation, and officers were cleared of any potential criminal liability.\"\nFamily seeks homicide verdict from inquest into 2014 death of man in Thunder Bay police custody\nIn Depth\nMore than 6 years later, Moses Beaver's means of death 'undetermined', inquest jury finds\nWhile representatives of parties with standing largely focused their closing submissions on Oruitemeka's means of death, inquest counsel Julian Roy reminded the jury their role was not to pin blame or seek apologies.\nRoy told the jury before they began deliberating, \"What we do want to see is individuals and\u00a0organizations who are involved in a tragedy like this engaging in some serious introspection, some real reflection, doing that difficult work on what can be learned and how things can be done better\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and I fear that we have not yet seen that from your police service.\"\nHe spoke of Oruitemeka's humanity, of what he may have felt in the moments spent at the police station, while being dragged out of the cruiser and into the booking room, then dragged back outside before being carried out by paramedics, as jurors heard during witness testimony.\nCBC Investigates\nIndigenous people detail violent encounters with Thunder Bay police in human rights complaints\nReport on troubled Thunder Bay police board brings hope but also doubt amid warning change will take time\n\"Did he know that he was going to die?\" said Roy. \"And at the end, did he return to his mother and find comfort there? These are questions that, of course, are imponderable, but asking them brings home to us something that must be at the centre of the work that you will be doing on behalf of your community.\n\"That is the value, the worthiness, the sacredness of human life.\""},

In Ontario, the law requires cyclists to wait\u00a0for the conventional traffic lights, but at least\n one province changed that rule in 2019\n after a spate of cyclists deaths in motor vehicle collisions.\nVideo captures cyclist struck, dragged into intersection in north Toronto\nNow, following in line with\u00a0\nQuebec\n, some cyclists are calling for a similar change in Ontario after 36 collisions involving\u00a0cyclists last year in Toronto, with the majority resulting in major injuries and three\u00a0in deaths.\u00a0\nDespite knowing this province's rules, Toronto cycling advocate Alison Stewart says she regularly crosses early with the pedestrian signals.\n\"It's much safer.

No appointments are needed in advance.\nIn Sioux Lookout, the clinic, which opened in early June,\u00a0operates\u00a0at both the Sioux Lookout Meno Ya Win Health Centre's (SLMHC) Mental Health and Addiction Program\u00a0and at the Sioux Lookout Emergency Shelter.\n\"I think that logistically it makes sense because individuals accessing the emergency shelter often feel that they face a lot of stigma accessing care through the hospital or perhaps don't feel comfortable going there,\" said Dr. Justin Bell, SLMHC's chief of mental health and addictions.\n\"We wanted to make sure that some of the people that needed the service the most were getting the service delivered to them where they were staying,\" he said.\nWhile RAAM clinics originated in southern Ontario, more have been opening across northwestern Ontario, including in Thunder Bay, Kenora, Dryden and Fort Frances, said Bell.\n\"We were kind of grabbing on to the momentum of the other communities doing this.\"\u00a0\nFilling service gaps\nSioux Lookout,\u00a0roughly 400 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay, has a history of addiction services that have come and gone due to staffing shortages, COVID-19 and other challenges. There was previously a place that functioned similarly to a RAAM clinic, but it closed just before the pandemic, said Bell. It's hoped the RAAM clinic will\u00a0fill that gap.\nAs a hub for 30 remote First Nations, \nthousands of people travel to Sioux Lookout\n\u00a0for medical care and social services.\n\"[They] often have restricted access to medical resources [where they live] because of the remoteness of the area, and so it's really important that a clinic like this exists so that it can act as a safety net for people that want help, but don't really have the immediately accessible resources otherwise to get help with addiction,\" Bell said.\u00a0\nA naloxone kit comes with two doses of Narcan, gloves, a breathing barrier, and instructions on how to administer the doses to a person who has overdosed. RAAM clinics have naloxone on site as well as other harm reduction supplies.\n \n(Marc Doucette/CBC)\nThe RAAM clinic runs on a team-based model, with a physician, two registered nurses and two other workers who may serve as counsellors or case managers. In the future, Bell would like to bring in elders and traditional healers as part of a regular program.\nIn smaller communities that lack the resources urban centres have, overnight shelters have increasingly become more than just a place to sleep,\u00a0said Henry Wall, chief administrative officer of the Kenora District Services Board, which oversees the shelter.\nWhile larger, long-term treatment centres take years to develop, RAAM clinics offer \"an immediate response to the immediate crisis that we have in our communities,\" Wall said.\nVideo\nShe survived addiction and human trafficking. Now she\u2019s on the front lines helping others\nIn Depth\nWhy many Thunder Bay, Ont., residents travel to B.C. for addiction and trauma treatment\nWhen looking at the need for more wraparound supports, it is important to consider circumstances that contribute to social challenges, including\u00a0the continuing impact of the residential school system, said Wall.\nHaving individualized services that are accessible are a way to help address these harms.\n\"It's important to have a place where \u2026 these programs come together versus sending individuals all over a community in order to access these programs \u2014\u00a0so it's a way of bringing the supports to the person versus sending the person to the support,\" Wall said.\nSafe\u00a0sobering program in development\nBy the end of the year, the emergency shelter will also have 37 beds as part of a new\u00a0safe\u00a0sobering program, said Wall. Of the 37 beds:\n16 will be for safe sobering.\nSix will be for detox.\n15 will be for supportive treatment.\n\"[The] shelter is not just about having a safe place for people to be overnight, but also make sure that \u2026 the community is set up where we're also helping people on a healing journey, helping people to [get] sober in a safe manner, helping people with their addiction,\" said Wall.\nMedical patients flock to this northern community, but there aren't enough places to stay\nNorthwestern Health Unit report recommends safe consumption services in 4 Ontario communities\nThe RAAM clinic is currently open Tuesdays and Thursdays\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at the shelter from 8 a.m. until noon, and at the hospital\u00a0from 1 p.m. until 4 p.m. The clinic has seen several dozen people at the shelter already, including some repeat clients.\u00a0\nAn application has been submitted to Ontario Health North to advocate for more funding from the Ministry of Health to expand the clinic to five days a week and add extra staff members, including peer support workers \u2014\u00a0people with lived experience of addiction who can help others navigate the system, said Bell."},

Captain Christine Sinclair, who captains the Portland Thorns, is one of eight NWSL players. The other two are U.S. college players.\n\"It's been the case for however many World Cups now, when you go down the player list and see what club they play for, it's really only been Canada where the bulk of their players aren't playing at home,\" said Matheson. \"Hopefully this is the last World Cup we see that.\"\nChristine Sinclair, Diana Matheson reveal pro Canadian women's soccer league set for kickoff in 2025\n\"That's absolutely our goal,\" she added. \"I think we can provide a place for a good piece of the national team and many other Canadians who are either playing abroad or aren't yet playing pro.\n\"The more exciting thing for me is there's going to be names hopefully on that World Cup roster next time that we don't even know yet and that are coming up through the ranks in Canada and we get to know first through this pro league and then we get to watch them at the next Women's World Cup.\"\nWorld Cups have provided different memories for Matheson.\n2015 quarterfinal loss tough to swallow\nIn 2019, sidelined by injury, she enjoyed a new role as a TV analyst.

Outscored 7-1 by France, Germany and Nigeria, Canada finished 16th and last.\n\"That was heartbreak, but I think in some ways was the catalyst that led to 2012,\" Matheson said, referencing the bronze-medal run at the London Olympics under John Herdman. \"I think it focused us in a lot more on what we needed to do, especially when John came in.\"\nMatheson says the fourth-place finish in 2003 in the U.S., with Norwegian coach Even Pellerud at the helm, holds a special place in her heart. It was her first World Cup and first year on the Canadian team. After dispatching China 1-0 in the quarterfinals, Canada lost 2-1 to Sweden in the semifinal and 3-1 to the U.S. in third-place game.\n\"We came fourth, back in the day with Route 1 soccer, direct soccer. The midfielders mostly played defence and tried to win the ball and then get it to the forwards pretty quickly,\" she said. \"But it worked. And we almost squeaked through to a final.\"\n\"I have such fond memories of that team,\" she added. \"That was a team like London, like Tokyo (where Canada won Olympic gold in 2021) where you had a really core group of fantastic veterans that set the tone -- Charmaine Hooper, Andrea Neil, Silvana Burtini, so many others -- and this really young hungry group of kids coming up with Sinc [Christine Sinclair], myself, Erin McLeod.\"\nMore soccer coverage\nCanada failed to get out of the group stage in 2007 in China under Pellerud, conceding a 92nd-minute goal in a 2-2 tie with Australia that prevented the Canadians from moving on. Sinclair had scored in the 85th minute to give Canada the lead.\nMatheson recently earned her MBA from the Smith School of Business at Queen's University. She has also finished UEFA's Executive Master for International Players (MIP), a 20-month program designed to equip top international players with the tools required to transfer their playing strengths into effective management skills off the pitch.\nThe franchise fee for the proposed new women's league is $1 million with a need for an estimated $8 million to $10 million in total invested capital over the first five seasons in addition to necessary spending on infrastructure. Owners are buying a piece of the league as well as their own franchise.\nProject 8 Sports Inc. was founded by Matheson and Thomas Gilbert.\nMatheson's distinguished playing career included the stoppage-time goal that earned Canada a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics. She won 206 caps for Canada (including 193 starts) from 2003 to 2020."},

Sports are my life.'\"\nHe is among hundreds of Mi'kmaw athletes, along with about 5,000 other Indigenous teenagers from around North America, competing in the Games. Opening ceremonies will be held Sunday and the Games go\u00a0until July 23 in Kjipuktuk (Halifax), Dartmouth, N.S., and Millbrook First Nation in central Nova Scotia.\nFollowing his injury, doctors told Prosper not to play any contact sports, such as basketball. The news crushed Prosper, who had hoped to compete in NAIG.\u00a0\n\"I cried because all I wanted to do was play sports and make it somewhere,\"\u00a0he said. \"I became depressed.\"\nSports with cultural significance\nWeeks of uncertainty went by until he was contacted by Team Mi'kmaw Nova Scotia canoe/kayak head coach Robin Thomson, who gave Prosper the chance at another shot, suggesting he take up competitive paddling.\n\"Once I heard his story, I encouraged him to come paddle,\"\u00a0Thomson said. \"It's incredible to come from an injury and go through a tough period and find another path.\"\nProsper was hesitant at first as he sat inside the boat, elevating his leg to ease any pressure. But he felt \"at peace\" and thought of his late grandfather, who paddled for decades.\u00a0\n\"I was canoeing one night by myself and about five feet away from me an eagle landed right in front of me and we locked eyes,\" Prosper said. \"I couldn't believe it. To us that's medicine.\"\nPaddling has a deep cultural significance for the Mi'kmaq, as do\u00a0archery and lacrosse, which are also among the 15 sports at NAIG.\u00a0Team Mi'kmaw Nova Scotia, also known as Mlkukte'n Klu'lkw Tla'teken, has athletes competing in all sports at the Games, which are open to athletes 13 to 19 years of age.\nAyden Pierro, the head coach for the Team Mi'kmaw Nova Scotia U16 lacrosse team, has been gearing up for the long-awaited return of the Games, which were cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19.\nHe incorporates the sport's philosophical aspects, which focus on respect for fellow players as a reminder that the game serves a greater purpose.\n\"You respect the coaches, the players and of course the game and the Creator,\"\u00a0he said. \"I think they're ready, but I don't think they are ready for the experience. How can you be ready for an experience like this?\"\nIn this artwork by Gerald Gloade, the northern lights are seen behind the spirit of an Indigenous ancestor who plays lacrosse in Wasoq, Mi'kmaw heaven.\n \n(Gerald Gloade)\nLacrosse, with its origins in the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, is known as the \"medicine game.\"\u00a0It spread to many other nations, making it a highlight of the Games, and has been played for generations.\nPierro is the wellness support co-ordinator for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Mental Wellness Team and visits communities to tell the history of the game. He recounts the legend of Glooscap and the Wizard Winpe, a story that traces how lacrosse was brought to Mi'kmaw territory.\n\"It's about two strong beings engaging in a contest to see who is more powerful. Both agreed to three games, with each winning the first two. The final game was lacrosse and Glooscap won and demanded the medicinal game for the people.\"\nThe team had\u00a0been preparing for the Games before the pandemic, and the\u00a0delays\u00a0gave the coaches and the Indigenous Players Lacrosse Association more time to restructure\u00a0the team.\n\"When you go into your first NAIG, you really don't know what you're getting yourself into,\"\u00a0Pierro said, reflecting on his 2014 and 2017 Games. \"When I went, it became one of the best years of my life and brought me where I am today.\"\u00a0\nHead coach Robin Thomson suggested Prosper take up competitive paddling after his injury.\n \n(Submitted by Robin Thomson)\nCole Prosper's father, Phillip Prosper, believes his son's injury shifted\u00a0his path\u00a0toward a greater purpose.\u00a0\n\"It's almost like fate,\"\u00a0Phillip Prosper said. \"It's as if my father's spirit is guiding him in that direction. My father was very good at canoeing and was competitive. I think canoeing was Cole's calling.\"\nCole Prosper said the eagle that landed on his canoe reminds him to incorporate \nthe Seven Sacred Teachings\n during team practices.\n\"I'm always reminded to stay calm and be humble before getting on the water,\" he said. \"Once I'm at the Games, I won't be the one paddling, it'll be my grandfather paddling the boat with me.\""},

For some producers, any precipitation may be too late.\nThe Special Areas Board, which covers more than five million acres in east-central Alberta, also declared \nan agricultural disaster\n,\u00a0for Special Area No. 2, 3, and 4 on July 12, the second time it had done so in more than 20 years.\n\"Dry conditions are not new to the Special Areas, but ongoing moisture deficiencies and hot temperatures have devastated crops and pasture throughout the region,\" wrote Jordon Christianson, chair of the board, in a statement.\u00a0\n\"Producers are struggling to find enough grass, water\u00a0and feed for their cattle. Farmers are facing widespread crop failures. Significant grasshopper infestations are making a very difficult situation worse in many parts of the Special Areas.\"\n \n(CBC)\nEd Vandenberg, who farms potatoes, dry beans and corn\u00a0near Enchant, Alta., says he's fortunate to have irrigation, because without it, he wouldn't have a crop this year\u00a0\u2014 but it has led to challenges for his neighbours.\n\"It just puts a bit of a negative gloom over the area, when neighbours get together and they're talking about the crops and the state of the crops,\" Vandenberg said.\n\"It's discouraging when you have good crops, and the potential and the promise of a good harvest, that brings a smile to farmers' faces. But they're far and few between right now.\"\u00a0\nAgriculture\u00a0is a key part of Alberta's economy, contributing $8.1 billion in GDP in 2021 and employing more than 58,300 Albertans, according to\u00a0\nInvest Alberta\n.\u00a0\nLivestock producers also facing trouble\nBrodie Haugan, chair of Alberta Beef Producers, said though the drought areas may be getting smaller, where it is affecting producers it is severe.\u00a0\nExtreme drought and weather in the past has led\u00a0\nbeef producers\n\u00a0in Canada and in the United States\u00a0\nto thin herds in near-record numbers\n. That's taking place again this year, Haugan said.\n\"A lot of operations that were forced to take measures in past years haven't been able to build their numbers back this year,\" Haugan said.\u00a0\nHigh beef prices a bright spot for Alberta producers coping with prolonged drought\nMunicipal agricultural disasters don't automatically trigger funding or program responses. They are\u00a0used to signal that the conditions that farmers are facing are growing dire to provincial and federal governments.\nBut McLauchlin, the RMA president, said they are an important exercise, and aren't taken lightly.\nConditions in the Special Areas, which cover more than five million acres in east-central Alberta, are shown in these two photos. The Special Areas Board says ongoing moisture deficiencies and hot temperatures have devastated crops and pasture throughout the region.\n \n(Submitted by Special Areas Board)\nMoving forward, he said conversations were starting to take shape around what the future of agriculture in the province might look like.\n\"South Africa had a\u00a0[dire] drought. And they responded to it by actually using the landscape to mitigate and create a more certain future, whether it was a better use of water, water recycling, check dams\u00a0and a lot of other conversations\u00a0\u2014 even around crop choices,\" he said.\n\"So I think those discussions have happened lately. But I think that\u00a0\u2026 at the end of this year, we need to start having those bigger conversations with multiple folks at the table, and decide how we're going to take this on in the future.\"\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Alberta Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation RJ Sigurdson\u00a0said it was working with the \nAgriculture Financial Services Corporation\n to support producers who are considering putting their crops to alternate uses, rather than waiting until maturity to harvest.\n\"We have heard the concerns of crop and livestock producers, and continue to closely monitor the situation and explore possible support options,\" spokesperson Callum Reid wrote in a statement."},

It looks after primary care. It's looking after continuing care. It's also a service provider. It's also developing policy. All of these areas were beyond the scope it was originally intended for.\"\nPremier Danielle Smith released a hefty \nfour-page health mandate letter\n\u00a0on Tuesday, six weeks after LaGrange was sworn in as minister.\nAfter four years as education minister, LaGrange is now charged with addressing health care recruitment and retention challenges across Alberta, including rural access to obstetricians, midwives and family doctors.\nThe premier also asked LaGrange to be willing\u00a0to \"reform the management and structure of Alberta Health Services (AHS) to better decentralize decision-making and resources to the front lines and local communities.\"\nSmith's letter says the health system must welcome innovation and incentivize the best patient care.\nIn 2008, the Progressive Conservative government of the day created AHS\u00a0by merging all regional health authorities and a handful of provincial health agencies.\nIt was the first provincewide health authority in Canada. More than 125,000 employees now work for AHS or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nSince pursuing the United Conservative Party leadership last year, Smith has said she wants to reform AHS to allow local leaders to act more quickly to start new programs or respond to local problems.\nOn Tuesday, LaGrange said she doesn't want to presuppose the outcome of this reorganization, nor did she give a timeline for when the government would make restructuring decisions.\u00a0\nLaGrange ruled out the idea of hiring a consultant to conduct another analysis of the organization.\nIn 2020, the UCP government released the results of a $2-million AHS review performed by Ernst &Young, which recommended measures it said could save nearly $2 billion per year.\nAHS review finds ways to save up to $1.9B \u2014 next up is deciding which measures to implement\nLaGrange said the time for studies is done, and the government will instead act on previous recommendations. However, closing or consolidating rural hospitals, as the EY review recommended, is not on her to-do list, LaGrange said.\nHealth-care union leaders, meanwhile, have raised concerns about restructuring a system that is already under strain from high patient demand, growing government expectations and a shortage of workers.\nHealth-care unions skeptical about some proposed health system fixes\nStaff shortages keep operating rooms at High Prairie hospital closed for years\nAlberta nurses' escalating overtime is pushing some of their pay sky high\n\"Our\u00a0health-care workers need stability and investment in the work they do every single day,\" Health Sciences Association of Alberta president Mike Parker said on Tuesday. \"Not conflict between a public health guarantee and alternative models. Not this unknown nebulous of decentralization.\"\nHSAA president Mike Parker has concerns about restructuring a system that is already under strain from high patient demand.\n \n(HSAA website)\nAlthough the UCP government has been outsourcing some functions of the health system to private companies, Smith has said no Albertan will have to pay out of pocket for insured health services, such as a family doctor visit.\nPremier Danielle Smith fires Alberta Health Services board, appoints administrator\nNDP primary and rural health critic David Shepherd said the government's pledge of decentralizing decision making is ironic, given Smith fired the AHS board and installed an administrator to speed up change.\n\"It's a bit laughable that she's suddenly now saying she wants to be more regional, collaborative and empower local healthcare workers and others,\" Shepherd said. \"I don't think our system would be helped by creating additional red tape, additional boards.\"\nWhen asked, LaGrange didn't say whether splitting AHS back into regional boards was a possibility.\nMinister to fix 'unacceptable' lab delays\nSmith has also asked LaGrange to resolve \"the unacceptable lab services delay challenge\" as patients, particularly in Calgary and southern Alberta, are sometimes left waiting more than a month for routine tests.\nDuring the last year, AHS has outsourced more lab testing to Dynalife, a company that was already running community labs in Edmonton and parts of northern Alberta. Privatizing more of the service was one of the EY report's recommendations that was supposed to save money.\nLab waits in Medicine Hat drive patients to emergency room for tests\nLong waits for blood work leave Calgarians on edge after community labs privatized\nHowever, patients who depended on routine or timely tests sometimes spent hours waiting in emergency rooms instead to get their tests done on time.\nLaGrange wouldn't say what solutions the government is considering, but that officials have made it clear to Dynalife they expect the company to scale up its staffing and improve service.\n\"Albertans deserve the best lab services available,\" she said.\u00a0\"And right now that's not happening.\"\nShe did not say what the consequences would be for Dynalife, should they continue to fail to meet expectations.\nDynalife deferred questions to Alberta Health.\nHSAA represents around 3,000 lab workers across the province in both public and private labs.\nUnion president Parker said the service Dynalife provides has eroded because the company\u00a0now needs to skim off profits for shareholders.\n\"How do you make those profits? It's in cutting of resources, time, scheduling, workers,\" he said.\nParker was happy to see the premier address worker concerns such as employee shortages in the mandate letter, saying unions have been pointing out the problem for years.\nAmong the rest of LaGrange's to-do list is containing to try reducing surgical and emergency room wait times, addressing a taxed EMS system, and strategizing how to recruit and retain workers, especially in rural Alberta.\nShe'll also implement UCP\u00a0election promises to expand disease screening for newborns and bolster women's health research."},

We no longer can live healthy, effective lives without electricity.\"\nThe regulated rate option, or RRO, is the default power price most customers pay if they do not sign a contract with an electricity retailer.\nAccording to the province's \nMarket Surveillance\u00a0Administrator\n, 559,000 customers, or about 35 per cent of the Alberta sites with power, were paying the RRO as of March 2023. A disproportionate number of those people live in the Edmonton area, CEO Derek Olsmtead said in an email.\nAlberta reviewing future of regulated rate option for electricity\nPlan to help Albertans with high electricity prices could leave post-election hangover\nAccording to data on the \nUtilities Consumer Advocate (UCA) website\n, the RRO prices in Alberta in July were as high as 28 cents per kilowatt hour. That's more than double the winter price, when the government temporarily capped the RRO.\nAccording to the advocate, Edmonton customers looking for a fixed-rate power contract right now could pay between 9.7 and 30 cents per kWh.\nAs power prices have climbed, more customers have stepped away from the RRO. Olmstead said the number of RRO sites has dropped by about 22 per cent since 2019.\nLethbridge-East MLA Nathan Neudorf is minister of affordability and utilities. He was paying default electricity prices at his Edmonton condo until he realized why his bills were spiking.\n \n(Nathan Neudorf/Facebook)\nNeudorf was among the clients who made the switch.\u00a0Although he has\u00a0a contract at his Lethbridge home, the bills were climbing at his Edmonton condominium, he said.\nIt wasn't until the price tag hit $250 per\u00a0month, and he\u00a0was sworn in as minister, that Neudorf realized he was on the RRO.\nColette Chekerda is executive director of the Alberta Direct Connect Consumer Association, and president of Carmal Energy Advisors, which provides power advice to large, industrial customers.\nChekerda said\u00a0the government should have looked at retiring the RRO long ago.\nCash-strapped Albertans may be stuck repaying $200M cap on regulated rates, says report\n\"There's certainly better options for consumers out there, and the regulated rate option has probably gotten in the way of some of those offerings being enhanced over the past several years,\" she said.\nChekerda said Alberta's deregulated electricity market, which is supposed to lead to more competition, has driven prices higher than in some provinces where Crown corporations are at the helm.\nChanges to RRO could come by fall\nThe challenge is that some people who have been unemployed or have a poor credit rating can't get power retailers to offer them a contract, Neudorf said.\nHe added that other customers who watch power markets closely hop between contracts and the RRO so they're always paying the lowest price, he said.\nIt means the government will likely have to devise two replacements for the RRO: one\u00a0for consumers who actively want to play the market, and one for more financially precarious customers\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but with fraud guardrails,\u00a0Neudorf said.\nHe didn't rule out the idea of the government being a guarantor for people with poor credit to get power contracts.\nGrande Prairie scrutinizing electricity costs amid concerns about disparities across Alberta\nDid Alberta overbuild its energy infrastructure? This critic thinks so, and it affects what you pay\nChanges could come as soon as this fall, but the timing depends on whether legislation is required.\nEnsuring Alberta has a larger supply of more reliable electricity is also a key factor to driving prices down, Neudorf\u00a0said.\nThe premier's letter also tasks Neudorf with other electrical system reviews and changes\u00a0\u2014 with an eye to affordability and aiming for a carbon-neutral power grid.\nNeudorf is to review the province's pricing system, with the goal of reducing transmission and distribution costs.\nHe said diving into the minutiae of power pricing could be an incredible opportunity for change\u00a0\u2014 it\u00a0includes continuing the province's resistance to the federal government's demand for electrical systems to be net-zero by 2035, and pushback against federal taxes that Neudorf\u00a0said multiply the costs.\nNet-zero electricity grid for Alberta by 2035 is possible, Wilkinson says\nAlthough critics argue climate-change measures cannot wait, Neudorf said a transition away from fossil fuels so quickly in Alberta could lead to unmanageable cost escalation.\n\"You just can't turn the heat off in the middle of winter,\" he said. \"You will literally die. And the concern is the same in the summer.\"\nNDP energy and climate critic Nagwan Al-Guneid said in a statement the government should consider more urgent relief for Albertans, such as a cap on electricity prices, while embracing\u00a0more renewable energy options.\n\"We cannot force people to pay punitive bills while the UCP admires this problem for another four years,\" she said.\nNeudorf is also tasked with working with Seniors, Community and Social Services Minister Jason Nixon to develop a new affordable home ownership and rental strategy that encourages\u00a0new home construction.\nAsked by email if he would consider rent control as a short-term measure, Neudorf said, \"I keep an open mind as to the best ways to achieve this.\""},

A\u00a0panel of five experts recommended a reduction in the level of fluoride to 0.7 mg/L.

It's all across North America,\" said Pearce.\n\"We have huge wait-lists and we have empty operating rooms and operating facilities that we could use that we can't.\"\nRecruitment underway, AHS says\nAlberta Health Services did not answer questions about operating room closures but\u00a0said it is working to recruit anesthesiologists around the province.\u00a0\nAccording to the health authority,\u00a0470 anesthesiologists were working for AHS\u00a0as of July 13, an increase of 20 since the end of March.\nIn a statement,\u00a0AHS said it's recruiting for\u00a065\u00a0positions, including both permanent and locum positions.\n\"Some of these positions have already been filled and others are in the offer stage,\" spokesperson James Wood said in an email, adding 40 of those are new positions.\nAll this comes at a time when Alberta is trying to reduce its surgical backlog and boost\u00a0the number of publicly funded procedures performed through\u00a0\ncontracted private surgical facilities\n.\n\u00a0AHS said it aims to conduct a total of 310,000 surgeries (in hospitals and chartered facilities) this fiscal year compared with 292,500 last year.\nWith the increased use of private facilities,\u00a0Wolstenholme wants to see safeguards in place to protect the hospital system from losing anesthesiologists to these facilities.\n\"There needs to be some measure to make sure that \u2026 the hospital system is still served so that patients, when they come in at their sickest, still have qualified workers to look after them,\" Wolstenholme said.\nAHS said its anesthesiologists and surgeons are sent to private facilities only to do work under publicly funded contracts.\n'We have huge wait-lists and we have empty operating rooms,' says Dr. Craig Pearce, an anesthesiologist at the Peter Lougheed Centre in Calgary.\n \n(Craig Pearce)\nCanada-wide shortage\nThe Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society has been trying to raise the alarm about the shortage for years.\n\"I am very\u00a0concerned about the shortage of anesthesiologists in the country. Despite a near doubling of physician anesthesia providers in the past 20 years, today's demand outstrips our current supply,\"\u00a0Dr.\u00a0Lucie Filteau,\u00a0 the group's president, said in an email.\n\"Operating room closures (and postponement of surgeries) are happening on a daily basis across the country due to human resource constraints.\"\u00a0 \nRed Deer hospital struggling through shortage of anesthesiologists\nAlberta Health redirects thousands of orthopedic surgeries to independent clinics to tackle backlog\nFilteau said\u00a0shortages of other operating room staff\u00a0and a lack of\u00a0hospital beds also contribute to the problem.\nOne key step, according to the group, is the use of anesthesia care teams (ACTs), which have been implemented,\u00a0to varying degrees, around the country.\nAnesthesia care teams\nIn Alberta, ACTs\u00a0allow one anesthesiologist to oversee more than one operating room\u00a0at a time, with the support\u00a0of respiratory therapists for some minor procedures.\nA\u00a0\npilot project\n\u00a0was launched by AHS\u00a0last year\u00a0using\u00a0this system\u00a0for cataract surgeries.\n\"AHS is expanding the anesthesia care team (ACT) model in cases where this model has been shown to be safe, effective and efficient,\" said Wood, adding the model is now being used for podiatry surgeries in the Calgary zone.\n190 Calgary doctors warn emergency rooms 'collapsing' in open letter\nPearce cautions that expanding the use of ACTs\u00a0must be done with safety in mind.\n\"The fact that we are now slowly being diverted and replaced along the way is just further evidence of how severe the situation is,\" he said.\nAccording to\u00a0Pearce, there are also efforts to increase anesthesia training spots and to use more family physicians who are specially trained in anesthesia."},

A member of the public complained to the college, alleging that between March and August she instigated a sexual relationship with the individual.\nIn April of that year, a month after his discharge, the documents say the nurse sent her former patient a Facebook message.\nThe tribunal says the ensuing communication included sexually explicit messages and photos of Magnusson.\u00a0\nIn June, the report says, they shared a hotel room in Edmonton and had intercourse on \"multiple occasions.\"\nIt also alleges she injected her former patient with an \"unknown agent\" in preparation for a tattoo appointment that summer.\u00a0\nMagnusson admitted to the allegations during her hearing, the report says.\nThey were in contact until August of that year, and Magnusson left a voice message for him on the anniversary of his sobriety in December.\nTribunal finds violations of conduct and ethics rules\nProfessional standards for nurses forbid them from having sexual relationships with patients for a minimum of one year after they last provided medical care for them.\u00a0\n\"The hearing tribunal received evidence in which Ms. Magnusson herself stated, 'Pretty sure I should not be reaching out for 1 year to you etc.,'\" the decision said.\nViolating that timeline is considered sexual abuse by the college. A victim impact statement provided to the tribunal also stated the personal and mental impact the individual felt after the interactions with Magnusson.\nThe tribunal found her conduct breached rules on patient-nurse relationships, prohibited sexual conduct, sexual relations with former patients and providing nursing services to partners. Magnusson broke at least six different codes of conduct, ethics rules and standards of practice for nurses.\u00a0\nThe college told CBC News it does not comment on decisions. The college\u00a0is responsible for \"protecting the public from unethical, unskilled\u00a0and unsure nursing practice of LPNs under the authority of the Alberta Health Professions Act.\"\u00a0\nOne doctor says people undergoing addictions treatment can be especially vulnerable.\u00a0\n\"Because of the stigma, it takes a lot of effort and time for them to open up towards health practitioners,\" said Monty Ghosh, an addictions treatment specialist and assistant professor at the University of Calgary and University of Alberta.\u00a0\n\"We have to really be cautious of how we approach our clients and being aware they might have faced trauma in the past and that whatever we do with the clients could reignite that. And that includes blurring the boundaries between relationships and intimacy.\"\u00a0\nThe tribunal agreed to a joint submission suggesting penalties for Magnusson. Her nursing permit was cancelled and she was ordered to pay 25 per cent of the costs of the investigation and hearing.\nThe College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta received 148 professional misconduct complaints in 2022. Of those, four centred around sexual abuse or misconduct toward a patient. Magnusson's was the only case of the four that resulted in a licence being cancelled."},

We feel it should be here in Halifax, as silly as it sounds.\"\nNicholas Nahas is co-owner of King of Donair with his two brothers, Norman and Andrew Nahas.\n \n(Submitted by Nicholas Nahas)\nThe donair \u2014 which consists of roasted shaved beef, tomatoes and onions wrapped in a pita and drizzled with a sweet sauce \u2014 was declared Halifax's official food in 2015.\nIt was created in the port city in the 1970s by Greek restaurateur Peter Gamoulakos, who wanted to share the flavours of his homeland with Halifax. The taste of the traditional\u00a0Greek gyro was not well received, and so he made some adjustments.\nThe donair eventually made its way out West, as droves of Maritimers fled to Alberta in search of better wages, and their favourite late-night fare.\nBut the western Canadian eateries don't always get it right, according to Josh Robinson, who owns the Blowers & Grafton restaurant chain in the Calgary and Edmonton areas.\nIt often looks more like the Greek gyro and includes ingredients like\u00a0pickled turnip and lettuce.\nBlowers & Grafton serves up authentic East Coast fare, and even ships its donair meat to Alberta from Nova Scotia.\n \n(Blowers and Grafton)\nRobinson, who is originally from Halifax, sought to change that. Blowers &\u00a0Grafton serves up \"authentic Halifax street food\"\u00a0\u2014 they even have their donair meat shipped from Nova Scotia.\nRobinson said when he saw the costume, he knew he had to have it.\n\"We found it so funny,\" said Robinson.\u00a0\"There's a whole bunch of things we've been discussing and we could have a lot of fun with this thing.\"\nWhy this Smithsonian astronomer has a donair website\nGiven Robinson's connection to the donair's birthplace, he promised the costume would not be staying in Alberta should Blowers &\u00a0Grafton win the\u00a0race.\n\"I think it belongs in Alberta as much as it\u00a0belongs in Nova Scotia,\u00a0and I think it can have\u00a0some travel along the way,\" said Robinson.\n\"The cool thing about the donair\u00a0is that it's become a Canadian staple\u00a0\u2014 it's actually one of the most Canadian things out there. That's part of what my partners are thinking about. There's a lot of fun things we can do with this donair suit across the country.\"\nNahas says an authentic donair contains thinly sliced spiced beef on pita, with tomatoes, onions and sweet sauce. But hold the lettuce.\n \n(Nicholas Nahas)\nNahas said winning the costume\u00a0would be a fitting way to celebrate his\u00a0restaurant chain's\u00a050th anniversary.\n\"Maybe we'll find a place to hang it up and obviously if we get it, we'll have it patrol up and down the road,\" he said.\nBoth Robinson and\u00a0Nahas said they are exploring the possibility of trying to work with the\u00a0Alberta\u00a0government to add\u00a0a charitable aspect to the auction, given it's bound to fetch several thousand\u00a0dollars.\nNeither are willing to say just how far they'll go to snag the suit.\nBut there is one other thing they can both\u00a0agree\u00a0on: lettuce has no place on a donair, or a donair costume.\n\"I know a lot of good barbers in town,\" said Nahas, adding that King of Donair\u00a0now has locations in both Nova Scotia and Alberta. \"We'll get a little haircut and trim that green stuff off if we end up winning.\"\nAuction closes Aug. 14\nHow the Alberta government came into possession of the unusual item is not clear, and requests for comment Thursday were not immediately returned.\nHowever, the\u00a0question was posed by a user on the auction website.\n\"This costume was a prop for an advertising campaign and is no longer required by the department,\" replied Surplus Sales Edmonton.\nThe costume's description said it\u00a0is made of different latexes, vulcanized rubbers and synthetics, and comes equipped with a silver-coloured body suit \"for an authentic tinfoil look!\"\nThe website said the auction is running longer than usual \u2014 a full month \u2014 due to \"the rarity\" of the piece.

But what does that mean?\nThose calculations are based on recent studies that suggest official figures for methane release are significant underestimates. A series of published papers has concluded the methane releases inventoried by the federal government from industry reports are far too low.\nThose concerns are echoed in a report this year from the auditor general's office.\n\"Several Canadian scientific studies suggest that total emissions are under-reported in the national inventory and that the distribution of emissions is likely inaccurate,\" it says.\nChapman said the Dunsky paper multiplies methane emissions in Canada's national inventory by 1.7 to achieve a more likely estimate of what's actually being released into the atmosphere.\n\"We're pretty confident that 1.7 is representative of reality.\"\nOilsands emissions 65% higher than tallied by current measuring methods, study suggests\nCarbon rules key to Irving Oil's new clean-energy deal, says gas partner\nDunsky's cost estimate is close to that of the International Energy Agency. Earlier this year, that body estimated that methane equivalent to about 30,000 tonnes of carbon could be eliminated from the Canadian oilpatch \u2014 roughly what it would take to meet the federal goal \u2014 for $13 a tonne or less.\nAs well, the Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based clean-energy think tank, released a 2021 report concluding Canada could reduce methane emissions by 80 per cent from 2012 levels for less than $25 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent.\nA call for strict standards\nThe Dunsky paper comes as the federal government prepares a new set of regulations for methane, a greenhouse gas up to 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Its conclusions should encourage Ottawa to set strict standards, said Ari Pottens of Environmental Defence.\n\"We're looking for the regulations to be as ambitious as the proposed framework was,\" he said.\nEnvironmental Defence wants the rules to ban venting and flaring of methane from oil and gas sites. It wants regular and frequent inspections to ensure compliance and bans on certain types of equipment prone to leak.\nThe Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Dunsky report.\nHowever, industry has committed to reducing emissions by 45 per cent by 2025. Alberta's 2021 progress report found methane releases from oil and gas fell about 44 per cent between 2014 and 2021, although that figure is based on official emission estimates.\n \nIf we're able to cut back on methane emissions now, we're actually buying ourselves time later to address some of the tougher climate issues.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n- Ari Pottens\nPottens said it makes sense for government and industry to go hard after methane.\nThe effort is cost-effective, he said, and can result in a more saleable product for natural gas producers. But because methane affects climate so strongly at first and then gradually fades, tackling it presents an opportunity.\n\"If we're able to cut back on methane emissions now, we're actually buying ourselves time later to address some of the tougher climate issues.\""},

Melvin was the only sergeant from that battalion missing on that date with no known grave.\nAll the archival documentation, including personnel files, casualty cards, war diaries and other documents, pointed to it being him in the grave, and could not be anyone else, Davis said.\n\"The documentation showed that Sgt. Melvin had been hit by a shell during the battle in the village of Th\u00e9lus and was buried as one of the original graves at the cemetery in the aftermath of the assault,\" she said in an email.\u00a0\n\"We don't know why he wasn't identified at the time, but there was enough historical evidence to identify him now.\"\nEnlisted in Calgary\nMelvin was born on June 3, 1887, in the small Scottish village of\u00a0Udny, in Aberdeenshire,\u00a0to James and Helen Melvin.

As a part of the 31st, he was trained in how to conduct operations from trenches.\nHe was then sent to France, where he was stationed in a trench for roughly 100 days.\nIt rained for around 75 of those days, and the soldiers had to contend with the mud, the rain\u00a0and the vermin\u00a0\u2014 rats\u00a0as well as lice, said Wes Krause, curator of the South Alberta Light Horse\u00a0museum.\u00a0\n\"It was not easy for the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I,\" Krause said, adding that CEF was a highly-trained force that was respected by Allied forces in France.\nThe trenches at Vimy Ridge were muddy, wet and rat-infested during the war, but today they have been reinforced with concrete to be preserved for tourists.\n \n(Lara Chatterjee/CBC)\nDuring the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the 31st Infantry Battalion was assigned a portion of the ridge\u00a0to take possession of. They would move through the trenches, across open field and through barbed wire entanglements, facing the German machine guns, in order to take their objectives, Krause said.\nThe battalion took heavy losses. Of the initial 1,000 or so men who made up the regiment, 941\u00a0died.\nThere were more than 2,300 non-fatal injuries en route to the battalion's ultimate goal, Krause said.\n\"That was to, basically, bring the end of World War I, secure Europe and France, and protect it from the Germans,\" he said.\nCeremony will come in near future\nIn cases such as this, those soldiers who have been discovered will get the funerals they deserve, Griffiths said.\nThat will be the case for Melvin, whose headstone will be rededicated in a ceremony at the earliest opportunity,\u00a0National\u00a0Defence says.\nThere are small teams who complete this sort of work, particularly in Canada, said Davis, the military heritage historian.\n\"It is a team effort, in order to give Sgt. Melvin his name back,\" she said.\nFor Melvin's remaining family, those efforts don't go unnoticed.\u00a0Neilson\u00a0said he and his family would like to attend the ceremony after details are finalized.\n\"I wonder what he would say if he knew what\u00a0all these people had done for him.

The team is working to get a clearer picture of how many twisters are hitting Canada. \n \n(Megan McCleister/CBC)\nAn EF-4 signals wind speeds between\u00a0 270-310 km/h. The EF scale tops out at 5, with even high wind speeds and \"massive devastation,\" according to \nPublic Safety Canada\n.\nCanada's deadliest tornado tore through Regina in 1912. The EF-4 killed 28 people and left 2,500 homeless. If such extreme weather proves increasingly common in Central Canada, it poses an even greater risk, say experts, with some 18 million people living between Windsor and Quebec City.\nAaron Jaffe, an\u00a0NTP researcher who led the team on the ground in Tweed, warned against minimizing twisters classified only as EF-0 or EF-1.\n\"All it takes is a tree to fall into the house or cottage, and then you have significant damage,\" he said.\nBuilding resiliency\nPart of the work by the NTP seeks to build Canada's resiliency to tornadoes.\n\"If we know where they're happening with greater precision, we can come up with adaptation strategies that make a lot more sense,\"\u00a0said Greg Kopp, an\u00a0engineering professor at Western University.\nAn image of the EF-4-rated tornado damage at the farm on the west side of Highway 2A between Didsbury and Carstairs, Alta., on July 1. A woman took shelter in the home's basement and survived. \n \n(Northern Tornadoes Project)\nKopp said Canadian building codes need to be updated to reflect the growing risk posed by tornadoes,\u00a0and homebuilders should consider small investments to lessen the potential impact of a twister.\n\"Twenty years ago when we started talking about this, the only reaction we ever got was, 'You're crazy,'\" said Kopp, who acts as NTP's lead researcher.\nHe said simple additions to new builds, such as hurricane straps or roof clips, could help prevent major damage and only cost a few hundred dollars. The\u00a0small connectors\u00a0can keep roofs attached, even in the event of an EF-2 tornado, Kopp\u00a0added."},

It'll always be there, until someone says something.\"\u00a0\nLalonde said\u00a0all the family needs is to hear from someone who was there the night he died, so the family can find \"some kind of answer.\"\nRumors of 'hotshots'\u00a0in the community\nOn the night her son died, Michelle\u00a0went to visit him at his friend's house in Sudbury. They had made plans to meet up early the next day to run some errands.\nAround 2 a.m., she received a good-night text\u00a0\u2014 the last time she heard from him.\u00a0\nPolice reached out to her late in the afternoon the following day to inform her Justin's body had been found in the basement of his friend's house.\nAn autopsy later revealed there was two and a half times the lethal dose\u00a0of carfentanil in Justin's system.\nBarriault loved to be outdoors and spent a lot of time fishing in the deep waters of Temagami Lake.\n \n(Submitted by Michelle Barriault)\nPeople who were at the house told police they tried to revive him using CPR and the opioid rescue medication naloxone, but the coroner told the family there were no traces of that life-saving medicine in\u00a0his\u00a0system.\nMichelle believes her son was a victim of a \"hotshot.\"\nThat term encompasses many things, said\u00a0Evie Ali, executive director of Go Give Project, a Sudbury\u00a0outreach organization.\n\"It refers to an injection that was administered without the consent of the person receiving the injection, which oftentimes can result in them falling asleep,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"In rare cases, it can lead to an overdose.\"\u00a0\nIn Depth\nAn Ontario coroner ruled Adam Danko's death was accidental. His family believes he was intentionally overdosed\nNorthern Ontario's 5 largest cities continue to have highest opioid death rates in province\nAli added\u00a0a hotshot\u00a0could also refer to a substance being contaminated with poison or another substance without the knowledge of the person using it. It could also apply to other ways of using drugs, such as inhalation.\n\"It seems to be an ill-intended act to gain something from the person who has experienced the hotshot,\" said Ali.\u00a0\nIn her experience, hotshot incidents are rare, but they do happen.\nJustin had a lot of valuable items with him the night he died, and Lalonde is convinced he was given a hotshot so he could be robbed of his belongings.\nInvestigating an overdose death is complex\nWhether Justin consented to using drugs\u00a0or consented to use one drug that turned out to be laced with another\u00a0are questions the coroner and police can't answer.\u00a0\n\"Overdose deaths are very complex\u00a0and come with unique challenges from an investigative standpoint,\" said Barry Ornella, a detective staff sergeant with Greater Sudbury police.\u00a0\nHe said\u00a0detectives are called to the scene when \"there is evidence outside of what one might expect in an overdose death.\"\nBarriault's body was found this spring in the basement of his friend's house. \n \n(Aya Dufour/CBC News)\nFor instance, signs of forced entry or witness testimony can suggest a crime may have been committed.\u00a0\nOrnella said\u00a0police look to speak with anyone who was present during the overdose, but they do not have the authority to compel people to share information.\u00a0\n\"The Charter of Rights and Freedoms allows everyone the right to silence, and people exercise that right.\"\u00a0\nOrnella added\u00a0that often, anyone who was with the person who overdosed is\u00a0reluctant to co-operate with a police investigation.\u00a0\n\"They're fearful they may somehow be criminally implicated,\" he said.\u00a0\nOrnella stressed\u00a0the Good Samaritan Act offers protection in that regard, but that investigators struggle to gain trust and co-operation from those who were there.\u00a0\n\"We would like to provide answers to the families,\" he said. \"But sometimes we can't because unfortunately individuals do not come forward and help us fill in the gaps.\"\u00a0\nStigmatization and secrecy surrounding\u00a0drug use adds another challenge.\u00a0\nBarry Ornella, a detective staff sergeant with the Greater Sudbury Police Service, says detectives are called to the scene when 'there is evidence outside of what one might expect in an overdose death.' \n \n(Aya Dufour/CBC News)\n\"People who use drugs may feel shame or reluctance to share their struggle with friends or family,\" said Ornella.\u00a0\n\"There's times where people use them behind closed doors, away from their support system.\"\u00a0\nHe added\u00a0that when people who use drugs are incapacitated by substances, their belongings can go missing, which adds another layer of complexity to the investigation.\nIf police wanted to press manslaughter or murder charges for a hotshot, they would need a lot of evidence as these are very serious charges.\n\"Undoubtedly, we would need the co-operation of witnesses to help us reach the point where we can identify the individual who knowingly supplied a lethal dose of a drug to an individual,\" said Ornella.\nThere have been over 40 overdose deaths in Greater Sudbury since the beginning of the year, according to Greater Sudbury police.\n \n(Aya Dufour/CBC News)\nHe said\u00a0some late manslaughter charges have been laid in recent years, but these involved\u00a0people who contaminated the drug supply.\u00a0\nThe Greater Sudbury Police Service says it has shifted its approach when it comes to cases that involve opioids, to focus on prevention work.\n\"We're not going to arrest our way out of the opioid crisis,\" said Ornella.\u00a0\nFamilies fear police will jump to conclusions\nMichelle Barriault and Christine Lalonde fear that, as Justin's\u00a0death\u00a0was ruled accidental, the investigation will not be thorough.\u00a0\nThey said\u00a0police told them they could not provide any assistance to retrieve Justin's cellphone or computer\u00a0\u2014 devices that may contain important information.\u00a0\nThe phone service provider, in turn, said they could not help locate the device, as this is the police service's mandate.\u00a0\nBarriault had a house on Bear Island and lived with three cats.\n \n(Submitted by Michelle Darriault)\nBut they did confirm the phone was used in the weeks that followed Justin's\u00a0death.\nThat information was relayed to police, but no attempt was made to retrieve the devices, according to Lalonde.\u00a0\n\"They told us that we are not in a movie, and this case will not be resolved in 45 minutes.\"\nA grieving that lasts a lifetime\nChristene Neville also lost her son, 34-year-old Christopher Neville, to an opioid overdose, on March 23, 2022.\u00a0\nHe had a history of fentanyl use, but had stopped using in the year before he died.\u00a0\nHe was found in a friend's apartment\u00a0and had been dead for seven hours when first responders were called to the scene.\n\"He was about to start a new job, he was healthy, he was happy,\" said Christene Neville, who cannot make sense of what happened.\nA few months after his death, she received a message from a woman alleging Christopher was intentionally overdosed to be robbed of his things.\u00a0\nBefore his death in March 2022, Christopher Neville had a strong and close relationship with his daughter, and was about to start a new chapter in his life, says his family.\n \n(Submitted by Christene Neville)\nShe forwarded the woman's contact information to the detective in charge of her case, but said\u00a0the police never reached out to this woman.\n\"I called [the detective] and asked, 'Why aren't you doing something?'\" recalled Christene. \"He tells me he is trying, but deep down, I feel he's not.\"\u00a0\nThe Barriault and Neville families\u00a0feel they have been robbed and their lives have been\u00a0forever changed.\u00a0\nJust before his death, Justin\u00a0was talking about becoming a father\u00a0and enrolling in Cambrian College.\u00a0\nAs for Christopher, he had a strong and close relationship with his daughter, and was about to start a new chapter in his life.\u00a0"},

There are more than 10,000 known chemicals in the PFAS family with a wide range of everyday uses.\n\"Everybody in Canada has exposure to some types of PFAS,\" said Miriam Diamond, a professor with the University of Toronto's School of the Environment.\nUniversity of Toronto Prof. Miriam Diamond holds one of the compostable paper bowls analyzed in her lab. That type of food container was found to have high levels of PFAS, often referred to as 'forever chemicals.'\n \n(Robert Krbavac)\nDiamond, who\u00a0researches how environmental contaminants get into the environment\u00a0and how people can be exposed to them, said PFAS are largely used for their water-repelling properties. They are in waterproof jackets, bike chain grease, ski wax, and even some fast food containers and popcorn bags.\nIn Canada, a small number of these chemicals, such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), are banned for their effects on the environment and human health.\n\"We know that some PFAS affect the immune system by reducing immune function,\" Diamond said.\n\"We know that some PFAS affect reproduction resulting in lower fertility, lower birth weight, babies and some complications of pregnancy. Some PFAS are carcinogenic, affecting liver and kidneys.\"\nAs with other polymers \u2014\u00a0substances with very large and complex molecules \u2014\u00a0the problems with PFAS occur when the substances start to degrade and break down, Diamond said.\n\"Like a plastic bag isn't harmful itself,\" she said.\n\"But polymers can break down over time, and when the building blocks come out of the structure, it's those building blocks that are available for uptake and that can cause toxicity.\"\nDiamond said PTFE \u2014\u00a0the chemical the North Bay plant will use \u2014\u00a0is especially stable and can take decades to degrade and cause problems.\nIn addition to coating non-stick frying pans, PTFE is\u00a0used on items\u00a0like gaskets and to build medical equipment, because it stays sterile.\nMany PFAS are often referred to as \"forever chemicals\" because they can stay in the environment for hundreds\u00a0or even thousands of years.\nLike many people in North Bay, Lloyd first became concerned about the Industrial Plastics Canada plant when the Narwhal \u2014\u00a0a Canadian publication that focuses on climate change and the environment \u2014\u00a0published \na piece about the facility\n.\n\"Now the company has said they won't be manufacturing PFAS. Very good,\" Lloyd said.\n\"But they will be using PFAS. They have said there will be no releases to water. Very good. What is much less clear is what the releases will be to the air.\"\nPast contamination\nLong before Industrial Plastics Canada decided to set up shop in North Bay, the northern Ontario city had experienced environmental contamination from PFAS that affected local waterways.\nFrom the 1970s to the mid-1990s, the Department of National Defence conducted training exercises near the city's airport, using firefighting foams that contain PFAS.\nBecause of those training exercises, a longstanding drinking water advisory remains in place for Lees Creek, which is southeast of the Jack Garland Airport.\nThe Department of National Defence has granted the city nearly $20 million to address the contamination.\nCity spokesperson Gord Young said\u00a0a study to determine the next course of action is nearly done.\nYoung said North Bay's drinking water currently has 53 nanograms of PFAS\u00a0per litre, while\u00a0the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks recommends no more than 70 nanograms of PFAS per litre.\nBut Health Canada has had consultations proposing that recommendation be lowered to 30 nanograms per litre.\nCurtis Avery is the environmental manager at Nipissing First Nation, west of North Bay.\n \n(Submitted by Nipissing First Nation)\nNipissing First Nation reacts\nSome members of Nipissing First Nation \u2014 located some\u00a030 kilometres west of North Bay\u00a0along the shore of Lake Nipissing \u2014 say they too are\u00a0worried about the plant.\n\"Our forests are places that we not only participate in our traditional activities such as hunting, fishing and ceremony, but also the forest, and the lake and the fish that we feed off of. All of this is connected to the land that we are situated in,\" said Curtis Avery, Nipissing First Nation's environmental manager.\n\"And when we have these issues with forever chemicals that are not part of that system, or part of that puzzle, that are here to stay and can bioaccumulate, not only are those animals and the food web affected, but it's also us, our people.\"\nAvery noted North Bay's past issues with PFAS contamination near the airport.\n\"So there's issues that already exist involving PFAS that should have been handled before we start bringing in some other major issues involving the same group of chemicals.\"\nNorth Bay Mayor Peter Chirico says Industrial Plastic Canada's plant won't affect local waterways.\n \n(Aya Dufour/Radio-Canada)\nThe city's response\nAfter the Narwhal published its article,\u00a0the City of North Bay said Industrial Plastics Canada would be setting up in an industrial park already zoned for the type of work it planned to do.\n\"IPC doesn't manufacture raw plastics on site and its operations itself will not have any impact on local water courses,\" North Bay Mayor Peter Chirico told CBC News.\n\"Air standards will obviously be required to comply with Ontario's environmental legislation and regulations, like all manufacturers that we presently have in the city of North Bay.\"\nChirico also noted that once the plant is fully operational, it's expected to employ around 35 people.\n\"We remain dedicated to protecting our natural environment, but also, you know, supporting job creation and business growth,\" he said.\n\"And we will continue to work with this company as we do with many other companies.\"\nCraig Rice, production manager at the Industrial Plastics Canada plant, says he has lived in North Bay his entire life and it's in his own personal best interest to ensure the plant doesn't negatively affect the city.\n \n(Jonathan Migneault/CBC)\nPlant visit\nIPC invited the CBC to tour the plant, although\u00a0the company did not allow for any recordings\u00a0or photos to be taken inside the facility.\nProduction manager Craig Rice explained how they receive PTFE in a powdered form from facilities in India and Italy.\nThe North Bay plant, while still under construction, contained pallets with hundreds of boxes with the powder \u2014 resembling icing sugar \u2014\u00a0inside.\nWhen the plant is operational, workers\u00a0will pour that powder into large cylindrical steel moulds \u2014\u00a0around a metre in height \u2014\u00a0that are cold-pressed and then baked in an oven at around 350 C.\nRice explained\u00a0cold-pressing the powder turns it\u00a0into a brittle piece that is then heated to become a\u00a0more durable solid.\nThose cylinders, called billets, are either sold to customers as is\u00a0or cut into thin sheets.\nRice said manufacturers use the material to make gaskets, seals, medical equipment and other products\n \nThe Ministry of the Environment is so squeezed by budget cuts that they don't have the capacity to provide full protective oversight.\n- Miriam Diamond, University of Toronto researcher\nIn a followup email, Rice said the company will need to obtain a permit from the Ministry of the Environment before it starts to use any ovens in the facility,\n\"The exhaust that is emitted from the oven is basically just hot air which we have tested in our other facilities\" he said.\n\"But under [Ontario] regulation, a permit must be obtained for any air discharged from the facility. Our engineering staff are in the process of getting this application completed and submitted to the Ministry of the Environment.\"\nRice added that not much dust is produced when cutting the billets, but employees will wear masks as a precaution when loading the PTFE powder into the moulds.\n\"We also have a high-tech vacuum unit in order for any cleanup if spillage occurs,\" he said.\nRice said he has\u00a0lived in North Bay all his life and has property on Lake Nipissing.

She and set associate producer Jeffrey Kohut joined Faith Fundal to share details of MA-BUHAY! debuting at the Winnipeg Fringe Festival.\nJeffrey Kohut, associate producer for the set of the musical, says the production is highly collaborative and was a way to invest in Filipino artists.\n\"Our real main purpose was to create a path for emerging [and professional] Filipino artists to professional theatre.\"\nKohut, who has been involved with the festival on and off since 2007, said it has a closer sense of community than those in larger cities.\n\"It's more centralized, geography wise, where all the venues are generally within walking distance, so there's a real sense of meeting people.\"\n'Take a risk'\nAs a producer, his favourite part of the festival has been getting to know and work with new generations of talent, and watch as they find their footing in Winnipeg's arts scene.\n\"It's just a great way to actually develop as an artist,\" said Kohut.\nPopp's suggestion for first-time Fringers is to \"take a risk\" and see a show.\n\"Try something you don't know if you'll like, because you never know what's going to come out of it,\" she said.\n\"You're seeing something snappy that might change your mind about something in the world or might really excite you.\"\nAll tickets are available for purchase in advance of\u00a0each show, according to Popp, and can be found \non the festival's website\n.\nThe Fringe Festival kicks off in Old Market Square\n21 hours ago\nDuration \n1:52\nFrom Storytelling events like 'Donating Sperm to My Sister's Wife' to stage plays like 'The Blabbermouth, The Puff Monster and The Wolf '\u2014 there's literally a performance for everyone at Winnipeg's Fringe Theatre Festival. It kicked off today at Old Market Square and our Matt Humphrey was there."},

Wallin was killed while Dotas and Hawes remain hospitalized in critical condition. Wrigley said Barakat also shot and injured a bystander.\nBut Officer Zach Robinson disabled Barakat's .223 -calibre rifle with a shot from his 9 mm handgun from 75 feet (22.86 metres) away, Wrigley said, leaving about 20 rounds still in the magazine. Robinson ordered Barakat 16 times to drop the handgun he continued to wave as he moved in closer and finally killed the suspect in a confrontation that lasted around two minutes, he said.\n\"In the wake of Mohamad Barakat's murderous, unprovoked attack, Officer Zach\u00a0Robinson's use of deadly force was reasonable, it was necessary, it was justified, and in all ways, it was lawful,\" Wrigley told reporters. \"Mohamad Barakat engaged in a savage attack. He unleashed what can only be described fairly a murderous barrage of fire. But that isn't to say it wasn't precise. In fact, it was.\"\nInvestigators found 1,800 rounds of ammunition, three long guns, four handguns, numerous ammo magazines, explosives, canisters with gasoline and a homemade hand grenade in Barakat's car, he said. Officials released a photograph showing that eight of the magazines bore American flag stickers or decals.\n\"When you look at the amount of ammunition this shooter had in his car, he was planning on more mayhem in our community,\" Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said at the news conference.\nPolice use of force justified, lawful: attorney general\nWrigley provided the most detailed account that authorities have yet given about what happened during the gunfight. But the focus was on whether Robinson's use of deadly force was justified. He said investigators are still trying to determine a motive for the attack on police, but promised more details on the investigation at a news conference planned for Friday where they will be joined by the FBI.\n\"He's casing the place up and stalking his way in and sizing up his opportunity and then parks there and spends minutes watching the officers and waits until they are literally walking,\" Wrigley said of Barakat. \"That's when he lifts his firearm out the window and begins firing. It was an absolute ambush. There's no other way to describe that.\"\n\"It's clear to us that our police officers were ambushed in this attack,\" the mayor added.\nShortly after the shooting, authorities, including the FBI, converged on a residential area about two\u00a0miles (3.2 kilometres) away and evacuated residents of an apartment building to gather what they said was related evidence.\nFargo Police Chief David Zibolski said he believed police previously had some sort of contact with Barakat \"but not anything significant.\"\nIn this image from video, law enforcement officers work at the scene of a shooting Friday, July 14, 2023, in Fargo, N.D. One police officer died and two others were critically injured in the shooting that also killed the suspect, police said. The shooting happened before 3 p.m. on a busy street. Multiple witnesses said a man opened fire on police officers before other officers shot the suspect. In a statement late Friday, police said a civilian also was seriously wounded.\n \n(WDAY-TV/The Associated Press)\nZibolski said it does not appear Barakat was involved in the car crash that brought officers to the scene. But he indicated investigators are trying to determine whether this was a planned ambush of officers.\nThe state Bureau of Criminal Investigation and FBI are leading the investigation. Robinson was placed on paid administrative leave while state authorities completed an investigation into his use of force, which is Fargo police procedure.\nThe funeral service for Wallin, 23, is set for Saturday morning in Pequot Lakes, Minn., according to an obituary.\nWallin served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and was deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq from November 2020 to July 2021. He and Hawes were sworn in less than three months ago and were still in training when they responded to the scene Friday.\nThe governors of Minnesota and North Dakota have directed U.S. and state flags to be flown at half-mast in honour of Wallin through sunset on Saturday, and encouraged residents and businesses to do the same."},

He said he's already used it when deciding who to hire for recent electrical and plumbing jobs and where to go out to eat,\u00a0to make sure he doesn't give his money to any businesses whose owners signed the petition.\n\"I'm not sure what my thoughts are going to be going forward long-term, knowing that some businesses had been misguided with misinformation \u2014 but I do know that for right now, I'm going to play it safe,\" he said."},

Elton Hall, who leads Winnipeg's organized crime division.\u00a0\nThe Winnipeg Police Service's firearms investigation and analysis section will become the provincial firearms examination centre.\nOnce the transition is complete, which Hall anticipates will take a year, he expects the new lab to be able to process 2,500 crime guns annually.\n\"The creation of a new crime-gun lab in Manitoba is going to make a substantial difference for officers across this province, as it will speed up the process significantly and help them get the evidence they need to lay the appropriate charges,\" Central Plains RCMP Insp. Paul Peddle said.\n\"We need to continue to do everything we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and to ensure they are quickly held to account when they do make the decision to use a firearm in the commission of an offence.

With the addition of the new lab, more equipment and examiners, results should be available within hours, Hall said.\n\"So it's really significant, especially when you're talking about a homicide investigation or multiple shootings. You now\u00a0 [will be able to] link crime scenes, you'll link potential suspects.\""},

"m-card-1.6909911", "content": "Seniors at risk of dementia who were given hearing aids and counselling had less cognitive decline over a three-year period, a randomized trial finds.\nResearch \npublished Monday in The Lancet medical journal\n found that at-risk seniors saw their rate of cognitive decline nearly cut in half over three years if they wore hearing aids,\u00a0compared to seniors who just received education.\u00a0\nWhile past research \nhas shown a link\n between hearing loss and cognitive decline, experts say this study supports the need for seniors to use devices to mitigate the risk.\nIn Canada, audiologists \nestimate\n that around three million people have some degree of hearing loss that could be improved with hearing aids, yet 80 per cent don't wear them.\n\"It's a testament that hearing intervention, it's not just improving your hearing;\u00a0there are a lot of cascading effects that we see now,\" said the study's co-principal investigator Dr. Frank Lin.\u00a0\nCBC Explains\nWhat over-the-counter hearing aids in the U.S. could mean for Canada\nLin, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, says the study shows that good hearing \"decreases loneliness, improves your social engagement, you become more active [and] it might take a load off your brain.\"\u00a0\nThe randomized control trial involved 977 participants, who were about 77 years old on average.\u00a0\nDr. Frank Lin is the study's lead author and a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n \n(Submitted by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine)\nSome people were considered healthy, while others had underlying conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, which put them at a greater risk for cognitive decline.\u00a0\nParticipants were randomly divided into two groups: one that got hearing aids with additional counselling and another that only took part in a successful aging health education class.\u00a0\nOver three years, researchers measured the level of cognitive decline between the two groups.\u00a0\nThere was no significant difference in cognition between the two groups overall, nor was there a notable difference for the healthy participants across both groups.\nBut when researchers looked at the\u00a0results\u00a0for just\u00a0the participants who were at higher risk of dementia, those who got hearing aids slowed their cognitive decline by 48 per cent over the study period.\nHow is hearing tied to dementia?\u00a0\nAccording to Lin, researchers suspect that there are three major ways hearing loss can impact the brain.\u00a0\nThe first, he said, is related to cognitive load, which means that there's excessive work being done by the brain to compensate for poor hearing.\u00a0\n\"Your brain is constantly getting a much more garbled signal from the ear,\" he said.\u00a0\"And we understand now that likely takes a toll on the brain.\"\u00a0\nMarilyn Reed is an audiology practice adviser at Baycrest Centre in Toronto.\u00a0She says the research findings weren't surprising, but do provide more robust support for the link between cognitive decline and hearing loss.\n \n(Jennifer La Grassa/CBC)\nThe brain is constantly reallocating resources to handle hearing as a result, and that might \"come at the expense\" of our thinking and memory, Lin said.\u00a0\nA second reason is that if the brain isn't getting enough auditory input, that can cause parts of it to shrink, said Lin.\u00a0\nAnd lastly, hearing loss can cause someone to withdraw and not be as socially engaged. This is also thought to contribute to brain atrophy.\u00a0\n\"The thing with hearing intervention [is that] it likely targets all those pathways:\u00a0it reduces load on the brain, provides more stimulation to the brain,\u00a0[and] at the same time, it helps you be more engaged with your life,\" said Lin.\u00a0\nStudy limits confounding factors\nWhile these study results aren't surprising to those in the industry, the methods used provide more robust support for the idea that hearing loss is tied to cognitive function.\u00a0\nThere's been a lot of research recently that shows hearing loss can be an early warning sign for potential decline, said\u00a0Kathy Pichora-Fuller, a professor emeritus in psychology at the University of Toronto not involved in the study.\nBut what stands out to the gerontologist and audiologist is that there weren't as many confounding factors due to the fact that participants were randomly assigned to either group.\u00a0\nThis would mean that lifestyle factors were relatively the same between the control and intervention groups.\u00a0\nTypically in studies done with hearing aids, Pichora-Fuller said they compare people who have them with those who don't.\u00a0\nReed is shown speaking with a patient who wears a hearing aid. Reed says routine hearing screening should be done for people 50 and older by primary-care doctors in order to better educate people and provide earlier intervention.\n \n(Jennifer La Grassa/CBC)\nBut Pichora-Fuller says people who already own hearing aids are often different: they may be more motivated, socially engaged, wealthier or have a higher education. All of these factors could be what helps preserve their mental state as they age.\u00a0\n\"Now we can compare apples to apples,\" she said about the new study.\u00a0\nShe says it's also important to know that the participants in this study were not only given hearing aids, but also engaged in continuous audio rehabilitation with an expert.\u00a0\nBarriers to getting hearing aids\nEven though the benefits of hearing aids have been clear for some time, those who work in the industry say patients are still reluctant to get them.\u00a0\n\"Hearing aids do have a stigma associated with them and it's very long-standing,\" said Marilyn Reed, an audiology practice advisor at Baycrest Centre in Toronto.\u00a0\n\"The way to overcome stigma is to really talk about the problem.\"\nManitobans call on province to help cover 'astronomical' hearing aid costs for people under 65\nThis starts with family doctors, Reed said.\u00a0Regular screening in people 50 and older in primary care, she said, can reduce shame, educate people and allow for earlier intervention.\u00a0\nAnother barrier is cost, said Reed: The most basic hearing aids available in Canada start at around $2,000 a pair.\nMost recently, the U.S. approved over-the-counter hearing aids, which has dramatically reduced the price. \nMany expect Canada will soon follow suit.\nAs for next steps with this research, Lin says they are going to continue to follow the people who started off healthy to track if they eventually see any benefit from the hearing aids.\u00a0\nHe says they also plan to do more research on whether there are long-term cognitive benefits with hearing aids and their ability to reduce rates of dementia."},

I was just, you know,\u00a0here's a promise of things are going to get a little bit easier and then no, that's swept away, that's gone.\"\nCindy Pickel is blind and uses a cane to get around. She said the process of applying for the Manitoba Support for Persons with Disabilities program left her feeling defeated. \n \n(Tyson Koschik/CBC)\nWhen it was announced last December, the Manitoba Support for Persons with Disabilities program was promoted as a new support for people with disabilities that would be separate from the general employment and income assistance (EIA) programs, and provide some additional benefits.\u00a0\nBut Pickel, and those who work with disabled Manitobans, say it's not clear who's actually eligible for the program, leading to frustration and disappointment within the community.\u00a0\nFurther, one hospital worker who helps people with life-altering disabilities says a legislative change has actually made it harder for people to qualify for financial assistance when they need it most.\u00a0\nConfusing process\u00a0\nPickel says she went through the intake process in June. Though she doesn't qualify for the general EIA benefit, she said she thought the Manitoba Support for Persons with Disabilities program could help her based on what provincial staff told her over the phone.\u00a0\n\"I was told that, yes, because I received CPP disability, I automatically qualified and absolutely I should come in.\"\nHowever, when she and her husband arrived for her intake appointment, she says she was asked questions meant for the EIA program.\u00a0\nCindy Pickel with her husband, Neal. \n \n(Tyson Koschik/CBC)\n\"I said 'I don't qualify for EIA. I'm not here to apply for EIA, I'm here to apply for the supports for Manitobans with disabilities program,'\" she said.\u00a0\n\"She explained to me that, or she stated to me, 'Just because you have a disability doesn't mean you're going to get money.'\"\nManitoba to launch disability income support program in 2023\nManitobans on disability now get $25 more a month, but as costs soar, some priced out of basic needs\nThat statement rubbed Pickel the wrong way. The intake worker then told her that if she was divorced, or if she and her husband sold some of their assets, she could qualify.\u00a0\nPickel said the whole process left her defeated.\u00a0\n\"It's not at all what I was told it would be.\"\nOngoing evaluation\nThe province opened up enrolment for the Manitoba Support for Persons with Disabilities program to Manitobans currently receiving EIA in the disability category on Jan. 1.\u00a0\nAccording to the province's website, the program is for Manitobans who have a severe and prolonged disability that challenges daily living, and are financially eligible for income assistance.\u00a0\nEnrolment opened up on April 1 to other eligible Manitobans who weren't already on EIA.\u00a0\nThe program offers an extra $100 per month over and above\u00a0the\u00a0EIA disability rates and about $44 a month for telephone and laundry. Basic need amounts are reviewed annually and indexed to the rate of inflation each July.\u00a0\nAccording to the province's website, \nas of July 2020\n,\u00a0Manitobans with a disability could receive $1,068 a month from EIA if they had no children, and between $1,445\u00a0and\u00a0$1,871\u00a0a month if they did have children.\u00a0\nSince April 1, the province has received approximately 1,000 applications for the new program, with about half of them now receiving benefits, said a spokesperson for the province.\u00a0\nThe average processing time for applications is about four months, the spokesperson said.\u00a0\nAsked about the concerns regarding eligibility, the spokesperson said the province is still working to generate additional awareness.\u00a0\n\"Recognizing that the program is new, the department is committed to ongoing evaluation and improvements to ensure Manitobans can access the information they need in a timely fashion,\" the spokesperson said via email.\u00a0\nCBC Investigates\nWinnipeg sisters say inadequate home-care funding leaves them paying out of pocket, $30K in debt\nCBC Investigates\nTenant with disability files human rights complaint against Winnipeg public housing project\nJason Hirose, a consultant with the Independent Living Resource Centre in Winnipeg, says he hasn't heard from anyone who's successfully applied for the program at this point. In fact, he says he and other staff at the centre haven't heard much about the program at all.\u00a0\nHe said he thinks it's because people are just fed up with dealing with the provincial government.\n\"I know a lot of people that are fed up with fighting, they're fed up of having to constantly struggle and feeling like they're not getting anywhere.\"\nFalling through the cracks\u00a0\nA Winnipeg hospital worker who helps patients who have newly acquired disabilities says she was also excited about the launch of the new financial support program, as many of her clients find it difficult to get by on the general EIA benefit.\u00a0\nBut in reality, she says the province has changed the qualifications, which is actually making things harder for her patients.\u00a0\nThe woman, who CBC isn't naming because she's concerned speaking out could put her job at risk, works with patients to set them up with the supports they need to transition out of hospital.\u00a0\nThe biggest issue she's facing is a legislative change.\u00a0\nUnder the Manitoba Assistance Act, as of April 1, a doctor must determine that a person will likely be unable to work due to a health issue for at least one year in order to qualify for income assistance.\u00a0\nIt was previously 90 days.\u00a0\nFor many of the patients she works with, it's hard for doctors to determine their prognosis that far out, she said.\u00a0\n\"For example, if you have a mental health illness, it's not that you're going to be off for a full year. Maybe you're having psychosis right now. It could get better. It could get worse,\" she said.\u00a0\n\"But you do need access [to support]. So basically, this just means like a lot of people who would have been eligible for disability benefits now aren't going to be, which is the problem.\"\nGrocery rebate in federal budget a drop in the bucket for Winnipeggers on tight budgets\nFirst Person\nMy fight for more home care is a fight for a lifetime of freedom\nA spokesperson for the provincial government said the change from 90 days to one\u00a0year aligns Manitoba's income support program with other jurisdictions across Canada, adding that all Manitobans facing financial hardship can access support through employment and income assistance.\u00a0\nWhen people have just acquired a disability, it can be difficult to know how it's going to impact your life long-term, said Melissa Graham, executive director of the Manitoba League of Persons with Disabilities.\u00a0\n\"There's a big difference between the first 90 days of a disability and a year,\" she said.\u00a0\nGraham says the program doesn't seem to be designed to meet the acute needs of people who find themselves with a recently\u00a0acquired disability.\n\"You can tell based on how this program is designed, that's not really who they had had in mind,\" she said.\u00a0"},

Duty to consult in this province is broken,\" Nippi-Albright said.\nThere are individual examples of partnership on resource projects. This week, the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation announced a deal with a subsidiary of the Foran Mining Corporation. It includes employment for band members, preferential contracting and annual payments at its planned copper and zinc mine located 500 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.

They can only prescribe the bare minimum that the Constitution requires. That could be risky as a strategy in the long term for the government.

But as Ralston, Wuttunee and others have noted, elders and academics are now revealing problematic details that include deceptive translations and omissions during negotiations.\nThough most treaties of the 1870s contain words such as \"cede\" and \"surrender,\" chiefs who signed the English document with an \"x\" believed they were to be equal partners and had no discussions of land below the \"depth of a plow.\"\n\"I think without a doubt I think it's it's relevant that we know more about what went into the treaty negotiations,\" he said.\nRalston said the Saskatchewan government may not feel it needs to compromise, but it may soon have no choice.\n\"The government of the day may not feel that they have political pressure to talk about [natural resource sharing].

affecting passenger flights.\n\"I am having regular conversations with the CEO of Nav Canada, including one this week to keep asking him for an update on the status of their staffing operations\" said Omar Alghabra.\u00a0\nNav Canada, the corporation that oversees Canada's air traffic controllers,\u00a0admits some summer flight delays have been caused by personnel shortages.\n\"We do certainly acknowledge the fact that we have had some staffing-related challenges,\" said Marie-Pier Berman, Nav Canada's vice-president and chief of operations.\nWith travel demand high, Canada's airports and airlines vow this summer won't be so bad\nThe union representing air traffic controllers in British Columbia\u00a0\nhas been sounding the alarm on staffing since 2021\n.\nBerman said Nav Canada is training more than 400 new employees now and that the organization hopes to increase that number.\nWATCH | Flying post COVID has been a bumpy ride:\u00a0\nAir traffic controller shortage driving this summer's flight delays, experts say\n2 days ago\nDuration \n2:03\nAfter last summer's airline worker shortage caused huge headaches for travellers, this summer's delays are being caused by Nav Canada's lack of air traffic controllers, according to industry insiders.\nUnlike in the United States, there is no publicly available data that breaks down why or how many flights are delayed, but the president of the Canadian Airports Council says the number of delays caused by a lack of air traffic controllers\u00a0has been noteworthy.\n\"Staffing shortages have impacted our air carrier flight schedules and airspace management from time to time and in major regions of the country,\" said Monette Pasher.\u00a0\"We have seen this most acutely in the B.C.\u00a0mainland airspace.\"\nPost-pandemic air travel in Canada has been marked by challenges, both because of a surge in demand, and because of labour shortages throughout the industry, many of which are\u00a0\nat least partially attributable to pandemic layoffs.\nPearson Airport turns to bolstered staffing, tech improvements to reduce travel chaos\n\"This summer we've seen a variety of run-of-the-mill delays that travellers are frankly very used to \u2026 thunderstorms, weather delays, issues related to congestion,\" said Duncan Dee, an aviation consultant and the former COO of Air Canada.\n\"What makes this summer particularly different with regard to delays is the fact that we've seen a tremendous number of delays related to shortages of air traffic controllers.\"\nDee says\u00a0he's tracked an increase in this type of delay\u00a0dating back to last summer, and notes they've become\u00a0more frequent since March.\nShortage follows pandemic layoffs\nIn 2020, Nav Canada announced it was cutting more than 720 jobs, representing about 14 per cent of its workforce.\u00a0It also terminated its training program during the pandemic.\nP.E.I. native Matthew Gillis, a mechanical engineer, had moved to two different\u00a0cities for on-the-job air traffic controller training,\u00a0then felt left in the lurch when that training was cancelled due to COVID-19.\n\"I'd invested years into this pursuit,\" he said. \"It certainly gutted me.\"\nNew Brunswick resident Matthew Gillis said he has neither the 'energy nor the appetite' to return to training to become an air traffic controller following cancellations and layoffs in the industry during the pandemic. \n \n(Ed Hunter/CBC )\nGillis has since found another job and moved to New Brunswick,\u00a0and though Nav Canada asked him if he would restart his training after the pandemic, he declined, saying he had neither the\u00a0\"energy nor the appetite.\"\u00a0\nStill, he said he takes no pleasure in seeing air traffic controller shortages causing delays.\n\"To know that Nav Canada management made this decision without planning for how it would impact the future of the organization to meet their service requirements is concerning,\" he said.\nNav Canada defends layoffs\n\"There were very difficult decisions that had to be made during the pandemic,\" said Berman. \"The reality is, we barely had any planes that were in the sky at that time.\"\nShe said cancelling the training program was a matter of safety, as there were strict physical distancing rules in place at the time.\u00a0\n'It's a monster': Behind the scenes at Canada's busiest airport before March break travel surge\nCanada is not the only country dealing with a shortage of air traffic controllers. Similar issues have been reported\u00a0\nin the United States\n.\nBerman said Nav Canada is currently focused on\u00a0recruiting and training the largest number of people possible to fix the labour shortage and keep operations running smoothly.\nNew bill could end 'finger pointing'\nIn June, Alghabra introduced a new proposed law, \nBill C-52,\n that he said will increase accountability when\u00a0flights are delayed.\n\"It will really deal with this issue of finger pointing because the sector is highly interconnected,\" the transport\u00a0minister said.\n\"Each organization should be responsible for their own operation and held accountable.\"\nIf passed, the law would require airports to publish their performance metrics publicly.\u00a0"},

It applies in provinces and territories that don't have carbon pricing systems that Ottawa considers sufficient in the national effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe federal policy \u2014 which includes both a tax on fossil fuels\u00a0and\u00a0rebates paid directly to households\u00a0\u2014 has been the subject of much political debate over the past four years.\nIt has also been the source of much confusion, which is understandable\u00a0because the policy is not exactly simple.\nThe federal carbon tax \u2014 and rebates \u2014 in a nutshell\nThe amount you pay in carbon tax\u00a0varies from fuel to fuel. More emissions-intensive fuels are subject to higher tax rates.\nThe amount you receive in rebates, meanwhile, depends on three criteria:\nThe size of your household.\nThe province you live in.\nWhether you live in a \nrural area\n or a \ncensus metropolitian area\n.\nYour rebate is unaffected by how much fuel you actually consume.\nThis is what creates the financial incentive to reduce your carbon emissions: your rebate is a fixed amount, but you have some control over how much fuel you use. The less fuel you consume, the less tax you pay.\nIf your fuel usage is below a certain level, your rebate will exceed what you pay in tax. The federal government says \n80 per cent of households get more money back in rebates\n than they pay in carbon taxes, directly.\nOf course, that's not the whole story. There are also indirect costs to consider. These are the carbon taxes paid by companies and passed along to you in the form of increased\u00a0prices on the goods and services you buy.\nIndirect costs are harder to calculate precisely, but there are estimates\u00a0from two different groups of economists\u00a0that give us a rough idea. These estimates vary depending on how much you spend and which province you live in.\nHere, we've tried to simplify all of these things into a single app.\nThe carbon tax calculator is a tool that helps you get a better sense of how the federal carbon tax is affecting your finances\u00a0when all these factors are combined.\nHow do things shake out for your household? Use the app below to figure that out.\nClick or tap on the \"i\" icons for more information about a particular component of the app.\n(If the app doesn't appear properly on your mobile device, \nclick here\n for a standalone version.)\n\u00a0\nA note for people in B.C., Quebec and the territories\nThis app only works for people living in the eight provinces where the federal carbon tax applies.\nThe federal policy does not apply in British Columbia, which has had its own broad-based carbon tax in place since 2008. Here is more information about the \nB.C. tax rates\n and the province's \nclimate action tax credit\n.\nQuebec has its own carbon pricing policy, too. The province has joined with California in a \ncap-and-trade system\n\u00a0that sees greenhouse gas emission credits bought and sold on a \ncarbon market\n.\nThe government of the Northwest Territories has also implemented its own carbon tax, which applies locally instead of the federal policy. Here are \nmore details on the N.W.T. system\n.\nThe federal carbon tax does apply in Yukon and Nunavut, but the details of the policy are a little different in those territories, in particular when it comes to the rebates.\nHere is \nYukon-specific information\n and \nNunanvut-specific information\n about how the rebates work in each jurisdiction.\nHow and when you get the rebates\nAll of the calculations in the app are based on the current federal carbon tax rate of $65 per tonne of CO2, which took effect on April 1, 2023.\nThe carbon tax follows the federal government's fiscal year, which runs from April 1 to March 31 of the following calendar year.\nThe rebates are paid in April, July, October\u00a0and January.\nHowever, the federal carbon tax didn't take effect in the Atlantic provinces until July 1, 2023.\nAs such, Atlantic Canadians will only pay the tax for three-quarters of the fiscal year\u00a0and will receive three quarters' worth of rebate\u00a0payments, instead of the four quarterly payments that people in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario will receive.\nResidents of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland receive rebates in July, October and January.\nIn New Brunswick, which was \na late joiner to the federal system in 2023\n, there will be no rebate payment in July but there will be a double payment in October, followed by the regular\u00a0quarterly payment in January.\nHome heating oil, commonly used in Atlantic Canada, is a type of diesel fuel that is subject to the federal carbon tax.\n \n(Craig Paisley/CBC)\nYou receive the payments the same way you receive your income tax refunds or other payments from the federal government. Often, that is through direct deposit into your bank account.\nThe official name of the rebates are \"Climate Action Incentive\" payments. They may show up on your bank statement as \"CAI\" or \"CANADA\" or \"FED\" or some combination of those terms.\nIn order to receive your rebate payment, you\u00a0\nneed to file your annual tax return\nThe carbon tax rate is set to increase by $15 per tonne annually, rising next to $80 per tonne on April 1, 2024.\nRebates will also increase as the tax rate increases.\nHow this app works\nThe app incorporates data from various official and independent sources to calculate your household's direct carbon tax costs, indirect costs and rebate amounts.\nThe direct cost data come from the Department of Finance.\nFor the specific tax rates on various fuels, see this link:\u00a0\nTable 1: Federal Fuel Charge\u00a0Rates for Listed Provinces\n.\nA man fills up his truck with gas.\n \n(Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press)\nFor the rebates, the source data also comes from the federal Finance Department.\nHere are the specific rebate amounts for \nall the provinces except New Brunswick\n, and for \nNew Brunswick, specifically\n.\nIndirect costs:\u00a0detailed methodology\nThe indirect cost estimates\u00a0come from two sources:\nthe Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO)\neconomists Jennifer Winter, Brett Dolter and G. Kent Fellows\nThe estimates from the PBO come\u00a0from the supplementary data provided alongside its \nDistributional Analysis of the Federal Fuel Charge\n, which was published on March 30, 2023.\nThe PBO shared this data upon request from CBC News, but\u00a0it is unable to certify or endorse any independent, external calculations made with the data.\nThe estimates from the other group of economists\u00a0are part of a \nresearch paper\n that was published in \nCanadian Public Policy, a\u00a0\npeer-reviewed journal that focuses on economic and social issues.\nThe calculations in their paper were originally done in 2020 dollars and based on a rate of $50 per tonne. Winter shared the underlying data and her advice in adapting it for the purpose of this CBC News app. The original estimates have been adjusted to a rate of $65 per tonne and for inflation\u00a0so that they are reported in terms of 2023 dollars in this app.\nBecause New Brunswick was a late joiner to the federal carbon tax, it was not included in the PBO's estimates of indirect costs, so only one estimate is available for that province.\nWhy do indirect costs vary by income and province?\nThe estimates of indirect costs depend on your household income and which province you live in.\nWhy is this?\nIncome is used as a proxy for spending. Roughly speaking, the more money a household makes, the more money that household is likely to spend. And the more they spend, the more they indirectly pay through price increases in the things they buy.\nIn their \nresearch paper\n, the\u00a0economists say \"our indirect carbon cost estimates are of the worst-case variety because we assume full pass-through of carbon pricing costs from businesses to households.\"\nIn their\u00a0paper, they use 10 discrete ranges of income for each province, each with a different estimate for indirect costs.\nIn the PBO estimates, there are five discrete ranges.\nThis is why the indirect-cost estimates in the app don't scale directly when you change your income input, but rather change suddenly when you pass a certain income threshold.\nThe CBC News carbon tax calculator app uses estimates from two independent sources on the indirect costs of the carbon tax on households through price increases in the goods and services they purchase.\n \n(Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)\nThe province you live in also matters.\nAs the economists explain in their paper, the estimates \"depend on each province's built environment and electricity profile, and household consumption patterns.\"\nFor those who really want to delve into the details of what that means:\u00a0check out \nAppendix A\n\u00a0from their paper.\nAfter Earth's hottest week on record, extreme weather surprises everyone \u2014 even climate scientists\nWhat on Earth?\nWhat is the economic cost of wildfire smoke?\nFor the rest of us:\u00a0it boils down to the fact that price increases due to the carbon tax will vary depending on where people live.\nPeople in rural Saskatchewan, for example, don't spend their money on the same things as people in downtown Toronto.\nAnd even when it comes to identical products, the price increase as a result of the carbon tax will vary from place to place depending on a variety of factors, including transportation-related costs.\nApp developed by Robson Fletcher, Nael Shiab, Robert Davidson, CBC News Labs.

But voicing them,\u00a0often through public consultations,\u00a0comes with the risk of\u00a0being labelled a\u00a0NIMBY, which Kettel\u00a0called \"pejorative.\"\n\"We're regular citizens,\" said Kettel. \"Everybody has the right to express themselves and\u00a0to be part of the community.\"\nWATCH |\u00a0Who is getting richer and who is being shut out, with no safe place to call home? \nBehind Closed Doors: Canada\u2019s Rental Crisis\n5 months ago\nDuration \n22:30\nWe investigate the impact the current housing crisis is having on low-income Canadians, and reveal who is being shut out with no safe place to call home.\nResident associations don't want to stop development altogether, Kettel\u00a0said, adding many want to help \"moderate\" growth and encourage new projects\u00a0to be in line with local neighbourhood character.\nNIMBY sentiment\u00a0is particularly directed toward \naffordable housing projects\n proposed in existing neighbourhoods, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).\nLeslie Evans, executive director of the Federation of Calgary Communities, an umbrella organization of more than 100 community associations,\u00a0says affordable housing developments often stir fears of increased\u00a0crime rates and lower\u00a0property values among locals, which aren't proven to be true.\nAnd while there will always be people who are \"stuck\" with\u00a0NIMBY views, they're a minority, she said, adding that most\u00a0residents often become more open to development after learning how it benefits the community.\nMinimum wage couldn't land you a 1-bedroom unit years ago. Now, it's even worse. Here's why\n'Not in my backyard': How discrimination is a barrier for those experiencing homelessness\n\"Labelling them NIMBY is a good way to dismiss people that may or may not have legitimate concern,\" said Evans.\n\"Lots of that is they don't necessarily understand what it is\u00a0and how to build great communities. To build great communities, we need\u00a0diversity of\u00a0people and housing.\"\nHow prevalent is the problem?\nJim Dunn, director of independent academic network the Canadian Housing Evidence Collaborative,\u00a0says\u00a0it's hard to quantify the number of potential housing units that could have been built but weren't because of NIMBY sentiment.\nBut people can\u00a0look at\u00a0municipal\u00a0land use maps for a sense of how neighbourhoods have been allowed to develop over time, Dunn said, pointing to Toronto's\u00a0\"yellowbelt.\"\nHuge swaths of the city's residential areas, shown in yellow, were historically zoned strictly for single-detached or semi-detached homes. That changed this year after \ncity council voted to allow\n the development of two, three and four-unit multiplexes throughout.\n\"A huge part of Nimbyism was actually enshrined in zoning legislation,\" said Dunn, adding that local politicians are put in a \"bind\" having to choose between supporting outraged constituents and\u00a0increasing housing supply.\nAreas shaded in yellow on the City of Toronto's land use map signify land slated for residential use. These areas were historically designated for single-family, detached home development until recent months when multiplexes became permitted citywide.\n \n(City of Toronto Official Plan)\nRecent data shows people are feeling and seeing the effects of\u00a0NIMBY\u00a0legislation and sentiment.\nAccording to a \nNovember survey\n\u00a0commissioned by non-profit\u00a0Habitat for Humanity Canada, 54 per cent of Canadians feel that NIMBY sentiment is one of the main barriers to making affordable housing available in neighbourhoods, with almost three in four\u00a0agreeing that people worry about the impact of affordable housing on their property values and neighbourhood.\n\"It's actually a really big problem, and it's a problem in every Canadian community,\" said Julia Deans, the non-profit's president and CEO.\u00a0Habitat for Humanity Canada helps\u00a0low-income families access affordable housing.\nCBC Explains\nHow long do Canadians in need have to wait for affordable housing? Depends where they live\nResidents' association takes Vancouver to court over agreement for Squamish Nation-led development\nGarden suites now legal in Toronto after appeal fails. But opponents still speaking out\nKevin Lee, the CEO of the Canadian Home Builders' Association, said despite existing \"appetite\" to build more within existing neighbourhoods, Nimbyism discourages developers from trying to build. In many cases, local opposition to housing developments can \"delay and sometimes completely derail projects.\"\n\"You're going to have so much opposition that it's just\u00a0... not worth the effort,\" said Lee.\nWho is the problem affecting?\u00a0\nCMHC says some Canadians \ndon't\u00a0have the means of accessing the housing\u00a0market\n, which is particularly more common in certain groups, such as people with disabilities. The latest data from the federal government shows \nmore than 250,000 people\n\u00a0are on affordable housing waiting lists across the country.\u00a0\nPeter\u00a0Waldkirch, a director of housing advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says that the people who\u00a0are hurt the most and pushed out\u00a0because of Nimbyism are those without \"power\" in society,\u00a0such as low-income earners, immigrants\u00a0and young people.\u00a0\nIn contrast, he said, those with\u00a0NIMBY views\u00a0often have more wealth, power and resources to advocate for their wants compared to\u00a0the general population and those looking to move into affordable housing developments.\nPoliticians point fingers on housing crisis, but calls growing for more co-operation\nAs rents soar, tenants organize local protests. But what's needed for a national housing movement?\nBut their advocacy may be helping drive the very same system emptying their neighbourhoods and businesses\u00a0and keeping their children and grandchildren from becoming homeowners, he said.\n\"I think a lot of NIMBYs don't realize the harm they are causing.\"\u00a0\nCMHC\u00a0has said at the current pace of construction,\u00a0\nCanada is still short on housing supply\n. It projects almost 2.3 million housing units will be added to the market by 2030, bringing the country's total housing stock to 19 million \u2014 but that's 3.5 million units short of achieving \"housing affordability for everyone living in Canada.\"\nAnd when housing does get built, Waldkirch said\u00a0it's further from cities and their cores and into\u00a0the \"least desirable parts,\" far from jobs and amenities,\u00a0impacting\u00a0the community in ways beyond housing.\n\"It's bad for affordability, it's bad for environment\u00a0and it's bad for the economy,\" said Waldkirch.\nHow do we counteract it?\nDeans says Habitat for Humanity has leveraged different methods to get communities on board with affordable housing projects.\nIn Calgary, the local chapter has sent\u00a0personalized letters from families moving into new affordable housing buildings to local residents, she said.\u00a0In Winnipeg\u00a0branch conducts door-to-door canvassing, public meetings with local residents\u00a0and councillors and invites neighbours to help\u00a0build the very housing units incoming families will inhabit.\n\"That gives them an investment in that home, too,\" said Deans. \"Sometimes communities need a reminder of what their priorities might be.\"\nVolunteer builders with Habitat for Humanity Canada help construct community houses through the Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project in Winnipeg in 2017. \n \n(Submitted by Habitat for Humanity Canada)\nDunn says the rise of pro-housing\u00a0groups and the relaxing of local land zone restrictions\u00a0may be\u00a0a sign NIMBY sentiment is becoming less common. But to keep the momentum going, he suggests giving people less \"recourse\" in legislation to oppose developments and making it easier to finance and build new developments, like Toronto\u00a0multiplexes.\n\"There will be improvement, but there's still some obstacles to overcome,\" said Dunn.\nThat's why\u00a0Waldkirch says it's important for neighbours who say \"yes\" to development\u00a0to publicly support\u00a0new housing projects. This is especially the case for renters and young people, who he said have been \"extremely under-represented\" in municipal elections and in housing planning processes.\nAnalysis\nHow will Canada meet housing targets when there's a construction slowdown?\nBlaming immigration for the country's housing crisis disguises the real problem, analysts say\u00a0\n\"Get engaged. Show up and say 'yes' to housing,\"\u00a0said Waldkirch.\n\"It's easy for people to show up and say 'no' to housing, and that's how it's been for\u00a0decades.\"\u00a0\nLee says at this point in the housing shortage,\u00a0more housing units of all types are needed everywhere, not just in certain places, adding that's why builders, municipalities and provinces need to commit to reducing Nimbyism and\u00a0\"build smartly upwards, inwards and outwards.\"\u00a0\n\"It's definitely not about building a whole bunch of towers.

Neill noted that while trends come and go, they tend to have a longer lifespan when they have a cultural tie-in.\nAlison Neill, the senior director of global brand strategy at Aldo, is shown in front of the company's official Barbie product line.\n \n(CBC)\nAldo's\u00a0collection has been popular \non TikTok\n, where the\u00a0hashtag\u00a0#TikTokMadeMeBuyIt\u00a0led to some of its success, said Neill.

Her\u00a015-piece capsule collection features a mix of styles for women and children\u00a0\u2014 and is pink as far as the eye can see.\n\"We actually didn't know the film was coming out when we first were in talks about the collection, because it was back in 2021,\" MacMillan told CBC News from her Toronto studio.\nWhen \nBarbie\n was announced, she said, \"We were like:\u00a0Here, it's coming, Barbiecore \u2014 we're going to be here.\"\n\"It's going to be an explosion of all things pink, all things Barbie. And so we felt like it was the perfect time. It all lined up perfectly for us.\"\nToronto fashion designer Hilary MacMillan has also released a Barbie-inspired clothing line, coinciding with the film's release.\n \n(CBC)\nThe Barbie doll has had a complex history since it was launched in 1959. While it was invented to be a career-oriented doll for young girls, its prototype \u2014 blond, white, impossibly thin \u2014 has since been frequently upheld as a symbol of unattainable beauty standards.\nA new line of Barbie dolls introduced in 2016 was aimed at bringing\u00a0the brand into the 21st century, with more racial and body diversity. Some of the dolls used wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs; a \nlater collection\n introduced Barbies\u00a0who were bald or who had vitiligo, a skin pigmentation condition.\nGroup Chat\nHow did we end up in a Barbie world?\nLong Read\nThink pink, think Barbie? How the doll changed the way we think about colour\n\"They've really dedicated a lot of effort and time into creating dolls of more sizes and of races and of different occupations, and kind of really being a brand that's trying to show that girls and women can do whatever they want,\" said MacMillan.\n\"I think the direction that they're heading in is kind of what speaks to our brand, because we are so cognitive and aware of diversity and size inclusion and offering more things to women.\"\nProducts that make you scratch your head\nSameer Hosany, a professor of marketing at the Royal Holloway University of London who has written about \nthe brand's long-term popularity\n, predicts there will be winners and losers from the Barbie marketing campaign, depending on how much a product\u00a0aligns with the brand.\nEven beyond the movie, he said, \"a lot of the corporations are tapping [into] the renaissance of Barbie itself \u2014 and that's why you would see [a] collaboration wave from designer brands to accessories, high fashion, shoes.\"\nWATCH |\u00a0Ryan Gosling surprises a CBC reporter on the red carpet:\n#TheMoment Ryan Gosling surprised a reporter on live TV\n18 days ago\nDuration \n1:33\nRyan Gosling decided to crash CBC reporter Eli Glasner\u2019s live TV hit on the Barbie pink carpet in Toronto.\n\"It's just because of that immediate fit of Barbie cutting across a number of product categories and brands,\" said Hosany, which is what makes a potential collaboration successful.\u00a0\nThe Lego Movie\n, for example, wouldn't warrant the same level of brand collaboration, he said.\nA handful of Barbie-inspired products might make you scratch your head. There is a Barbie Xbox, a Barbie rug, Barbie candles, glassware and electric toothbrushes. Progressive Insurance released a Barbie-inspired commercial starring Flo, the fictional salesperson who regularly appears in its ads.\u00a0\nAt Burger King locations in Brazil, customers can order a \"\nBarbie burger\n,\" which is a beef patty paired with cheese, bacon bits and slathered in a bright pink sauce that the fast-food chain described as \"smoky.\"\nBurger King Brazil unveils limited edition Pink Burger and Barbie Shake to celebrate the release of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Barbie?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Barbie</a>.<br><br>Out tomorrow, July 12. <a href=\"https://t.co/EM98BroZvz\">pic.twitter.com/EM98BroZvz</a>\n&mdash;\n@PopCrave\nCross-promotion can be a high-risk strategy, said Hosany, as each brand's reputation depends on the other's. There's also the risk of \"brand dilution,\" in which a brand's reputation or value suffers because it releases a product at odds with its usual standards.\n\"A lot of this collaboration has been sort of very carefully selected,\" said Hosany.\nDespite\u00a0a number of other companies\u00a0jumping on the Barbiecore trend, putting their brightest pink products on display, MacMillan\u00a0said she isn't concerned about the ubiquity of the Barbie marketing campaign when it comes to her brand.\n\"I think our collection offers [something] a little bit different. It's not just like Barbie logos slashed across bucket hats or sweaters,\" she said.\n\"It's a little bit more elevated, Barbie-inspired, you know \u2014 nods of it. We have a specific kind of client for that. And so the more than merrier is kind of my mantra on it.\""},

They've been divided into eight groups of four for round-robin play. The top two in each group advance to the knockout stage, starting Aug. 5. The final goes Aug. 20 in Sydney.\nThe group stage kicks off Thursday at 3 a.m. ET with co-host New Zealand facing Norway in Auckland. The other co-host, Australia, will take on Ireland at 6 a.m. ET in front of an expected crowd of\u00a0\nmore than 80,000\n\u00a0in Sydney. Then Canada meets Nigeria at 10:30 p.m. ET in Melbourne to complete day 1.\nThe prize money has expanded too.\nA player-led push for FIFA to equalize payments for the men's and women's World Cups didn't achieve that lofty goal. But soccer's global governing body still increased its Women's World Cup fund\u00a0\u2014 covering prize money, team preparation and compensation to players' clubs\u00a0\u2014 from a total of $40 million US in 2019 to $152 million.\nFIFA also met the players' demand for a portion of the prize money to be paid directly to them, rather than all going to their national federations to dole out. Each of the 732 players in the tournament will receive at least $30,000, with the opportunity to earn more based on how far their teams advance. For example, players reaching the quarterfinals will be paid $90,000, semifinalists $165,000 and the champions $270,000.\nWATCH |\u00a0CBC Sports'\u00a0Shireen Ahmed explores journey of Canadian women's team:\nVideo Essay: Canada's women's soccer team ready for the World Cup\n3 days ago\nDuration \n2:54\nCBC's Shireen Ahmed takes us through the journey Canada's women's national soccer team has been through, from winning Olympic gold, to the challenge facing them at the World Cup.\nThe United States is favoured for an unprecedented three-peat.\nNo country has ever won the women's or men's World Cup three consecutive times. But the U.S., which has captured half of the eight Women's World Cups, is the betting favourite to go back-to-back-to-back after hoisting the trophy in 2015 in Canada and 2019 in France.\nThe top-ranked American team is loaded with big-name veterans like Megan Rapinoe, the winner of both the Golden Boot (top scorer) and Golden Ball (tournament MVP) at the 2019 World Cup; and Alex Morgan, whose 121 career international goals put her behind only Canada's\u00a0\nChristine Sinclair\n\u00a0(an all-time record 190) among active players. This will be their final World Cup together as Rapinoe, 38, announced she'll retire at the end of season. Morgan, 34, looks like she has at least one more left after leading the National Women's Soccer League in scoring last season with 15 goals in 17 games.\nEither way, the big red, white and blue machine will probably keep rolling with up-and-coming stars like Sophia Smith, a 22-year-old attacker who last season became the NWSL's youngest-ever MVP; and forward Trinity Rodman, the 21-year-old daughter of basketball great Dennis Rodman.\nBut the Americans are hardly prohibitive favourites.\nThe betting odds suggest a competitive battle for the trophy, with the United States' implied chance of winning (about 30 per cent) not terribly higher than England and Spain's (both around 18 per cent). Germany (about 11 per cent), host Australia (9 per cent) and France (8 per cent) are the other teams with at least a 5 per cent chance of capturing the title, according to the betting markets.\nBottom line: the Americans are still the team to beat. But they can be beaten. And their fa\u00e7ade of invincibility was punctured by their upset loss in the 2021 Olympic semifinals to Canada, a team they hadn't lost to in 20 years.\nNon-American stars who could tip the odds in their team's favour include brilliant Australia striker Sam Kerr; Spain midfielders Alexia Putellas (the two-time reigning world player of the year) and Aitana Bonmati (2022-23 Women's Champions League MVP); and Brazil's Debinha and Marta.\nThis will be the final World Cup for the 37-year-old Marta, a six-time world player of the year who has never lifted the World Cup in five previous appearances. She'll try to pull off her own version of long-suffering Argentine star Lionel Messi's victory in last year's men's World Cup.\nCanada is a long shot.\nThe world's seventh-ranked team is a fringe top-10 in the betting markets. Canada is listed at around 30-1, implying just over a 3 per cent probability of winning the tournament.\nThat might seem disrespectful toward the reigning Olympic champions (and 2012 and '16 bronze medallists). But Canada's performances in the Women's World Cup have been relatively unimpressive. In five trips, the country has reached the semifinals only once\u00a0\u2014 in 2003, when it lost the bronze game to the Americans. More recently, the Canadians were eliminated in the quarterfinals as hosts in 2015 before getting bounced in the round of 16 four years ago in France.\nAlso, Canada will have to work to advance out of Group B, which some have labelled the\u00a0\nGroup of Death\n. After Thursday night's matchup vs. 40th-ranked Nigeria, Canada faces No. 22 Ireland on July 26 at 8 a.m. ET and 10th-ranked host Australia on July 31 at 6 a.m. ET.\nIf the Canadians, as expected, place second in the group, their opponent in the round of 16 will likely be fourth-ranked England, who many consider the second-best team in the tournament behind the U.S.\nFor coach Bev Priestman's team to go deep, it will need to tap into the nourishing team spirit that carried it to that surprising Olympic gold medal in 2021. An \"us against everybody\" attitude might be even more ingrained now as the squad wages its bitter labour fight with Canada Soccer, the dilapidated federation that failed to provide the Olympic champs with a first-class World Cup prep.\nInjuries have already put a dent in the tournament.\nThe somewhat mysterious cascade of\u00a0\nwrecked knees in women's soccer\n\u00a0has knocked some key players out of the World Cup. They include Canadian forward Janine Beckie, rising U.S. star Catarina Macario, Netherlands forward Vivianne Miedema, and England's Leah Williamson, Fran Kirby and Beth Mead.\nOther standout players made it back from torn ACLs but could be diminished. Marta might come off the bench for Brazil, while Putellas raised doubts about her health by\u00a0\nleaving Spain's practice early\n\u00a0today, putting her status for Friday's match vs. Costa Rica in question."},

The system was created to separate Indigenous children from their families and assimilate them into mainstream society, the commission said.\nThe system operated countrywide for more than a century, with a government-estimated 150,000 children passing through it, often being subjected to neglect, malnutrition and physical, psychological and sexual abuse.\nThe House of Commons last year unanimously \nadopted a motion\n urging the Liberals to recognize residential schools as genocide.\nThe NCTR has documented more than 4,000 deaths in the residential school system.\nDecision to call witnesses welcomed\nSpecial interlocutor Murray said she welcomed the committee's decision to summon witnesses to explain themselves.\n\"It's the right thing to do,\" she said.\n\"It puts a little bit of a spotlight on those entities directly, and so [they can]\u00a0be exposed to questioning as opposed to just delivering the narrative they deliver.\"\nResidential school denialists tried to dig up suspected unmarked graves in Kamloops, B.C., report finds\nInternational commission looks to ease fears over unmarked graves contract\nAccess to some records remains contentious. The\u00a0NCTR says it continues to seek things like archival Catholic Church documents and\u00a0provincial and territorial vital statistics and coroner's\u00a0reports.\nIn an appendix, the committee names\u00a0Library and Archives Canada, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, provincial and territorial governments, and eight Roman Catholic religious bodies as those who have\u00a0outstanding records, according to the NCTR.\nMurray said there are likely more.\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court of Canada\u00a0\nhas ordered the destruction of documents\n, deemed confidential, that contain sensitive stories of abuse collected under the 2006 Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement, unless an individual consents to their preservation, a concern for both offices.\nStephanie Scott, NCTR executive director, said the centre\u00a0works hard\u00a0to obtain records from groups like the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a Catholic order that ran dozens of residential schools, but has found the process challenging at times \u2014 dealing with priests whose bosses are in Rome, for instance.\n\"It's lengthy. It's complicated,\" she said.\n\"I hope that when the Senate compels them to come that they have an answer as to why and what the hold up is.\"\nThat's the intention, according to Francis.\n\"Until we have the proper records, this work will not be complete,\" he said in an interview.\n\"It's critically important to raise that awareness.\""},

Indigenous leaders call for immediate implementation of P.A. police recommendations\n18 hours ago\nDuration \n2:13\nIndigenous leaders are calling for the Prince Albert Police Service and its governing bodies to swiftly implement dozens of recommendations stemming from an independent review of policing in the northern Saskatchewan city.\nThe Prince Albert Grand Council (PAGC), which represents 12 First Nations and 28 northern communities, wants one of the recommendations to be expanded, however.\nRecommendation 28 states the provincial government should have a representative on the board of police commissioners, because of its funding contributions to public safety and policing in Prince Albert.\nBrian Hardlotte, grand Chief of the Prince Albert Grand Council, right, wants the grand council to be represented on the Prince Albert board of police commissioners.\n \n(Travis Reddaway/CBC)\nGrand Chief Brian Hardlotte said Tuesday that the grand council ought to have a representative on the board as well.\n\"Their inclusion will contribute valuable perspective, insights and expertise in the decision-making process, and ensure there is community representation on the board,\" Hardlotte said.\n\"This will make sure our community's voice is heard and respected.\"\nCollaboration between the board and grand council would further help keep the community safe, he said.\nHardlotte noted that the recommendations did not specifically mention elders or cultural training.\nSupport for family of Saul Laliberte\nLeadership from the FSIN, the PAGC\u00a0and Cumberland House Cree Nation publicly announced their support for the family of Saul Laliberte\u00a0during Wednesday's news conference.\n\"It's about humanity,\" Hardlotte said. \"We can't continue treating people like this \u2014 vulnerable people like this.\"\nLaliberte, 33, was taken to the Prince Albert\u00a0Police Service's detention facility during the afternoon of Nov. 7, 2021, police say.\nOn Wednesday, Lerat said Laliberte's mother was concerned for her son's wellbeing during his arrest and contacted police, asking that he be taken to the hospital because she believed he was at risk.\nThe request was ignored, Lerat said.\nLaliberte was found unresponsive in his cell that evening and sent to hospital, where he was declared dead, police say.\nPrince Albert police officer charged with negligence causing death of man in police custody\nDavid Pratt, 1st vice chief of the FSIN, told reporters that an autopsy showing the cause of death has not been released yet.\nLaliberte's death, as well as the deaths of two other men incarcerated in Prince Albert around that time, were part of the reason Tell ordered the review into the Prince Albert police.\nThe Saskatoon Police Service investigated Laliberte's death. The investigation led to an officer, who served for 21 years, recently being charged with criminal negligence causing death and failing to provide the necessities of life.\nThe officer was relieved from active duty, pending the outcome of court proceedings.\nThe officer is scheduled to appear in provincial court on July 25, police say.\nAmelia Bloomfield, Laliberte's mother, and one of her sons attended the news conference, but did not want to speak to reporters.\nCumberland House Cree Nation Chief Rene Chaboyer, right, spoke to reporters on behalf of members of Saul Laliberte's Wednesday, including his mother, Amelia Bloomfield, centre.\n \n(Travis Reddaway/CBC)\n\"We're here to support them as much as we can,\" said Cumberland House Cree Nation Chief Rene Chaboyer.\n\"We recognize there are recommendations out there, but there's still a gap that needs to be filled to actually see action, and initiate these plans moving forward.\"\nPratt said the FSIN will also be supporting the family \"in whatever way they decide to move forward,\" including legal action.\nHe described Laliberte's death as \"another unnecessary death at the hands of police.\" The federation, he said, is calling for more accountability and respect for Indigenous people.\nLerat, on behalf of the FSIN, called for all police forces, including the RCMP, to stop arresting people for intoxication. He called it an inhumane practice\u00a0and said it should be a responsibility for health authorities."},

There's still no resolution.\nOn June 19, the STF said in a \nnews release\n that Jason Young sidestepped the division's local bargaining committee \u2014 which it's been in negotiations with since 2021 \u2014 by forwarding staff terms of a potential deal that weren't yet discussed at the bargaining table.\u00a0\nThe STF is urging teachers (including substitutes) in the north not to apply or accept contracts with the division until the director rescinds the letter and acknowledges the move was out of process. The STF says teachers that do would\u00a0be violating the federation's code of collective interests and could have their names included in STF publications circulated across the country.\n\"Until we can ensure that the process is going to be respected, that we can protect that collective bargaining process, we have to have a corrective action before we can see anything continue to ensure that negotiations happen in good faith,\" STF president Samantha Becotte told CBC News in the days after the designation.\n\"This isn't a decision that the provincial executive made lightly.\"\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, an\u00a0STF spokesperson said Becotte's comments still stand.\nThe Northern Lights School Division didn't respond to CBC News's latest request for comment.\nHowever, in an emailed statement roughly a week after the division was placed in dispute, NLSD\u00a0acting director Dawn Kuppenbender didn't address the federation's accusations.\u00a0\nInstead,\u00a0she pointed to the stalled negotiations between the division and its local bargaining committee.\n\"We are committed to a good faith and fair bargaining process for both the employer and teachers. We sincerely believe that we, the parties to this negotiation, should be able to agree on one of the processes for dispute resolution outlined in The Education Act,\" Kuppenbender wrote, noting that mediation, arbitration and conciliation are all possible options.\n\"We remain willing and eager to return to the bargaining table with the local committee at any time to negotiate a fair collective agreement and are prepared to consider any new proposals carefully.\"\nThe local bargaining committee president confirmed late Wednesday afternoon that there had been no new developments.\nSaskatchewan Teachers' Federation not satisfied with province's initial proposal for new contract\nSask. gov't announces $40M for school divisions, teacher's federation says it's not enough\nAccording to Charles Smith, an associate professor of political studies at the University of Saskatchewan's St. Thomas More College, the STF could be trying to send a message about bargaining as it continues separate contract negotiations with the provincial government.\n\"The STF is saying publicly, 'Listen, rules have to be followed and we are coming to the table with some serious demands that have to be taken seriously,'\" he said.\u00a0\n\"That, to me, is just good union practices \u2014 you use the tools in your toolkit to come to an agreement. And they have this tool, and it's certainly a powerful one.\"\nThe federation has put divisions in dispute 14 times since 1961.\u00a0\nMost recently, the now non-existent Leader School Division was given the status in May 2002. In that case, there was a mediation process and the designation was lifted roughly two months later."}
