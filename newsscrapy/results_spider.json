The issue was raised at the National Assembly after a school in Rouyn-Noranda said it planned to offer them.\n \n \"So I definitely felt disappointed when I saw his comments because it disregards, in a way, trans and non-binary students' safety,\" said trans activist Celeste Trianon, who runs the Quebec Trans ID Clinic. \n \n \"And the consequence of that is that it's going to lead to othering of trans and non-binary students who are not going to feel safe at school, as would be the case with full-blown gender-neutral washrooms as is being proposed at that school in Abitibi.\"\n \n The education minister was reacting to news that the École d'Iberville had started work to provide mixed-gender bathrooms for students for the 2024-2025 school year. The proposed bathrooms would have floor-to-ceiling stalls with a shared sink area.\n \n A petition was launched to oppose the project.\n \n \"We don't think it's a good idea,\" said Drainville in a press scrum on Tuesday, the first day of the parliamentary session resuming in Quebec City. \"The school needs to get its act together.\"\n \n The minister said he prefers bathrooms for boys and bathrooms for girls but is open to the idea of having individual mixed bathrooms.\n \n \"There are already [individual] mixed bathrooms in the schools. I know because I visit them. So I think this could be a reasonable way of showing respect for diversity while ensuring that our boys and girls, men and women, have their intimate space when they go into the bathroom or washroom in any school.\"\n \n \nTrans activist Celeste Trianon is a law student at the Université de Montréal and promotes trans rights in the city. SOURCE: Celeste Trianon/Facebook\n \n Speaking to reporters, he cited privacy concerns among teenage female students going through puberty who could potentially face harassment from male students who share the same bathroom.\n \n \"A 12-, 13-, 14-year-old girl who starts menstruating, for example, and comes out of the cubicle, then there are 13-, 14-year-old boys looking at her. Mockery, sarcasm, humiliation: a scenario we don't want, so I think we need to draw a line and the line is being drawn now.\"\n \n Trianon didn't share the same level of concern, saying that the minister's comments reinforce her opinion that schools need to ensure adequate sex education is taught in schools to prevent ridicule \"of what is a perfectly normal bodily function.\" She also said teachers and staff should be equipped to deal with harassment on school property when it occurs. \n \n \"Ultimately, many of the demands that trans and non-binary people have in society is to make sure they have an equitable chance at living their best lives, getting employment, be able to complete school, etc. It's all these factors combined here,\" Trianon said.\n \n Earlier in the morning, Parti Québécois leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon called for a parliamentary commission on certain issues up for debate, including gender-neutral bathrooms, the use of pronouns for non-binary people, and young people beginning the transition process to change their gender.\n \n \"I see a lot of ideology coming from the radical left being imposed, and then that's where I have an issue when concepts are imposed, ways of doing new programs in the education system without any prior democratic debate,\" he said.\n \n Québec solidaire (QS) spokesman Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois compared his PQ opponent to federal Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, \nwhose party voted to ban gender transitions for people under 18\n.\n \n \"Trans kids are eight times more likely to commit suicide than other kids,\" Nadeau-Dubois argued.\n \n \"That's not the ideology of the radical left, it's a fact. I think politicians should leave these kids alone. The children I'm talking about this morning are the one in five children in Quebec who don't get enough to eat in school. I think we need to talk about that.\"\n \n \nWith files from The Canadian Press \n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

That includes Zexi Li, who filed a class-action lawsuit against the organizers on behalf of people who live and work in downtown Ottawa.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf they're allowed to testify, the witnesses are expected to speak about the blocked streets, the constant sound of horns honking and truck engines running, the oppressive smell of exhaust, witnessing public urination and being unable leave their homes, the Crown said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Crown also intends to call the owner of a women's clothing boutique and employees from the National Arts Centre, and the public transit operator.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Crown had planned to call an employee from the Fairmont Chateau Laurier hotel, but has since decided against it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLich and Barber have already signed admissions that the \"actions of certain individuals\" who participated in the protest interfered with public transit and the lawful use and enjoyment of property and businesses.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There's is absolutely no need to call these nine witnesses,\" Greenspon said, arguing their testimony would be irrelevant in a strictly legal sense.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe witnesses didn't have any direct interactions with Lich or Barber, and the organizers have not admitted to playing any role in the disruptions.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe admission did not go far enough to justify blocking the testimony of people directly impacted by the protest, Wetscher argued.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I don't think that Mr. Greenspon is in a position to admit that the protest is not peaceful,\" Wetscher said. The Crown has already alleged that the protest was \"anything but\" peaceful.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Crown wants to show exactly how disruption, intimidation and obstructions manifested after thousands of big-rigs rolled into Ottawa in early 2022, blocking roads in what the city's mayor at the time called a \"siege\" and an \"illegal occupation.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJustice Heather Perkins-McVey said the question about whether the protest was peaceful doesn't affect the charges Barber and Lich are facing, but could be an aggravating factor.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe two organizers face charges of mischief and counselling others to commit mischief, intimidation and obstructing police.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBarber is also charged with encouraging others to break a court order that banned horn-honking during the protest, which was part of an injunction issued in response to Li's lawsuit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWetscher argued that the Crown is entitled to call the evidence it sees fit to connect Lich and Barber's words and actions to the residents and workers from downtown Ottawa.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The Crown maintains the best evidence will come from the civilians,\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe witnesses won't be allowed to speak about the impact the protest had on them personally, and Perkins-McVey said she would strongly enforce that as a gatekeeper if she allows them to give evidence.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It'll be a very tight gate. There will be lots of locks on that gate,\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPerkins-McVey said the court heard from the first witness, Ottawa police Insp. Russell Lucas, that the protest was fragmented and that different people protested for different reasons.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat will make it difficult for the Crown to pin the observations of Ottawa locals to the actions of Lich and Barber.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I don't know if this evidence is going to have the weight that you hope,\" she told Wetscher.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 11, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

You hit some good shots, you'll have some really bad shots. You laugh about it and you move on, and take another shot maybe.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Whether you're walking or you're riding, if you're a complete health nut, that is perfect,\" said Lee. \"If you're coming out and you're going to enjoy a couple beverages while you're out there playing, making sure you have a safe ride home afterwards, everything is par for the course if you can come out and play.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWeather permitting, Saskatoon golf courses will begin to shut down in mid to late October.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

After a few years of developing his own animations through free video game development programs, he decided to create his own independent video game studio, which he called Lost Cartridge Creations.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe's the sole video game developer of his company, but says he gets occasional help from his father. \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I want to say around six or seven (years old) is when I really started getting into coding. My dad definitely got me interested but I really wanted to keep learning and working on new projects, so it's really expanded beyond that now,\" Trest told CTVNews.ca in a video interview on Tuesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrest designed and coded the game single-handedly, saying he was inspired by one of his favourite arcade games: Atari's late '70s \"Lunar Lander.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe teenager showcased \"Astrolander\" at a video game expo in Seattle last year, where he gained the attention of head staff at Sony, one of the world's largest video game companies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe then revamped \"Astrolander,\" making it an immersive game where one, or two players act as alien-fighting robots on a mission to save their friends in an outlandish universe.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The new game is more of an action-adventure game where both players will have to control Haptic and their sidekick, Feedback, which are two adventure-seeking cute robots on a mission to save the MVPs, the most valuable programs,\" he said of the premise.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThroughout the game, players can expect to come face-to-face with giant laser-shooting rubber ducks, dive into the depths of the sea and fight off flying dragons.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhat makes the game so special, Trest says, is the immersive features through the video game controller, which allow players to feel the vibrations of the action.

It's really not fair,\" Legault said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe said his party was going to have to \"ask itself the question\" because it was \"really unfair.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe boycott was launched following Meta's decision to block the sharing of Canadian media articles on its platforms.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tQS had to defend itself on Tuesday for having spent on advertising on Meta's platforms, after having suggested in July that it would not encourage Facebook until further notice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to parliamentary leader Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, in the context of the by-election in Jean-Talon, these platforms are essential for contacting voters, and symbolic gestures don't provide a solution.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're going to continue to place ads [on Facebook],\" he said at a press briefing in Quebec City. \"I think all this just goes to show that symbolic gestures won't solve our problem.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis is how he was able to answer \"no\" to the question of whether boycotts are useless, but at the same time assert that they have their \"limits\" and don't provide a solution.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe QS spokesman also refuses to be lectured by Communications Minister Mathieu Lacombe, who on Monday roundly condemned the QS U-turn, as did the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal (CCMM).\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There are interests that are greater than your party interests,\" CCMM president Michel Leblanc said in an interview with Québecor.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I'm telling you that finger-pointing and symbolic demonstrations have a big, big limit and won't solve our problem,\" insisted Nadeau-Dubois.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInstead, QS is calling for \"structuring solutions\" from the Quebec government, such as taxing the web giants.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe PQ, which continues its boycott of Meta, doubts QS' sense of ethics and denounced its lack of solidarity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Our media are dying of a lack of revenue, it's the pillar of democracy, and then you have political parties who, to make a small gain of 1 per cent or 2 per cent in a by-election, are ready to abandon all their principles and then abandon our Quebec media in favour of a multinational,\" condemned PQ leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon in a press scrum.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I'm talking specifically about Québec solidaire, in solidarity with the GAFAM multinationals. It's indefensible in my eyes. We have to stand united and ensure that our Quebec media are viable in the face of these unscrupulous giants.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn fact, the PQ tabled a motion in the National Assembly proposing that elected representatives \"show solidarity with our national and regional media, which have seen their advertising revenues diverted to Meta platforms.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe motion asked parties not to buy ads or sponsor publications on Meta right now, and not to use these platforms this Friday -- a day of boycott organized by the Fédération professionnelle des journalistes du Québec (FPJQ) and the Société québécoise des professionnels en relations publiques.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tQS and the PLQ refused to debate the issue.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Quebec Liberal Party also said it would not end its Facebook advertising campaigns until the supplementary election on Oct. 2.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInterim leader Marc Tanguay pointed out that 88 per cent of Quebecers are on Facebook, and that it's important to be able to connect with these voters.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published in French on Sept. 12, 2023.  \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

So once you go down this road, it is a very slippery slope,\" Bence said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKPMG listed struggles and opposition in rural Ottawa Valley and Winnipeg where some hotel operators saw the tax as harming the tourism industry and an extra tax lever.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Municipalities can pretty much do what they want if they're given that latitude,\" Bence said. \"Who is responsible for paying for (an arena)?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There's lots of ways to build arenas or infrastructure, and it doesn't necessarily have to be specific to one aspect of the tourism industry.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOther options presented by KPMG would also require amendments to provincial legislation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnother option posed by KPMG, is tax-increment funding is a mechanism that divides property tax revenue earned on properties within a defined boundary, seperated into a \"base\" stream and a \"growth\" stream.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor a set period of time, the base stream would be directed to general municipal use while the growth stream would help repay the costs of the redevelopment.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKPMG says this could raise anywhere from $2 million to $9 million per year, but for the city to generate any more than $2 million , it would need to extract revenue from the library portion of the property tax and the provincial education property tax.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn order to do that, The Cities Act and the Education Property Tax Act would need to be amended by the provincial government.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCity administration says it doesn't support KPMG's idea of extending parking hours and increasing rates because it plans on building a parking structure and providing 526 publicly accessible parking stalls on city lands at 22nd Street and Idylwyld Drive. Costs, hours of parking and revenue will be examined later.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAdministration is also advising against KPMG's suggestion of introducing a vehicle rental tax, which would also need provincial legislation. British Columbia is the only Canadian province which has such a tax.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne option the city wouldn't need new or amended laws for is a facility fee. Adding $4.50 on every ticket sold at the arena would generate $2.3 million per year, which could increase to $3.7 million per year if the city were to add $7.50 per ticket. TCU Place and SaskTel Centre currently charge a facility fee.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAdministration will continue to work towards an overall funding plan that will be presented to council in early 2024.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSince discussions for a new arena began in 2018, council and city administration have stated a desire to rely on property tax as little as possible to cover the cost of the project.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

I just see my money is in the hole,” says Joshua Chang.\n \n Four years ago, his family bought a 3-bedroom pre-sale condo in the Atmosphere Development on No. 3 road and Alderbridge. They put down a $250,000 deposit on what was billed as a grand scale neighbourhood. The Atmosphere plan was for seven towers of residential, commercial and retail units.\n \n Then in the spring of 2020, after the developer excavated a massive hole, construction ground to a halt. The developer blames Romspen, the construction lender, for suspending funding, citing COVID-19.\n \n The project is embroiled in lawsuits between the project owner, Alderbridge Way Group and Romspen. Global Education Communities, one of the largest education and student housing investment companies in Canada, which bought two towers in Atmosphere, is also suing Romspen. That trial begins in January 2024.\n \n \nA rendering of the planned Atmosphere development in Richmond. \nThe development is under creditor protection to avoid bankruptcy.\n \n Meanwhile, pre-sale buyers who spoke with CTV News are growing increasingly frustrated and angry.

The developer did not use the money for construction and the deposits remain in trust.\n \n In a statement to CTV News, Alderbridge Way said, “It is disappointing that we reached this point, and we understand and apologize for the frustration this has caused to people who have pre-purchased strata units and invested in Atmosphere.

Because it won’t. We’ve already come across that problem.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCrown prosecutors agree. Dallas Sopko, the president of the Alberta Crown Attorney's Association, says there are still hundreds of important cases in the queue even with the triage system and without expected new cases.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There are over 800 serious and violent cases in Edmonton and Calgary that are over the Jordan threshold, so they are at risk of potentially being stayed,\" he said, adding that more resources would be needed to help the new tough-on-crime initiative succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"If we are no longer triaging files or relying on the triage program, presumably there are going to be more files and more trials,\" Sopko said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We’re going to need more resources to prosecute them, we’re going to need more courtrooms for those matters to be heard in those courtrooms, we’re going to need more judges in those courtrooms, we’re going to need more clerks in those courtrooms, and we’re going to need more sheriffs.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNo new funding was announced with Monday's tough-on-crime initiative, but the province's Crown prosecution services maintains there have been 50 new Crown prosecutor positions added since 2019, and that a pre-charge assessment process continues to be rolled out province-wide to ensure only cases that meet acceptable standards will proceed.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

About 81 per cent of respondents said they didn't feel attached to the monarchy, compared to 14 per cent who said they did, results similar to six months ago.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe latest on The Royal Family\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKing Charles ascended to the throne in September 2022 following the death of Queen Elizabeth at the age of 96 after more than 70 years as the reigning monarch.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCharles celebrated the beginning of his reign with a glitzy coronation in May that was attended by world leaders, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Indigenous leaders and other distinguished guests.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGov. Gen. Mary Simon released a statement on Friday to mark the one-year anniversary of Charles's accession, in which she praised the monarch for his commitment to the environment and to Indigenous reconciliation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We had already seen His Majesty's keen interest in Canada and issues of common concern, such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, and education,\" Simon said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"But in the past year, he has also shown his dedication to public service through his personal commitment to reconciliation, dialogue and rebuilding the Crown-Indigenous relationship.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile the queen's death prompted an outpouring of affection from around the world, the Leger survey results suggest her son has failed to win over the affection of Canadians.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJust over half of respondents, at 51 per cent, agreed with the statement that the monarchy in Canada is outdated, does not have a place in the 21st century, and \"we have to get rid of it.\" In comparison, 33 per cent said the monarchy is an important part of the country's history.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNineteen per cent of respondents said they had lost interest in the monarchy since the queen's death, while most respondents said their interest level had not changed or that they'd had no interest to begin with.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, the number of people who believed the monarchy \"remains a positive symbol for Canada\" rose by four points, to 52 per cent from 48, compared to 2021 data.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe researchers surveyed 1,526 people online between Sept. 8 and 10. While there is no margin of error for online surveys, Leger said a comparable probability sample would yield a margin of error no greater than 2.5 per cent, 19 times out of 20.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAtlantic Canadians reported the highest levels of attachment to the monarchy, at 21 per cent, while Quebecers had the lowest, at eight per cent.

Sources tell CTV News anywhere from a quarter to nearly all the staff in a hospital operating room or care home ward, for example, are there on a short-term contract.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMany of them have left the public system and union pensions to make much higher hourly rates while retaining the ability to choose when and where to work. The agency hires them as temp workers, taking a big slice of the pie for doing so. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor example, a unionized, health authority worker with a designation as a registered nurse in their first 10 years on the job \nmakes roughly $45 as their base hourly wage\n. A recent posting from a \nprominent staffing agency that runs travelnurse.ca \nposted a week-long request for a surgical nurse in the Lower Mainland offering $52.50 per hour, with “bonus incentives” and unspecified benefits.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAll but one of the contracts allows such companies to charge health authorities $75.62 for that same nurse for each hour they work, as well as any travel expenses for those working more than 50 kilometres from where they live. The markup is consistent across professions, and all offer a one per cent credit for each $500,000 spent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe contracts all appeared to have been re-negotiated last year and are nearly identical except for two. ProMed HR Solutions’ contract has redacted the sections outlining its rates, and Ontario-based Calian Ltd’s contract was radically changed last year: until then, they had been charging $115 per hour for registered nurses provided to Interior Health alone.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nA GROWING PROBLEM FOR TIGHT BUDGETS\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBefore the pandemic, so-called “travelling nurses” had been predominantly used in rural and remote communities where they would fill-in at smaller health-care facilities to allow for vacations, medical absences and parental leave. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut the staffing crisis that’s dramatically escalated since the COVID-19 pandemic has \ndramatically increased the reliance\n on short-term contractors, expanding to allied health-care workers like pharmacy technicians and technologists. \n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I would call it a parasitic industry because they are really benefitting from the severe shortages we're seeing in our public health-care system,” said Andrew Longhurst, a health policy researcher at Simon Fraser University. “When you do the math you see about a 30 to 35 per cent markup and that's a pretty significant profit margin – you don't see that in a lot of industries, especially in an industry without a lot of overhead.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe health authorities require the agencies to cover their workers with insurance, but also demand they sign their standard confidentiality agreement, that they cannot assign the agreement to another company, and that “there is no minimum service supply guarantee.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nTRULY A ‘LAST RESORT’?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe health minister and health authority staff have justified the use of agency staff at various times by suggesting they were the workforce that powered vaccinations, testing and contact tracing during the pandemic, that they were a “last resort” that is only called upon to fill vacant shifts when patient safety or keeping a facility open required more staff than were available from the full-time ranks. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut British Columbia \nhas seen a seven-fold increase \nin payouts to those agencies as reliance on them skyrocketed and has continued after public COVID-19 testing collapsed and was abandoned in December of 2021 and many vaccinations are now carried out in pharmacies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“This is privatization of healthcare starting with nursing services and it's not good stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” said BC Nurses’ Union president, Adriane Gear, who pointed to the better working conditions offered by agencies as a major incentive for nurses.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We can see why nurses make this choice, but it's further destabilizing the system and steps need to be taken to keep that from happening,” she said, echoing the concerns of public health-care advocates. “The cost is not sustainable and I think if you could take a fraction of that money and invest it in the health authority nurses in better recruitment and retention strategies, that's where taxpayers' dollars should go.” \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The metric, which is based on new listings, not what existing tenants are paying per month, underscores the ongoing challenges faced by renters in Canada.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRentals.ca's recent report, indicates that while the annual inflation rate for asking rents in August was actually lower than the 12.0 per cent increase recorded in August 2022, this rate still reached a four-month high last month.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the report, from May to August, asking rents have experienced a 5.1 per cent increase, resulting in an average of $103 extra per month.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop real estate headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDespite a surge in rental apartment construction in Canada over the past year, the highest since the 1970s according to Rentals.ca, rent prices have stayed strong, the report shows. Those behind it say this is due to record population growth and declining affordability for homeownership, both of which mean more people are looking for rental units.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen it comes to rental types, studios experienced the most rapid month-over-month rent increase, rising by 2.4 per cent to an average across Canada of $1,480. Meanwhile, one-bedroom units saw the highest year-over-year growth in asking rents, surging by 14.8 per cent to an average of $1,880 per month.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTwo-bedroom asking rents averaged $2,233, marking a 12.3 per cent year-over-year increase, while three-bedroom asking rents averaged $2,448, with a 10.6 per cent year-over-year growth.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAsking rents for purpose-built and condominium apartments averaged a record high of $2,046 in August, increasing 1.9 per cent month-over-month and 12.8 per cent year-over-year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nALBERTA MAINTAINS TOP SPOT FOR RENT GROWTH\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBreaking down the data by region, Alberta maintained its position as the provincial leader in annual rent growth for purpose-built and condominium apartments for the fourth consecutive month, Rentals.ca said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe average asking rent in Alberta rose 15.6 per cent year-over-year, now standing at $1,634. Alberta rent also grew the fastest of all the provinces month-over-month, at 3.5 per cent in August.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe Offer newsletter: Sign up for complete coverage of Canadian real estate news\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFollowing Alberta, Quebec maintained the second-highest annual rent growth in the country, at 14.2 per cent, for the third consecutive month. The average asking rent for purpose-built and condominium apartments in Quebec reached $1,932.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn August, B.C. witnessed a significant annual rent growth of 10.8 per cent, up from its 9.8 per cent pace in July. Average asking rent in B.C. has now reached $2,675, meaning new renters are asked to pay an average of $1,041 more on the West Coast than in Alberta.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe average asking rent in Ontario stood at $2,496 in August, reflecting an annual increase of 9.9 per cent, which was slightly higher than the 9.0 per cent annual growth observed in July.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMeanwhile, Manitoba and Saskatchewan experienced the slowest rent increases over the past year, with annual growth rates of 8.3 per cent and 2.7 per cent, respectively. This led to average rents of $1,457 in Manitoba and $1,102 in Saskatchewan.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nCALGARY LEADS RENT GROWTH IN LARGE CANADIAN CITIES\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAmong Canada's largest cities, Calgary maintained its position as the leader in rent growth, with a year-over-year increase of 17.23 per cent in August. The average rent for purpose-built and condominium apartments in Calgary reached $2,068.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMontreal followed closely with an annual growth rate of 16.4 per cent, and asking rents surpassed the $2,000 mark for the first time, reaching $2,001.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn Canada's priciest cities, Toronto and Vancouver, annual rent increases were below the national average at 8.7 per cent and 7.3 per cent, respectively. This led to average monthly costs of $2,898 in Toronto and $3,316 in Vancouver. Surprisingly, Vancouver experienced a 0.7 per cent decrease in average rents on a monthly basis.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the Rentals.ca report, Canada's largest cities witnessed the strongest month-over-month rent growth in Ottawa, with a 4.5 per cent increase, and Edmonton, with a 4.1 per cent increase.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe average asking rents in these cities were $2,226 in Ottawa and $1,438 in Edmonton, respectively.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen it comes to mid-sized markets, the report shows that some of the country’s most expensive mid-sized markets had among the fastest rising rents during August.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRichmond, B.C., led the way with the highest annual growth in average asking rent, surging 28.1 per cent. This increase brought the average rate to $3,120, making it the third highest among Canada's mid-sized markets.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOakville, Ont., recorded a 23.1 per cent annual rent increase, reaching $3,007, ranking it as the fourth highest in Canada.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMeanwhile, Burnaby, B.C., saw rent increase by an average of 21.1 per cent year-over-year to $3,152, making it the second highest in the country. North Vancouver, B.C., had the highest average asking rent among Canada's mid-sized markets at $3,541, with an annual increase of 17.0 per cent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nSHARED ACCOMMODATION RENT SOARS\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the rentals report, shared accommodations experienced significant rent increases in August. For instance, there was a 24 per cent year-over-year increase in average asking rents for shared units in Quebec, a 20.5 per cent increase in Alberta, a 17.7 per cent increase in B.C., and a 7.5 per cent increase in Ontario.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe highest average asking rent for roommate rentals in Canada was in Vancouver, at $1,773 per month, followed by Toronto with an average of $1,302.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nReporting for this story was paid for through The Afghan Journalists in Residence Project funded by Meta.  \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The answer is no.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe decision underlines provisions of the federal Good Samaritan Act, which protects people from prosecution if they’re charged as a result of seeking help for someone in medical distress, and overturns an eight-year sentence for Paul Eric Wilson.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWilson was with three others driving a truck in Vanscoy on the morning of Sep. 10, 2020 when his friend became unconscious after using fentanyl, Leurer writes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen a Warman RCMP constable arrived on the scene, paramedics were already attending to Delorme.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLeurer says the constable saw a clear bag with what she believed to be meth on the ground near the truck and detained the other three people on scene.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAfter finding a container with syringes and what looked like drugs on Wilson, she placed him under arrest for simple possession.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the course of her further investigation, she searched the truck and several bags. In one backpack, modified handguns and ammunition. In another, scales, baggies and needles they took as evidence of drug trafficking.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWilson was later charged with a number of firearms offences.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“As it turned out, Mr. Wilson was not charged with possession of a controlled substance … despite that being the offence underlying his initial arrest,” said Leurer.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe trial judge rejected Wilson’s claim that his Charter rights had been violated in the arrest and bought the Crown’s argument that the Good Samaritan clause didn’t apply because Wilson was never charged with simple possession of a controlled substance, Leurer says.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut Leurer maintains that since the search that turned up the weapons was the result of an investigation into simple possession, which Wilson could not be charged with under the Good Samaritan Act, the evidence was found unlawfully.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Mr. Wilson could not be charged with that offence at that point as all the evidence supporting such a charge had been 'obtained or discovered as a result of [he and his companions] having sought [medical] assistance' for [his friend] … the interference to Mr. Wilson’s liberty caused by his first arrest was unjustified,” Leurer said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNot only was the search unjustified, but Leurer writes that admitting the evidence would bring the administration of justice “into disrepute.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe officers presented no evidence explaining why they thought they had the power to arrest Wilson for simple possession, even though he couldn’t be charged with the offence, Leurer says.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Police officers who exercise the power of arrest can be expected to act with restraint and such careful assessment as the circumstances allow,” he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHaving detained Wilson for investigative purposes at the scene, Leurer contends they had more than enough time to reflect.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It should have been obvious to the officers that no lawful purpose would be served by Mr. Wilson’s arrest,” he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It is likely that [Wilson's friend] is alive only because one of her companions called 911. In her case, the objective of the Good Samaritan Act was achieved.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDrug users need to trust the Good Samaritan Act will protect them if they call 911 when someone experiences an overdose, Leurer says.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWilson was acquitted on all charges. \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

So to see one being subjected to this sort of vile abuse is appalling.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGreen said the head of bus operations was in direct contact with the operator as soon as he was made aware of the incident to express concern and support. He also said that the safety of employees and customers is the TTC’s top priority at all times and it works closely with union partners to make sure employees are safe while on the job.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe operator has been offered peer and counselling resources, the TTC said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFollowing the incident, Alfred said the operator had to drive her bus “affected and traumatized” out of service to another location to engage a supervisor in-person.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThere should be more resources in place to protect people in situations like this, the union president said. He also stressed that the operator wants to ensure this type of incident never happens to anyone else.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Tuesday evening, policeannouced the arrest of Toronto resident Paul Sampalean. He has been charged with one count each of mischief, intimidation, and causing a disturbance.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSampalean is scheduled to appear in court at the Toronto Regional Bail Centre, 2201 Finch Avenue West, on Wednesday, September 13, 2023, at 10 a.m., in room 105.  \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The boy was a fellow camper, he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTobin went on to say that once the camp learned of the allegations, it “promptly contacted and notified all parents at the Multisport camp that the accused minor may have come into contact with.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Jack of Sports notified parents that there was a police investigation underway and encouraged parents to speak to their children about their camp experience and if their child experienced anything out of the ordinary to contact Jack of Sports immediately,” he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“(We were) advised not to unnecessarily alarm parents whose children were not part of the multisport theme camp and did not come into contact with the accused.

Many of us now have to sit down with our young children tonight and discuss a topic that we shouldn't have to with someone their age. It's stomach-turning.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking with CP24 on Tuesday afternoon, Toronto police Const. Victor Kwong would not get into the specific nature of the allegations but noted that sexual assault is broad in its definition.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Sexual assault, obviously, is not limited to kissing, to touching. It has a very wide range,” he said, adding the other three charges laid pertain to interfering with the “sexual integrity of, in this case, very young six-year-old girls.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“At this time, although we’re not saying what specifically the act was, we’re saying that a six-year-old should not have been subjected or open to this.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKwong went on to say that Toronto police learned of the incidents from the girls’ parents, but took ample time to investigate the allegations, especially since they involved “very young children,” before laying any charges.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We’re not going to rush something like this,” he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe urged any parents or guardians of children who attended the camp during that specific week at that specific location and who noticed any changes in their child’s “demeanour or emotions” to contact Toronto police, who will further explore what may have happened with any possible victims.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We don’t want parents to talk to their children directly about the specific incident because we want specific witness statements or anything coming forward to be as genuine as possible,” Kwong said, adding investigators at Boost have specific training on how to speak with and interview children about sensitive topics, like sexual assault.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSIGNS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKayla Yama, the director of clinical services at Boost Child & Youth Advocacy Centre, told CP24 that young victims of such a crime may experience atypical anxiety as well as challenges with regulation like tantrums, meltdowns or difficulty with behaviours that most six-year-old children would have “mastered.” Some examples she pointed to include difficulty sleeping, bed wetting, fears around separation, and a “demonstration of sexual knowledge or curiosity.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I think it's really important when we're talking about something as serious as sexual abuse, I also say that all some of these signs in isolation, it doesn't mean that a child has been sexually abused,” said Yama, who urged parents of children who went to that camp during that week to check in with their kids, to ask them broad questions about their experience. She also encouraged parents to have conversation with their kids about consent and establish a “foundation of safety” within their home so that they feel comfortable coming to them to talk about anything without the fear of getting in trouble.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tToronto police are concerned there may be more victims and are asking anyone with information to reach out to them at 416-808-2922 or Crime Stoppers anonymously.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWith files from CTV News Toronto’s Kathering DeClerq and Beth MacDonnell.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The radiation produced by cellphones cannot directly damage DNA and is different from stronger types of radiation like X-rays or ultraviolet light.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn 2018, two U.S. government studies that bombarded mice and rats with cellphone radiation found a weak link to some heart tumours, but federal regulators and scientists said it was still safe to use the devices. Scientists said those findings didn't reflect how most people use their cellphones and that the animal findings didn't translate into a similar concern for humans.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAmong the largest studies on potential dangers of cellphone use, a 2010 analysis in 13 countries found little or no risk of brain tumours.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPeople's mobile phone habits also have changed substantially since the first studies began and it's unclear if the results of previous research would still apply today.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSince many tumours take years to develop, experts say it's difficult to conclude that cellphones have no long-term health risks. Experts have recommended that people concerned about their cellphone radiation exposure use earphones or switch to texting.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

But then the weather pattern flips over later in the season.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tScott said the forecast isn't the best for ski hills in British Columbia because the El Nino jet steam will persist from fall into winter \"and that doesn't give the best pattern for getting a lot of snow in the mountains.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe fall forecast also doesn't help the wildfire season on the West Coast at the start of the fall because the atmosphere is expected to be drier than normal and significant rain isn't expected until the middle of the season, Scott said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Weather Network is also predicting that a few snowstorms will rage across the Prairie provinces in the middle of fall, cutting short the region's harvest season.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"However, as we flip towards the latter half of November into December, when we typically can get some of our coldest weather of the entire year ... it looks like the season should balance out to be slightly above normal in the Prairies,\" Scott said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSimilarly, Ontario and Quebec are expected to see a nasty push of cold air in October but winter is forecast to begin on a mild note, he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We think the fall colours should be quite vibrant but things turn a little bit rotten and cold in the middle of October and will short circuit some of the really nice leaf-seeing time of the fall season,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOntario and Quebec are also expected to see less precipitation than normal, Scott added, and there may be some wind storms during the fall that cause power outages.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn Atlantic Canada, although early indicators show precipitation will likely be typical for the fall season, unpredictable storms that approach from the tropics could be a threat, The Weather Network said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're really watching how tropical storms or hurricanes may come up the eastern seaboard and give a period of heavier rain for the Atlantic provinces,\" Scott said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTemperatures are also expected to be typical in the Atlantic provinces, except Nova Scotia, which might see a hotter-than-normal fall, The Weather Network predicted.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn western Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Yukon, The Weather Network is predicting above-normal temperatures.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tScott said precipitation should be above normal in the North as well, especially across western and central Nunavut and some parts of the Northwest Territories.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's all because of El Nino directing the weather patterns across the world,\" Scott said of Canada's fall forecast.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The narrative of this fall is that we'll see this cold push in the middle of the season and then moderating towards the end.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 13, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He was found to have not violated the code on many other allegations.\n \n The two votes in favour of accepting the report were Morgaine Halpin and David Baughman.\n \n “The events of last night with the integrity commissioner’s report caught me totally off guard,” said Baughman.\n \n Tuesday, CTV News attempted to speak to the four councillors who voted to reject the report.\n \n Deputy Mayor Todd Noble hung up the phone when CTV News called.\n \n \nAn undated image of Central Elgin Integrity Commissioner Laura Dean. (Source: Aird & Berlis LLP) \n \n Graham and Connors issued a joint written statement, and Watson was the only one to answer questions about his voting decision.\n \n “I wanted to show that I support my mayor,” said Watson. “He’s done a lot of great things in getting a zero per cent tax increase and his dealings with Volkswagen that sounds very positive going forward. I think this integrity commissioner trying to nitpick on some procedural technicalities and that’s not fair to him.”\n \n The joint statement from Graham and Connors called out the IC for not contacting all identified witnesses and called that a “significant oversight.”\n \n “The council of MCE made unanimous decisions regarding the national anthem, the hiring of the consultant, and the NDA,” their statement said.\n \n It continued, “The Mayor individually discussed the NDA with each councillor, followed by unanimous approval, and this should not be disregarded. This was a collective decision by council on a time sensitive matter. The hiring of the consultant was approved by all of council as was the institution of the national anthem. The CAO initially stated, while in the company of other councillors, that the mayor had only to ask him for the national anthem to be played. When the CAO later changed his opinion on the procedure, the mayor brought the matter to council and it was approved.”\n \n \nCentral Elgin Councillor Norman Watson seen on Sept 12, 2023. (Brent Lale/CTV News London)\n \n Dean told CTV News Tuesday the report speaks for itself, and she was surprised council decided to not even deal with the report, which found contraventions on the part of the mayor.\n \n “There is a statutory framework that's set out in the municipal act and accountability framework, and that's to provide accountability and transparency,” said Dean. “When we see councils making decisions, such as the one they made last night to ignore the reports of an independent statutory officer, it does raise some concern that there is not proper respect for this framework.”\n \n \nMayor Sloan was found to have violated the code\n when he directed staff to make decisions with the proper authority, and when he executed a non-disclosure agreement without authorization from council.\n \n “This is the kind of strong-mayor system that is being implemented in now 49 municipalities across the province,” said Joseph Lyons, a political science professor at Western University. “This is the kind of thing that is going to be happening more where you have the mayor directing staff, and that’s the kind of dynamic some observers are worried about.”\n \n CTV spoke to Central Elgin Chief Administrative Officer Robin Greenall to ask if she could reveal the cost of the IC report. CTV News was told it would not be released at this time, but it could be upwards of $80 thousand when completed.\n \n “I pay a lot of taxes and I'd like to see the money get used better than thrown down the drain and ignored,” said Robert Allen, a Central Elgin resident.\n \n “Transparency and accountability, that's what I voted my councillor for and I don't see that happening,” said resident Leigh Mauer.\n \n Another resident in Belmont told CTV News off camera that the optics look bad, even referencing the infamous (Joe) Fontana 8 in London. They said while watching the meetings, there appears to be a voting block that can do what they want with no repercussions.\n \n So what does that mean going forward?\n \n \"I'd hate to say it’s carte blanche because that paints a really bad picture for Central Elgin,’ said Baughman. “But I would say that we do have rules to abide and I don't think the respect that is due was given here.\"\n \n Meanwhile, Watson would like to see council become more of a cohesive unit, “If we can get this nitpicking to stop we can move forward, and we can save a lot more money because we will not have to pay an integrity commissioner and if we work together we’ll get a lot more done.”\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He didn’t buy the home on Dufferin Avenue East until 1916. By then he was already twice elected to the House of Commons. He moved in with his wife and three chidren.\n \n “He owned that property until 1928,” Kostuchuk said.\n \n “From the work that our committee did, there's no record of him owning any other home in Portage after that date. So to the best of our knowledge, that was his home until the family officially left Portage la Prairie.”\n \n \nArthur Meighen served as prime minister on two separate occasions, from 1920 to 1921 and in 1926 from June to September. (Source: Archives of Manitoba)\n \n Meighen served as Canada’s prime minister on two separate occasions - from 1920 to 1921 and in 1926 from June to September, though neither were through elections.\n \n The home he left behind on his way to Ottawa had various tenants throughout the decades until it was purchased by Eric Vieweg in 1993. By then, it was subdivided into apartments and in need of some serious TLC.\n \n “It was pretty brutal,” Vieweg said in a phone interview with CTV News Winnipeg, recalling the original hardwood floors that were sanded and drilled into oblivion and walls without any insulation.\n \n “I picked it up. I got a reasonable price on it and kind of reluctantly because I knew it was going to be a lot of work.”\n \n It was work that Vieweg, a former cabinet maker and carpenter, was well suited for.\n \n It took him nearly 30 years to restore the home to its former glory, but restore it he did, upgrading the plumbing and wiring, adding new hardwood floors and a wraparound porch. The goal, all the while, was to maintain its historical charm with a modern touch.\n \n \n(Source: Graham McCallum)\n \n To Kostuchuk, the heritage home’s incredibly handy new owner was a dream come true.\n \n “He was the unicorn purchaser because from a heritage standpoint, he is a person who took a home that needed a lot of work and then proceeded to spend the next 20, 25 years making that home kind of back up to the grandeur that it had when Meighen lived there.”\n \n Grand as it may be, Vieweg has been trying to sell the home for some time, first listing it last year. But after a few promising nibbles, he wasn’t able to reel in a buyer amid uncertain interest rates.\n \n He took it off the market last winter, but has now relisted it. Realtor Meagan McKillop is optimistic they’ll find the right buyer this time around.\n \n \"We are going into fall market which is typically a busier time for buying and selling. With the recent hold of the interest rates, I’m hopeful we’ll find the right buyer.\"\n \n \n(Source: Graham McCallum)\n \n Kostuchuk, who has watched in appreciation over the years as the home was lovingly restored, hopes its next chapter will be authored by someone who will enjoy it and its historical significance.\n \n “It has the original bath tub, and that's the tub where Meighen would have been making decisions about the Winnipeg General Strike. And then the banisters, the rooms that his children would have run through.”\n \n Vieweg, who now lives in Winnipeg, is also eager to see the home he worked on for so many years enjoyed for many more to come.\n \n “It’s a nice family house. It’s got lots of room and if you like a little bit of history, it’s great.”\n \n \n- With files from CTV's Devon McKendrick\n \n \n(Source: Graham McCallum)\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

His 19-year-old son Kristian was charged with distribution, possession and accessing child pornography.\n \n In October of 2021, Woodstock police said they received a cyber tip from the RCMP’s National Child Exploitation Crime Centre (NCECC). They had received notification from the social network platform Snapchat that a video — which met the Criminal Code definition of child pornography — had been uploaded to their platform, and that the IP address associated with the upload originated from within the City of Woodstock.\n \n Woodstock police began investigating and obtained a search warrant in January of 2022. As a result, Mario said several devices were seized from the his family home, including an old iPhone that had not been in use for months because it belonged to his son Kristian and it had been hacked.\n \n Woodstock police conducted a digital forensic examination on this phone and said “it contained materials that met the Criminal Code definition of child pornography.”\n \n This gave them \"reasonable and probable grounds\" to proceed to lay the charges against Kristian.\n \n \"When I found out about this, I was shocked, because the cops were saying, ‘Images, child pornography.’ I’ve never seen any of this stuff, I’ve never seen it on my phone,” said Kristian.\n \n Mario said police could have done more before laying the charges against his son.\n \n “They didn't ask enough questions, they started that investigation from a position of guilt, they never took any innocence into consideration,” he said.\n \n Toronto criminal defence lawyer, Michelle Biddulph, who represented Kristian, said people have to be really careful if they get any notification that their social media credentials are compromised.\n \n “If someone gets access to them, and uses them to share child pornography, it's you that will be subject to the charges, not them, because of course, how are the police going to know whether its you that’s sharing the material or someone else. They are going to lay the charge and let the court system figure it out,” explained Biddulph.\n \n So the family decided to take matters into their own hands and hired their own digital forensic analyst.\n \n \nMario and Kristian Spina of Woodstock, Ont. (Reta Ismail/CTV News London)\n \n “I was able to pull up records demonstrating that both Kristian’s account and a number of his family members’ who all share the same home IP address had all been compromised. This is something that had the police taken into consideration from the onset, they would have approached this a little differently,” said Jason Conley, a digital forensic analyst with Envista Forensics.\n \n Conley said thumbnails from a single video were stored deep within the snapchat application — an indication that the video had never been viewed.\n \n \"If someone were to log into your say Snapchat account on a different phone, and share child pornography, remnants of that might show up on your phone. Just through a concept called remote synchronization,” said Biddulph.\n \n The issue with Kristian’s case was the evidence of the credentials being compromised wasn't found by police on Kristian’s phone; they got that later from the defence, after the charge was laid.\n \n A year after Kristian was charged, Biddulph said the Crown’s attorney withdrew the charges after the judge restricted what the Crown’s digital forensic expert could testify about.\n \n According to court documents, the judge said he was not satisfied that the expert was qualified to properly analyze and interpret the data extracted from Kristian’s phone.\n \n Mario filed a complaint of misconduct against the Woodstock Police Service through the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD).\n \n \"They didn't accept any of the shortcomings, even though we kept talking about that they should have done more, they didn’t,\" said Mario.\n \n They received a decision back, stating that the Woodstock Deputy Chief of Police Nick Novacich reviewed the documents and determined \"the Woodstock police did complete an adequate and thorough investigation into this matter. He continued to say that he did not find any reference that the investigation was ‘improper or neglectful.’”\n \n CTV News London reached out to Novacich and asked if the process by which these charges are laid has changed since this case, or if there has been additional training for officers who work on such cases. He declined an on camera interview, but provided a statement, which reads in part:\n \n \"The Woodstock police continually enhance and develop our members’ skills and qualifications to keep up with the rapid changing technology involved in such complex investigations.\"\n \n The family is exploring all options — but have not taken any legal action.\n \n “Having your name published online for something you didn't do, especially as bad a case as this, you know, it feels like you can't live your life the same,\" said Kristian. \n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

That’s also a part of being optimistic.”\n \n On Tuesday, the three-day National Liberal Caucus began at the RBC Place Convention Centre.\n \n Liberal MPs, cabinet, and the prime minister will discuss several challenges facing the country including housing and homelessness.\n \n “It’s up to every MP, and I include myself in this, to put ideas on the table directly to the government, to the prime minister, to get us out of this,” explains Fragiskatos.\n \n Currently, an estimated 2,000 individuals are experiencing homelessness, including 600 high-needs individuals living in tents and makeshift shelters.\n \n Just a few blocks from the caucus meetings, a lineup of hungry and unhoused Londoners kept members of London City Street Outreach busy handing out sandwiches, spaghetti, and dry clothing.\n \n \nMeals served by London City Street Outreach in a parking lot in the Old East Village in London, Ont. on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023 (Daryl Newcombe/CTV News London)\n \n “I’d like them to stop playing politics, and I would like them to start looking at people’s hearts,” says Carol Butts, treasurer of the faith-based group.\n \n London City Street Outreach feeds about 400 people each week at four different locations.\n \n “Start providing the actual things they need.

The suspects were arrested in connection to the death of James Vernon Giesbrecht.\n \n The victim’s remains were found in the trunk of a burned-out Honda Accord in the RM of Cornwallis on Oct. 13, 2022. RCMP, a forensic anthropologist, and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner worked to identify the remains and the cause of death.\n \n The death was ruled a homicide and the remains were identified in January 2023 – the month after Giesbrecht was reported missing.\n \n “James Vernon Giesbrecht was only 37 when he died,” said Supt. Rob Lasson with the RCMP Major Crime Services.\n \n “He lived in Brandon his whole life. He was a proud father, brother, son, who worked hard to support and spend time with his loved ones in Brandon.”\n \n During the investigation, Mounties determined the Accord was stolen out of Regina. Police were able to identify the person who stole the car; however, they were not involved in the homicide. Investigators then learned one of the suspects gained possession of the stolen car.\n \n With this information, RCMP put out pleas to the public for help and gained valuable information.

These two men were charged with first-degree murder.\n \n Christopher Cutlip, 40, was arrested at the Brandon Correctional Centre and charged with second-degree murder.\n \n “To lay a first-degree murder charge, there’s a high threshold that needs to be met,” said Lasson said at a news conference on Tuesday.\n \n “In the investigation we are discussing today, investigators worked a complex set of circumstances to meet the evidentiary threshold to secure these very serious charges.”\n \n Lasson described the homicide as “calculated and planned.”\n \n He said Giesbrecht and the suspects were known to each other and that the victim was “lured” to his death.\n \n No other suspects are being sought out in connection with this homicide.\n \n None of the charges have been proven in court.

We think not only do we have to address this lack of appropriate housing, but we need to make sure that women and children are housed in emergency situations when they're subjected to domestic violence.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe also would like for there to be more housing, not just in large urban areas, but throughout the province.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor Shone and the PCs, one of the steps is making sure the housing that is available now is up to par for people, saying money needs to be spent on refurbishing, maintaining and rebuilding properties.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We have a homeless strategy right now, it is $126 million to shift efforts from managing (homelessness) to ending (homelessness), truly ending homelessness. It was launched earlier than planned because of the urgency of homelessness,\" said Shone.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLamont said his party would overhaul the rental tenancies branch so that it wasn't just a rubber stamp to evicting people and there could be an appeal process for tenants when there is a large jump in rent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We've also committed to the same date housing strategy. We can't do it overnight, but that's what we need to aim for. Currently, in Manitoba, when you're homeless, you have to be chronically homeless for six months to be able to have to be housed. That can be a very, very cold six months,\" said Lamont.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe candidates were also asked if their parties would commit to raising the basic needs budget of Employment and Income Assistance (EIA).\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen asked in a, 'yes' or 'no' format, both Fontaine and Shone held up no to the question.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're committed to supporting folks that are on EIA. What does that look like right now? Right now, our commitments are universal meal programs for children, its supporting individuals with mental health and addiction services. It's supporting folks to access more affordable social housing. The reality is that we're not going to be able to have a full understanding of what's going on and what the PCs have done in the last seven years,\" said Fontaine\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShone said EIA is something that needs to evolve.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We need to evolve by using tools to assess how everybody gets their income. So these types of tools would us to individualize support plans tailored to each person's complex needs,\" said Shone.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLamont said EIA needs to change as people on the bottom end of the scale are only getting pennies and supports haven't changed in 35 years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's really about making sure the people at the top pay more and making sure the people who really need it, get what they need. That's the opposite of what has been happening for the past seven years,\" said Lamont.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGibson agreed that a basic income guarantee is important, but noted additional support would be needed to help people take the next steps.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We need to have sufficient free mental health services and addiction support services to complement this. The healing from the stress that has been caused by intergenerational neglect and the long time that we have not had sufficient social housing,\" said Gibson.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEarlier Tuesday, the leaders of the NDP, Liberals and PCs were at a debate talking about their ideas on the economy and safety, which was hosted by the Manitoba Heavy Construction Association.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

A bottle of Narcan was found next to her in her purse.\n \n Seven months later, Valerie received another call from police. Her daughter Nicole Lafontaine, 31, had fallen out of a fifth floor window at the YWCA. She died from her injuries in hospital a short time later.\n \n “I didn’t even get to say goodbye to my girls,” Valerie said. “I got a lot of life to live myself and now I have two less children.”\n \n \nAndrea Lafontaine (left) and her sister Nicole (right) died seven months apart. (Photo courtesy of Valerie Lafontaine) \n \n Regina police confirmed officers responded to a report of an injured person at the YWCA on July 22 at 2:45 a.m. Based on the investigation conducted by police and the Saskatchewan Coroners Service (SCS), Nicole’s injuries and cause of death were deemed not criminal in nature.\n \n Valerie believes Nicole was suffering from a drug-induced psychosis at the time of her death as a result of withdrawing from fentanyl.\n \n YWCA logs show that staff members were aware of changes to Nicole’s behaviour in the days leading up to her death and her struggles with withdrawal. Extra room checks were encouraged for her and staff tried to connect her with a harm reduction clinic.\n \n “They were both seeking help. They both had active addictions and they should have been checked on,” Valerie said, adding both her daughters were fleeing abusive relationships.\n \n “As far as I’m concerned, the YWCA failed my daughters.”\n \n YWCA Regina cannot comment on specific cases, but CEO Melissa Coomber-Bendtsen said the situations surrounding every death in the building undergo an internal review.\n \n Coomber-Bendtsen said each of the YWCA’s clients have a specific case management plan in place, which includes a safety plan for those with active addictions. The plans determine how often people are checked in on, whether that be hourly, nightly or somewhere in between, and what supports are provided.\n \n “Case management plans would include housing, budgeting and now all of our case management plans also include safety planning around drug use, so ensuring people aren’t using by themselves and ensuring people that do use also have the ability to be trained in naloxone,” Coomber-Bendtsen said.\n \n Since 2022, eight women staying at YWCA Regina have died from drug poisonings or overdoses, according to Coomber-Bendtsen. She said the number of drug-related deaths is much higher when including all women who are connected to the YWCA’s outreach team.\n \n As of May 2023, YWCA staff responded to more than 75 overdoses in the building and surrounding area.\n \n “In the last couple years, the drugs that we’re seeing and how quickly someone could be poisoned by them, as opposed to the idea of overdoses, has drastically changed the amount of deaths that we’ve seen,” Coomber-Bendtsen said, adding clients cannot use drugs inside the building, but are allowed to use outdoors without losing access to YWCA services and shelter.\n \n  \n \nGet the CTV News app for Saskatchewan breaking news alerts and top stories \n \n \n In response to the growing addictions crisis, Coomber-Bendsten said the YWCA has invested in a harm reduction team and training for staff and volunteers, which includes training on naloxone and safety planning for drug users.\n \n “It has become part of what all of our staff get when they first start working here,” Coomber-Bendtsen said.\n \n There have been 108 confirmed drug toxicity deaths in the province this year, according to data from the SCS last updated Sept. 6. Another 225 suspected overdose deaths have been recorded.\n \n Final autopsy reports, on average, take between four and six months to receive, according to the SCS. Reports can take longer depending on the type of examinations conducted. However, the SCS said it is not currently experiencing any significant delays.\n \n The SCS could not specifically comment on the reasons why Valerie has not received the final report for Andrea’s death.\n \n 'SERIOUS ACTION' NEEDED\n \n Taneisha Roussin knows what it feels like to lose a loved one to drugs.\n \n Her sister Myia Tovee, 20, died from an overdose while living at the Regina YWCA in October 2022.\n \n YWCA staff found her dead on the floor of her room.\n \n “I believe my sister was sitting there for minimum six hours by herself before somebody came in and actually checked on her,” Roussin said.\n \n Tovee was found with carfentanyl and acetyl fentanyl in her system, according to Roussin. Prior to her death, Tovee had been sober for nine months.\n \n “It just took the one time of her relapsing,” said Roussin, adding she believes her sister’s death could have been prevented.\n \n \nMyia Tovee (left) and her sister Taneisha Roussin (right). (Photo courtesy of Taneisha Roussin) \n \n “I think that if she were with somebody, she wouldn’t have had the temptation to relapse.”\n \n “I know she was smart because when she would use by herself in the past, she’d always have Narcan with her. I just I can’t see her doing that to herself if she was surrounded by people.”\n \n After reviewing her sister’s text messages following her death, Roussin believes another woman staying at the YWCA is the one who supplied Tovee with drugs, which she said is “alarming.”\n \n Roussin understands enhanced security and safety measures come with money, but she would like to see the YWCA increase its surveillance and wellness checks on residents.\n \n “To me, it’s just like, how many overdoses are you going to allow happen here before you start taking serious action about it?” Roussin questioned.\n \n Valerie echoed Roussin’s calls to action. On top of increased security and safety measures, she believes staff should be better trained to identify warning signs related to drug-induced psychosis.\n \n “I want some accountability. I don’t want any other parents to have to go through this anymore,” Valerie said.\n \n In the YWCA’s experience, adding more surveillance cameras and increased “policing” in the building does not necessarily result in fewer drug poisonings, Coomber-Bendtsen said.\n \n “Anytime we have policed the issue more, we have not seen a reduction in the amount of people that are dying by overdose or by drug poisoning,” she said.\n \n “It’s really about a healing journey and providing space for that healing and opportunity for support services for that healing.”\n \n Those support services include access to detox centres and a safe space for people to move through their drug addiction, Coomber-Bendtsen said, adding that wrap-around services will yield better results than increasing security cameras.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

She said children six months to four years old who have received a previous dose of a vaccine should receive a single dose of the updated vaccine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said each province and territory will provide additional information about regional COVID-19 and flu vaccine availability, but that \"we will have enough supply of the updated COVID-19 vaccines to support immunization programs across Canada.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHealth Canada is also reviewing a submission by Pfizer-BioNTech to have its Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine approved for use in people six months and older, as well as a submission by Novavax for its Omicron XBB.1.5 vaccine for people 12 years and older.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAUTUMN OUTLOOK\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast fall, Canada experienced an early start to the influenza season as well as high numbers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections.

Dickson alleged in \na formal complaint\n that Kaplan-Myrth became \"extremely insensitive, insulting and disrespectful\" and that comments Kaplan-Myrth made about other trustees were \"defamatory and disrespectful\" during conversations last fall over whether Dickson would support Kaplan-Myrth's motion to reinstate a mask mandate at OCDSB schools. \n \n  \n \nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n \n \n It follows several disruptions and protests of OCDSB meetings in recent months over issues including masks and transgender policy.\n \n In a statement to CTV News Ottawa, Education Minister Stephen Lecce urged the board to focus on the 'Three Rs'.\n \n \"We share the concerns of many parents troubled by the behaviour at, and leading up to, last night’s board meeting. Our government urges the board to focus on the academic achievement of students and get back to basics of what matters most: reading, writing and math,\" Lecce said. \"In one of Ontario's largest school boards, time and resources should be focused on student achievement and wellbeing, not on debates stemming from actions that undermine public confidence.\"\n \n The vote on whether to declare that Kaplan-Myrth breached the code of conduct failed by a slim margin, with seven trustees voting in favour and four choosing to abstain. The motion needed eight supporters to pass. Kaplan-Myrth did not vote, per board rules.\n \n \nTrustees at odds\n \n The school board said that efforts to mediate the matter between Dickson and Kaplan-Myrth were unsuccessful and a formal review policy was initiated. An independent third party investigator was retained to review the facts and prepare a report. That led the vote on whether a code of conduct breach occurred, which ultimately failed.\n \n After the meeting, Dickson called Kaplan-Myrth a bully.\n \n \"What message are we sending to our students? It's okay to bully and call it something else?\" she told reporters.\n \n Kaplan-Myrth claimed the attempted to censure her was a political attack.\n \n \"This has been a character assassination from the beginning,\" she said Monday night. \"This has been part of an organized attack on me right from the very beginning of my tenure here. There have been people who have gone out of their way to try to attack me.\"\n \n Kaplan-Myrth has been the target of frequent violent and antisemitic attacks dating back to before she ran for trustee, many of which she highlights on social media. \n \n  \n \nRELATED: Ottawa police issue warrant for Windsor man following antisemitic threats against local doctor\n \n \n Dickson said in her complaint that she recognized Kaplan-Myrth feels embattled, but said she should have recognized that her comments were hurtful.

She filed a formal complaint in February after Evans said Kaplan-Myrth did not believe an apology was warranted.\n \n According to a third-party report by Michael Maynard, an investigator with ADR Chambers, Kaplan-Myrth sent Dickson a message on Nov. 12, 2022, seeking support for her motion to mandate masks. Dickson initially said she would support Kaplan-Myrth's motion, but a week later, on Nov. 19, Dickson replied to Kaplan-Myrth to say she changed her mind and would not support a mandate.\n \n \"My final decision was influenced by the wishes of my constituents. They have overwhelming (\nsic\n) indicated that they do not want a mask mandate. As their representative, I feel that I must respect their wishes,\" Dickson wrote.\n \n Kaplan-Myrth replied to say that Dickson was hearing only from \"angry people\" and not the people in support of her motion.\n \n \"The anti-mask crowd has mobilized to send out letters. Many of those people aren't even Ottawa families. This disproportionately affects the very people whose families are poor, who cannot miss work or school, who are most likely to end up in hospital. I beg you to reconsider,\" Kaplan-Myrth's text said.\n \n  \n \nRELATED: Hate mail may persuade new trustees to vote against mask mandate, trustee fears\n \n \n Kaplan-Myrth then named three trustees, Lynn Scott, Donna Blackburn, and Matthew Lee, whom she accused of not caring if children get sick.

The next day, Kaplan-Myrth texted Dickson to say the organizers of the protest were white supremacists and claimed one woman, whose name was anonymized in the report for privacy, was a cofounder of a \"transphobic anti-vaxxer racist organization.\"\n \n \"The people who organized letter writing campaigns do not care about poor families or anyone else that gets sick. I am very sad that you said a week ago that you would support a mandate and now you do not,\" she said.\n \n During the reconvened special meeting on Nov. 24, Kaplan-Myrth texted Dickson again while the meeting was taking place, telling her to abstain from the vote.\n \n \"Don't vote with white supremacists,\" she said.\n \n Dickson replied, \"Leave me alone.\" To which Kaplan-Myrth replied, \"Don't talk to me about equity then.\"\n \n \nA text message exchange between OCDSB trustee Nili Kaplan-Myrth (left side) and OCDSB trustee Donna Dickson (right side) sent during a board meeting Nov. 24, 2022.

That is what I was saying and I stand by it.\"\n \n \nTrustees question how to move on\n \n Dickson told reporters Monday night that there are several important decisions facing the board, but she's not sure how to move forward.\n \n \"How are we going to be fair and just to our students if we can't make a fair and just decision?\" she asked. \"I'm here for the betterment of all students… how do we do that when you have 12 people that can't get on the same page?

Between 2019 and 2023, the city has received 285 service requests for clothing donation boxes, with the majority focusing on property standards and the \"over-accumulation of donated items,\" staff say.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tStaff are recommending the city implement a new Clothing Donation Box Bylaw with a mandatory permit system for clothing donation box owners, to \"address the ongoing issues with clothing donation boxes.\" The report says the permit system would increase accountability for clothing donation box owners to \"empty and maintain their boxes\" and provide transparency regarding \"who owns and operates clothing donation boxes\" in Ottawa.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tClothing donation box owners would be required to provide the city with specific information and documentation to obtain a permit, including where each clothing donation box is located, proof of valid insurance, confirmation of safety certification of each box, and written consent from each private property owner allowing the box.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUnder the bylaw, the clothing donation boxes must display the name, telephone number and email address of the box owner and the valid charity registration number or not-for-profit corporation number.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tStaff are also recommending a validation sticker issued by the city be placed on each approved clothing donation box, and all information must be displayed in both English and French.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe city anticipates six to nine permit holders will operate donation bins in the city of Ottawa, with 250 to 400 total clothing donation boxes set up on public and private property. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf approved, the new bylaw and permit system would be implemented on Jan. 31, 2024. Clothing donation bins from registered charities only would only be permitted at city facilities\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRevenue from the permit fees would fund the administration, management and enforcement of the new regulatory system by staff.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tStaff note Belleville, Cornwall and Gatineau require clothing donation box operators to obtain a general permit or licence from the city, while Toronto, Mississauga and London have clothing donation box regulations in the business licensing bylaws.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSecond-hand clothing and thrift stores who operate clothing donation boxes on the same property of their stores, include Value Village and the Salvation Army Thrift Stores, would not need a permit for the donation box on the property. Staff say the organizations would still be responsible for ensuring their boxes comply with regulations for box location, maintenance and information displayed on the box. Indoor donation boxes will not be included in the bylaw since they are still subject to existing property standards regulations, according to staff.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The jury heard the cab driver testify that the black pickup truck driver said to him, “Call the cops” followed by “I just hit someone. I just killed someone.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen a 9-1-1 dispatcher asked for his name, the truck driver responded “Nate Veltman.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the call with the dispatcher, Veltman said “It was me, it was me that did it. Come arrest me,” and when asked if he was injured replied, “No, I did on purpose.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMinutes later, London police arrived on scene, Veltman exited the truck, put his hands on his head and got to his knees to be arrested by two officers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t \n\r\n\n\r\n\tTHE CROWN BEGINS DELIVERING ITS CASE\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nOpening statements were made\n at the Windsor Superior Courthouse on Monday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFederal prosecutor Sarah Shaikh presented the jury with the evidence the Crown intends to call, in which Veltman intentionally drove his pickup truck into the Afzaal family “because they were Muslims.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I thought I needed to send a strong message,” Veltman allegedly told police, who said his actions were motivated by the damage he believed was being caused by “mass immigration.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I was planning on killing,” Veltman told police, according to Shaikh. “I knew what I did. I don’t regret what I did. I admit that it was terrorism.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFollowing the Crown presenting its opening statements, the first witness to be called at the trial by Shaikh was an Afzaal family member who told the jury his family was “peace loving.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLater, a forensic identification specialist with the London Police Service testified about surveillance videos he seized and edited as part of the investigation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t \n\r\n\n\r\n\tWHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE TRIAL?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe trial got underway on Sept. 5 in which members of the jury were selected over a two-day process. In all, 14 jurors, consisting of eight men and two women, and two alternates were selected.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast year, Justice Renee Pomerance \nmoved the trial from London to Windsor\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Sept. 8, it was determined that after some “intense negotiations,” the number of witnesses expected to by the Crown ended up being cut down.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt’s estimated that \nthe trial will now take approximately eight weeks\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t \n\r\n\n\r\n\tTHE JUNE 6, 2021 ATTACK\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn June 6, 2021 five members of the Afzaal family were out for a summer walk along Hyde Park Road in west London when they were run down by a pickup truck in what police allege was a hate motivated attack.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFour people died, including father Salman, mother Madiha, 15-year-old daughter Yumna, and grandmother Talat.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe lone survivor was a nine-year-old boy who was injured, and has since recovered. He is now living with relatives.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMoments after the crash, London police arrested and charged Nathaniel Veltman, now 22 years of age.

These events upended your educations, your first jobs, your early years of building a career and a network,\" said the prime minister in Charlottetown on Wednesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAfter highlighting what the government has done to try to address these strains so far, from offering ways to save up to buy a home to eliminating interest on student loans, Trudeau noted \"there's lots more to do.\"   \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nCapital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We owe it to you to take action, so you can fully benefit from the promise of Canada. So you can succeed and access all the opportunities the generations before you had. So that you can have both a healthy economy and a healthy environment in strong, vibrant communities long into the future. As a team, this is one of our top priorities,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrudeau's millennial reach-out comes after cabinet was to hear directly during the retreat from Paul Kershaw, the founder of \nGeneration Squeeze a think-tank\n focused on advocating for young Canadians struggling to get ahead in the current economic climate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis renewed messaging targeted at younger voters also follows \nrecent polling by Abacus Data\n, which found the Liberals were trailing the Conservatives by 11 points among millennials (those born between 1980 and 1996), and among Gen Z voters (those born between 1997 and 2005) Trudeau's party is four points behind Poilievre's Conservative Party.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking to CTV News at the cabinet retreat, Kershaw said Poilievre should be credited for \"tapping into\" the grief many young people are feeling, but cautioned that if his \"doom and gloom momentum\" gives rise to a disillusionment it could have a counterintuitive effect given millennials'' lasting electoral sway.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"If it gives rise to more cynicism, and has younger people opt out, and we need them to opt in with their parents and grandparents to change the system… so that we can make our policies ready for the moment… cynicism won't get us there,\" Kershaw said. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tA new analysis by RBC released Wednesday warns that millennials \nare \"more indebted than ever.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Canadians between the ages of 35 and 44 (who have debt) had a total debt-to-disposable income ratio of 250 per cent in 2019. That’s far heavier than the debt load that was carried by Canadians of the same age in 1999,\" reads the post. \"Younger indebted millennials (under age 35) aren’t faring much better, with debt loads worth 165 per cent of their disposable income.\" \n\r\n\n\r\n\tHOUSING TOP PRIORITY BUT NO NEW ACTION\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBacked by his recently-rejigged front bench of ministers, the prime minister said that heading into the fall, the rising cost of housing will be one of the minority Liberal government's \"core\" priorities, however he's wrapping up the three-day retreat without announcing any concrete actions on that front.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrudeau said the retreat was productive, included hearing directly from Canadians who are struggling to buy a home or afford rising rents, as well as studying historical trends and StatCan census data, but offered no timelines or specifics on further efforts to tackle the housing crisis beyond building more homes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Everyone agrees that it's a complex issue that requires solutions that bring together all orders of government, the private sector, and the non-profit sector… Middle-class Canadians who want to build equity through homeownership feel increasingly like that dream is out of reach. And now, more and more renters in the housing market means rising demand is causing rent to rise for everyone,\" Trudeau said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe Offer newsletter: Sign up for complete coverage of Canadian real estate news\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tZeroing in on Trudeau's handling of housing and how it's impacting young people in a press conference outside of the House of Commons, Poilievre panned the prime minister for coming away from cabinet without a plan, while comparing the current housing market to prison.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The truth is… for young people and the working class the housing market after eight years of Justin Trudeau is a prison. It's a prison of walls for 350 square foot apartments that cost $2,000 A month. Or parents' basements where young adults of 35 years old live, never having a chance to start a family with their biological clocks running out,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPoilievre spoke about how the \"average mortgage payment in Canada has now risen to $3,500.\" Though, by the end of the availability upon questioning from reporters, he clarified that the figure he was citing was based on one housing analysts' assessment of newly purchased homes with a 20 per cent down payment.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe ended his availability calling for Trudeau to recall the House of Commons, which is on a summer break. \n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\"Open up the House so Canadians can get a home,\" he said. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called it a \"complete failure of leadership\" that Trudeau's cabinet walked away from the east coast waterfront confab without announcing any new housing policy plans.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"One of the most serious things that we're up against. How does that make any sense? We're faced with a housing crisis, and we've got Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who's busy blaming others saying it's not his responsibility. We've got Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who wants to blame cities. New Democrats want to build,\" Singh said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSingh said while he's happy to talk housing \"any day,\" he didn't specifically say whether he agrees with his opposition colleagues in calling for an early House recall. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tINTERNATIONAL STUDENTS 'EASY VILLAN'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrudeau said the government is being careful to not place blame on any one group such as foreign homebuyers, aggressive developers, or international students. Rather he is viewing the current crisis as one simmering for decades, exacerbated by a multitude of factors, and not solvable with one \"silver bullet.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think it's really critical at this moment for the federal government to acknowledge the grief that a younger demographic is feeling about being locked out of housing as renters and as owners,\" Kershaw said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t Still, there was much chatter at the cabinet retreat over the \nLiberals considering a cap\n on international students as one way to tamp down skyrocketing rent. \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We only get through this by rolling up our sleeves and getting the work done… And the good news is, Canada has done this before. We have faced housing crises before in our history,\" Trudeau said, pointing to the post-WWII era when governments built entire neighborhoods.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKershaw said that in order to \"meet the moment,\" the federal government can't then just pick an \"easy villain\" like the current focus on international students.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEchoing this in an interview on CTV News Channel, chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students and international student Maelis Barre called a potential cap “quite disappointing and shameful,” that if pursued would amount to a “band-aid solution” that doesn’t address the root issue of housing affordability.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We know that the housing crisis is rooted in complex economic and policy factors that have evolved over the decades,” Barre said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAsked his views on an international student cap, Poilievre accused current Housing Minister Sean Fraser, who until a few weeks ago was the immigration minister, of ruining the program.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We as Conservatives, we'll make sure that international students have homes, health care, and when they want it: jobs, so that we can get back to a system that supports our universities, attracts the world's brightest people, helps the demographics of our country, but does not leave people living in squalor,” Poilievre said.  \n\r\n\n\r\n\tCLIMATE POLICY 'MORE URGENT THAN EVER'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn the climate front, Trudeau called it a worsening \"emergency\" but similar to the housing issue, the cabinet retreat has not resulted in any announcement of new plans, seeing Trudeau make efforts to tout the existing carbon pricing and rebate program, and industrial green tech efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking about the extreme weather witnessed across the country this summer, from devastating wildfires, to dangerous air quality blanketing much of Canada as a result of the smoke.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nClimate Barometer newsletter: Sign up for more on how a warming planet impacts you\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Climate policies are more urgent than ever. Canadians cannot afford leaders who want to roll them back,\" Trudeau said, in an apparent jab at Poilievre.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile Poilievre didn’t speak to, nor was he asked about the environment file on Wednesday, he has been running paid advertising on his fight against the carbon tax and recently had to postpone his tour of British Columbia and call off an \"axe the tax\" rally in Yukon due to the wildfires ravaging the region.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Gen. Mary Simon, Trudeau orchestrated one of, if not the most consequential reconfigurations to his cabinet since 2015, meant to reset the minority Liberal agenda after eight years in power.\n \n \"What a team,\" Trudeau said, kicking off his post-shuffle press conference, backed by his new roster of ministers.\n \n  \n \nCabinet shuffle: Analysis and list of who's who after Trudeau's overhaul\n \n \n While the prime minister denied that such a sizeable shakeup was a signal that 2023 hasn't been going as the Liberals had hoped, the occasion certainly was the federal political event of the summer so far that will have ripple effects in the months to come.\n \n Trudeau acknowledged this shuffle comes at a time where \"there are storm clouds all around the world,\" that are having real impacts on Canadians, from the war in Ukraine, to the rise in authoritarianism and foreign interference, to the cost-of-living crunch.\n \n \"This is a positive step in a moment of consequential impact in the world, and in the country. We know times are challenging, but this is the team that is going to be able to continue the hard work rolling up their sleeves and delivering for Canadians… as we build a brighter and ambitious future for all Canadians,\" Trudeau said.\n \n \"Making sure that we have the best possible team, aligned to respond to Canadians' challenges with the supports necessary, but also show that optimism, that ambition for getting us through these consequential times... That's what we're focused on.\"\n \n BIG NAMES MOVED TO NEW FILES\n \n As Liberals arrived to a spray of television cameras and political reporters, few said much about what awaited them inside, though a few indicated that it was a good morning and were looking forward to their new roles.\n \n While most ministers were in high spirits, all eyes were on Anita Anand, who was handed one of the most high-profile reassignments on Wednesday. She was bumped from defence to become Treasury Board president.\n \n Asked by reporters how she felt leaving defence with unfinished business, Anand said she was \"extremely excited\" to work as part of the enhanced economic policy team, while indicating Blair is committed to pick up where she left off. \n \n \nPresident of the Treasury Board Anita Anand takes the oath of office as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau looks on during a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld\n \n Former police chief and emergency preparedness point-man Bill Blair replaces Anand as minister of defence, taking on the high-profile international cabinet post amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and continued defence spending pressures.\n \n Taking on the re-prioritized housing file at a time of affordability concerns is Sean Fraser, who moves from immigration to become minister of housing, infrastructure and communities. \n \n Also picking up key economic roles are Randy Boissonnault, who is now the minister of employment, workforce development, but also official languages minister; and Mary Ng who has a similar portfolio to what she held a day ago, now formally titled as minister of export promotion, international trade and economic development.\n \n  \n \nCapital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\n \n \n Trudeau's close ally and longtime friend Dominic LeBlanc becomes public safety, democratic institutions, and intergovernmental affairs minister, seeing him maintain his relationships with the provinces and the ongoing foreign interference public inquiry negotiations, while adding in responsibility for key gun control legislation and RCMP reform. \n \n In a move many predicted, Pablo Rodriguez becomes transport minister tasked with ensuring Canadian travellers are well-treated by Canadian air and rail services, while maintaining the Quebec lieutenant role, while Pascale St-Onge takes over the minister of Canadian heritage portfolio.\n \n This will make the first out lesbian in cabinet Trudeau's new lead on some hot online platform policies, including the ongoing debacle over implementing online news regulations following the passage of Bill C-18. Heritage is a file sources close to St-Onge have said she's interested in and fits as a next step following her time overseeing the sport portfolio.\n \n \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is applauded at a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld\n \n Jean-Yves Duclos becomes minister of public services and procurement, a move he said he didn't see as a demotion after helping navigate the last few post-COVID-19 years.\n \n I am an economist by training... we want to focus very much on the cost of living, helping Canadians put food on the table, also helping grow the economy. And in my new role, I will have many tools to do that,\" he said. \n \n Taking over the health file is outgoing House leader Mark Holland. Karina Gould is the new leader of the government in the House of Commons, poised to lead the Liberals in the Chamber, a key role during question period.\n \n Trudeau announced that when Gould takes parental leave this winter, given she's expecting her second child, Chief Government Whip Steven MacKinnon will take over as House leader until she returns, and current deputy whip Ruby Sahota will fill in for MacKinnon.\n \n Jonathan Wilkinson is now Canada's minister of energy but maintains the natural resources portion of his title. Similarly, Seamus O’Regan maintains his minister of labour role, but has been given the additional responsibility of minister of seniors.\n \n As for other Atlantic Canadians given new roles: Gudie Hutchings holds her role as minister of rural economic development, while adding in responsibility for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Lawrence MacAulay becomes agriculture and agri-food minister, and Ginette Petitpas Taylor takes over for MacAulay as veterans affairs minister and associate minister of national defence.\n \n  \n \nIn pictures: \nMajor Trudeau cabinet shuffle\n \n \n Harjit Sajjan becomes King's Privy Council president and the minister of emergency preparedness, where his past military experience will be tapped into as Canada continues to evolve its natural disaster response plans and respond to a devastating wildfire season. He also becomes the minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada.\n \n Fellow B.C. minister and Paralympian Carla Qualtrough becomes minister of sport and physical activity, picking back up a file she's previously held.\n \n Close Trudeau ally Marc Miller becomes minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, after years spent building relationships with Indigenous communities. Ahmed Hussen has been dropped from housing and becomes minister of international development. Picking up the diversity, inclusion, and persons with disabilities files is Kamal Khera.\n \n A few other ministers who have held their roles over successive previous shuffles are also on the move: Marie-Claude Bibeau becomes Canada's minister of national revenue, aka the minister responsible for the Canada Revenue Agency.\n \n And, former CRA minister Diane Lebouthillier is now the minister of fisheries, oceans and the Canadian coast guard. Should there be further findings regarding the ill-fated Titan submersible, expect this francophone minister to front those questions.\n \n SEVEN ROOKIES IN, SEVEN MINISTERS OUT\n \n As senior government sources confirmed ahead of Wednesday's shuffle, seven ministers are out of cabinet: Omar Alghabra, Joyce Murray, Helena Jaczek, Carolyn Bennett, Marco Mendicino, David Lametti, and Mona Fortier.\n \n These departures have paved the way for the prime minister to promote several backbench Liberal MPs from key battleground ridings in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia.\n \n \nMississauga-Streetsville MP Rechie Valdez arrives for a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Wednesday, July 26, 202. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n \n The seven rookie MPs who have clinched cabinet posts are\n \n  \n Scarborough-Rouge Park, Ont. MP Gary Anandasangaree, who becomes minister of Crown-Indigenous relations after serving as a parliamentary secretary and a Liberal MP since 2015;\n  \n Parkdale-High Park, Ont. MP Arif Virani, who was first elected in 2015, and now has a major new role: Canada's minister of justice and attorney general, picking up several bills left by Lametti before the House;\n  \n Burnaby North-Seymour, B.C. MP Terry Beech, who has also been in the House since 2015, now gets a brand new title, becoming the minister of citizens' services;\n  \n Hochelaga, Que. MP Soraya Martinez Ferrada, becomes minister of tourism and is responsible for the Quebec economic development agency. She was first elected in 2019;\n  \n York Centre, Ont. MP Ya'ara Saks, first elected in a 2020 byelection becomes minister of mental health and addictions, holding on to a role held by a nearby former minister Bennett;\n  \n Kanata-Carleton, Ont. MP Jenna Sudds, first elected in 2021 becomes minister of families, children and social development, picking up the Ottawa-area vacancy left by Fortier's cabinet departure; and\n  \n Mississauga-Streetsville, Ont. MP Rechie Valdez, first elected in 2021 as Canada's first Filipina MP, becomes minister of small business.\n \n \n \"It just really demonstrates that decoupling small business from the larger portfolio shows the importance, and I've been advocating it, for it since I began as an MP, Valdez said to reporters after becoming emotional during her oath-swearing. \"It's incredibly important that we focus on the small businesses, because they are the backbone of our economy and I truly believe that, being that I was a small business entrepreneur myself.\" \n \n While four of the outgoing ministers have announced they aren't running again, Fortier and Mendicino confirmed Wednesday they \ndo plan to seek re-election\n. In his statement, Lametti \ndidn't touch on that question. \n \n Asked by reporters why he chose to remove those three, Trudeau was unspecific, beyond saying it was about \"putting forward the strongest possible team, with fresh energy, and a range of skills.\" \n \n  \n \nMeet the 7 rookie MPs joining Justin Trudeau's cabinet\n \n \n \nIn a statement posted to social media\n Wednesday morning, Mendicino—who was at the centre of shuffle chatter over his handling of hot files—said it had been \"an honour\" to serve as a minister in the immigration and public safety portfolios for nearly four years, and said he plans to stick around as the Liberal MP for Eglinton-Lawrence, Ont.\n \n \"Those who know me well know that politics is in my blood… I have every intention of continuing to serve for the remainder of this mandate, and into the next election,\" Mendicino said.\n \n \"To my cabinet and caucus colleagues, it remains a privilege to work with you. The seating arrangements may move around in the House of Commons from time to time, but we are family and committed to the same cause.\"\n \n In his lengthy public comment, Lametti called his time as justice minister the privilege of his life, congratulated two of his former parliamentary secretaries for their promotions, and reflected on his accomplishments from passing a conversion therapy ban, to tabling a new process for wrongful convictions. \n \n JUST 8 MINISTERS MAINTAIN ROLES\n \n A sign of just how seismic Trudeau's cabinet reconfiguration is, only eight ministers were left untouched:\n \n \nFrancois-Philippe Champagne, left to right, Chrystia Freeland and Mary Ng arrive for a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n \n  \n Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland;\n  \n Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Francois-Philippe Champagne;\n  \n Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly;\n  \n Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault;\n  \n Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu;\n  \n Women and Gender Equality and Youth Minister Marci Ien;\n  \n Minister of Northern Affairs Dan Vandal, who also oversees Prairie economic development; and\n  \n Minister Filomena Tassi who is responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario.\n \n \n Trudeau defended his decision to keep these ministers in their current roles, particularly Freeland, at a time where Canadians continue to feel the pinch of inflation and are uncertain about the country's economic trajectory.\n \n \"We need to continue to put our very best foot forward and work even harder,\" he said, adding that he's \"so proud\" to continue this work alongside his deputy prime minister.\n \n \"We're bolstering that economic team with the likes of Jean-Yves Duclos, Sean Fraser, Anita Anand and others that are going to continue to step up and make sure Canadians know that we've got their backs, but we've also got them into the kind of ambitious and optimistic future I know Canadians want, and that is a clear contrast from the 'brokenness' philosophy that the leader of the Conservative Party continues to put forward,\" Trudeau said. \n \n Trudeau's entire top tier was invited to attend the ceremony at the governor general's residence, regardless of if they were on the move or not. Also there to watch were some of Trudeau's top PMO staffers, Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre, and a number of ministers' aides. The shuffle is now likely to also trigger a considerable staffing shakeup.  \n \n WHY SHUFFLE NOW?\n \n A senior government source told CTV News that Trudeau and his inner circle have looked at this shuffle as \"fortifying\" the prime minister's economic team around issues such as housing affordability and the clean energy transition, to present a clear contrast to their main Conservative opponents when it comes to how they view and communicate on these issues.\n \n It's also been widely discussed that elevating high-performers into key posts today may help the Liberals, after eight years in power, present a refreshed face to make the case to the Canadian public that they're re-electable.\n \n \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau arrives for a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n \n Wednesday's changes have not changed the size of the cabinet, with 38 members—19 men and 19 women— in the gender-balanced cabinet, not counting the prime minister. Maintaining gender parity is a standard Trudeau set when his first cabinet was sworn-in in 2015.\n \n This shakeup is the first major change since the Liberals' 2021 election win, and the prime minister is hoping with these changes to lock in the team he will lead into the next election, currently slated for 2025.\n \n Asked Wednesday whether he could commit to not pulling the plug on the current minority Parliament and launching the country into an early election, Trudeau was not absolute, but said they still have \"so much work to do over the coming years.\"\n \n With all parties continuing to prepare for the next election, the opposition is already signalling that these changes aren't going to be enough to turn around slipping Liberal polling numbers.\n \n From Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre stating Trudeau should be the one getting a new job, to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, and Green Party Deputy Leader Jonathan Pedneault all noting several problem files remain, the reset team has their work cut out for them.\n \n \"Despite the appearance of a new beginning, this government is poised to continue in the same direction at a time when the problems facing Canadians warrant foundational changes to our economy, our politics and our federation,\" Pedneault said in a statement. \"Just like Pierre Poilievre taking off his glasses, Justin Trudeau's cabinet reshuffle has more to do with cosmetics than politics.\" \n \n Last on the itinerary for the new cabinet on their big day, was a 4 p.m. EDT meeting in West Block.\n \n Holding cabinet meetings shortly after a shuffle is something Trudeau has done in the past, with analysts suggesting it's an effort to signal that the team is rolling up their sleeves and getting to work right away.\n \n Trudeau's office confirmed Wednesday that \"in the coming weeks\" changes will be announced to the makeup of cabinet committees, and the membership of a new \"National Security Council\" that is being billed as \"a new forum for ministers to deliberate on and address issues of pressing concern to Canada's domestic and international security.\"\n \n Then, it'll be on the new ministry to get down to work on the refocused promises Trudeau mandates them to prioritize, a prepare for the September return of Parliament. \n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The agency scheduled a public hearing for Oct. 5, a required step before deciding to seek a court-ordered recall.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn May the agency asked ARC to recall the inflators, which it says are responsible for at least seven injuries and two deaths in the U.S. and Canada since 2009. But ARC has refused to issue a full-scale recall, setting the stage for the possible court fight.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop headlines on electric vehicles, and all the latest automotive news \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMessages were left Tuesday seeking comment from ARC. The company maintains that no safety defect exists, that NHTSA's demand is based on a hypothesis rather than technical conclusions, and that the agency has no authority to order a parts manufacturer to announce recalls.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"These air bag inflators may rupture when the vehicle's air bag is commanded to deploy, causing metal debris to be forcefully ejected into the passenger compartment of the vehicle,\" NHTSA wrote in an initial decision document. \"A rupturing air bag inflator poses an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death to vehicle occupants.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNHTSA wants ARC to recall inflators in driver and passenger front air bags from at least a dozen automakers. Neither ARC nor the auto industry has released a full list of vehicle models with the kind of air bag inflators that have exploded. But at least 25 million of the 284 million vehicles on U.S. roads are believed to contain them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOwners of vehicles made by at least a dozen auto brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and Kia -- are left to wonder anxiously whether their vehicles contain driver or front passenger inflators made by ARC.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThough ARC is resisting a full-scale recall, automakers have conducted seven smaller recalls of inflators since 2017 that were attributed to isolated manufacturing problems. Those recalls included one that General Motors announced in May involving nearly 1 million vehicles. Ultimately, automakers are responsible for the recalls.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInitially NHTSA said that an estimated 67 million inflators should be recalled, but it revised the number to 52 million due to manufacturer responses in its investigation that over-counted the number, the agency said in documents issued Tuesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNHTSA contends that byproducts from welding during manufacturing can clog a vent inside the inflator canister that is designed to let gas escape to quickly fill air bags in a crash. In the defective products, pressure can build to the point where the canister is blown apart.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe inflators that NHTSA seeks to recall are from before 2018, when ARC finished installing scopes to monitor welding byproducts and the vents. NHTSA said in April that it was unaware of any explosions involving inflators that were manufactured after the scopes were installed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tARC, acquired in 2016 by Chinese real estate developer Yinyi Group, has said in letters to the government that it can't state for sure whether its inflators might rupture again.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Even with appropriate industry standards and efforts by manufacturers to minimize the risks of failures, the manufacturing processes may not completely eliminate the risk of occasional or isolated failures,\" ARC wrote.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company further argued that the federal motor vehicle safety act \"does not require vehicles and equipment to never experience a failure in the field. Rather the Safety Act seeks to protect the public against unreasonable risks.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tARC said that during NHTSA's eight-year investigation into the inflators, air bag makers, automakers and the government have been informed of any unexplained ruptures on the roads.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut NHTSA wrote on Tuesday that it's aware of seven U.S. ruptures of ARC inflators and at least two outside the U.S. A rupture happened as recently as March 22, the agency said, adding that inflators have exploded outside of groups that were previously recalled.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"An inflator that explosively ruptures, propelling metal fragments at high velocity into an occupied passenger compartment of a motor vehicle -- and into the occupants themselves -- cannot simply be dismissed as a normal manufacturing anomaly, with vehicle owners left uninformed yet bearing the risk of the peril they and their occupants face,\" the agency wrote.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne person who died after an ARC inflator explosion was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. She was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. Beaudoin and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSteve Polich, a Michigan attorney representing Beaudoin's family in a lawsuit against ARC, General Motors and air bag assembly maker Toyoda Gosei, welcomed NHTSA's finding and said in an email that it supports his case.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

With the NDP pushing for the Liberals to issue an additional $500 Canada Housing Benefit payment and the Conservatives calling for a plan to build more houses and bring prices down, where Canadians call home is set to remain a hot political file this fall.\n \n Asked whether the Liberals' promised new housing plans will come as part of the upcoming fall economic statement, Fraser said he is planning to unveil what he's been working on, in advance of that, with potential funding attached coming as part of the fall economic update.\n \n \"There will be a suite of measures that we put forward, but I'm not going to wait for some artificial date to share news of things that could help build more houses today,\" Fraser said.\n \n NATIONAL HORSE RACE TIGHTENING?\n \n Throughout the summer, overall horse race polling from Nanos and other polling firms have \nshown the Conservatives in the lead\n, gaining ground on the Liberals as time went on. However, Nanos' latest figures suggest the margin between the Liberals and the Conservatives is closing, to be within the margin of error and Poilievre's party only slightly ahead.\n \n \"Four weeks ago, you know, we had the Conservatives with about an eight or nine point advantage over the Liberals, like they were in strong minority territory, just a little shy of majority,\" Nanos said. \"So what was a massive advantage four weeks ago is now a little more of a horse race.\"\n \n Nanos suggested this may be the result of a stock market-like \"technical correction,\" because \"one party is overpriced.\"\n \n  \n \nAccess the latest Nanos polls and national survey results here\n \n \n \"I think people said, 'well, maybe we'd like change but a Conservative majority government? Not sure if I want that,'\" Nanos said.\n \n He compared the current situation for Poilievre, to Stephen Harper in 2006, saying that while there are a significant number of Canadians that are game for change and may be ready for a new prime minister, they aren't sure that they want the Conservatives to have a majority.\n \n \"I think that's realistically where we're at right now,\" Nanos said, suggesting this weekend's Conservative policy convention could be critical for whether Canadians are ready to view the party as a government in waiting.\n \n METHODOLOGY\n \n \nNanos conducted an RDD dual frame (land-and cell-lines) hybrid telephone and online random survey of 1,044 Canadians, 18 years of age or older, between September 2ndand 4th, 2023, as part of an omnibus survey. The margin of error for this survey is ±3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The number of strikes and threatened strikes is growing, involving Hollywood actors and writers, sizable settlements with railroads and major concessions by corporate giants like UPS.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShawn Fain, who won the UAW's presidency this spring in the first direct election by members, has set high expectations and assured union members that they can achieve significant gains if they are willing to walk picket lines.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a speech to a Labor Day parade crowd in Detroit on Monday, Fain said that if the companies don't come up with a fair contract, \"come Sept. 14, we're going to take action to get it by any means necessary.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFain has characterized the contract talks with Detroit automakers as a form of war between billionaires and ordinary middle-class workers. Last month, in an act of showmanship during a Facebook Live event, Fain condemned a contract proposal from Stellantis as \"trash\" -- and tossed a copy of it into a wastebasket, \"where it belongs,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOver the past decade, the Detroit Three have emerged as robust profit-makers. They've collectively posted net income of US$164 billion over the past decade, US$20 billion of it this year. The CEOs of all three major automakers earn multiple millions in annual compensation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking last month to Ford workers at a plant in Louisville, Kentucky, Fain complained about one standard for the corporate class and another for ordinary workers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"They get out-of-control salaries,\" he said. \"They get pensions they don't even need. They get top-rate health care. They work whatever schedule they want. The majority of our members do not get a pension nowadays. It's crazy. We get substandard health care. We don't get to work remotely.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUAW members have voted overwhelmingly to authorize its leaders to call a strike. So, too, have Canadian auto workers, whose contracts end four days later and who have designated Ford as their target.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe UAW hasn't said whether it will select one target automaker. It could strike all three, though doing so could deplete the union's strike fund in under three months.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn the other hand, if a strike lasted even just 10 days, it would cost the three automakers nearly a billion dollars, the Anderson Economic Group has calculated. During a 40-day UAW strike in 2019, GM alone lost US$3.6 billion.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast week, the union filed charges of unfair labor practices against Stellantis and GM, which it said have yet to offer counterproposals. As for Ford, Fain asserted that its response, by rejecting most of the union's demands, \"insults our very worth.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAll three automakers have countered that the union's charges are baseless and that they're seeking a fair deal that would allow them to invest in the future.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, suggested that the strong U.S. job market and the companies' outsize profits have given Fain leverage in negotiations. In addition, he noted, the automakers are poised to release a slew of new electric vehicles that would be delayed by a strike. And they have only a limited supply of vehicles to withstand a prolonged walkout.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"They are vulnerable,\" Masters said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The question really is,\" he said, \"are the parties willing to move on some of these things at the table? That hasn't been evident yet.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEven Fain has described the union's proposals as \"audacious\" in demanding the restoration of traditional defined-benefit pensions for new hires; an end to tiers of wages; pension increases for retirees; and -- perhaps boldest of all -- a 32-hour week for 40 hours of pay.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCurrently, UAW workers who were hired after 2007 don't receive defined-benefit pensions. Their health benefits are less generous, too. For years, the union gave up general pay raises and lost cost-of-living wage increases to help the companies control costs. Though top-scale assembly workers earn US$32.32 an hour, temporary workers start at just under US$17. Still, full-time workers have received profit-sharing checks ranging this year from US$9,716 at Ford to US$14,760 at Stellantis.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt Detroit's Labor Day Parade, workers said a strike appears likely now.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJason Craig, a worker at a Stellantis parts warehouse near Detroit, said his company appears most likely to be the strike target, but he said the union might go to Ford because it seems more family-oriented. Fain reiterated Monday that all three companies remain strike targets.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPerhaps the biggest issue blocking a contract agreement is union representation at 10 EV battery plants that the companies have proposed. Most of these plants are joint ventures with South Korean battery makers, which want to pay less.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"These battery workers deserve the same wage and salary standards that generations of auto workers have fought for,\" Fain told members.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe union fears that because EVs are simpler to build, with fewer moving parts, fewer workers will be needed to assemble them. In addition, workers at combustion engine and transmission plants will likely lose jobs in the transition; they'll need a place to go.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFain, a 54-year-old electrician who came out of a Chrysler factory in Kokomo, Indiana, is among several labor leaders across the economy who have been escalating their demands and flexing their muscles. So far this year, 247 strikes have occurred involving 341,000 workers -- the most since Cornell University began tracking strikes in 2021, though still well below the numbers during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMasters suggested that the automakers wouldn't be able to quickly replace striking workers. The tight job market, diminished interest in manufacturing jobs and comparatively modest wages would make it difficult to hire enough workers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSome auto workers regard the UPS contract, with a US$49-an-hour top wage for experienced drivers, as a benchmark for their negotiations. Others say they're just hoping to get near that figure.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut automakers say a generous settlement would stick them with costs far above their competitors' just as they start producing more EVs. The inability to bring Hyundai-Kia, Nissan, Volkswagen, Honda and Toyota factories into the union has weakened the UAW's leverage, said Harry Katz, a labor professor at Cornell.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf you include the value of their benefits, workers at the Detroit 3 automakers receive around US$60 an hour. The corresponding figure at foreign-based automakers with U.S. factories is just US$40 to US$45, Katz said. Much of the disparity reflects pensions and health care.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf the Detroit companies end up with higher labor costs, they'll pass them on to consumers, making vehicles more expensive, said Sam Fiorani, an analyst with AutoForecast Solutions, a consulting firm.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"More than half of the vehicles built in the U.S. are in nonunion plants,\" he said. \"So if you raise the price to build a unionized vehicle, you could price yourself out of competition with vehicles already built in North America.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA strike of more than a couple of weeks would reduce still-tight supplies of vehicles on Detroit automakers' dealer lots. With demand still strong, prices would rise.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe UAW's members are \"reminding management that management can't operate those factories without a settlement,\" Katz said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMasters and Katz say there's still time to settle without a strike. Katz predicts a settlement short of UPS numbers, possibly with 3 per cent general pay raises plus cost-of-living adjustments, increased company contributions to 401(k) accounts for newer workers and faster transitions to top pay.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat said, Katz suggested, Fain has to back up his tough talk: \"He's got to prove himself.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t--------\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nAP Writers Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Kentucky, and Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He said it's unclear whether a child who is not transitioning would be allowed to use another name.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Those are all situations and scenarios that we're going to be working with school divisions so that we can provide clarity to what the policy would look like.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe said notification to parents is required if a child also has a desire to change their gender identity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nIf you're on Telegram, subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on top stories\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA similar move earlier this year in New Brunswick was faced by intense opposition by LGBTQ groups.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn New Brunswick, child and youth advocate Kelly Lamrock said the policy violated the province's Human Rights Act, the Education Act and children's Charter rights.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSaskatchewan's human rights code says discrimination over gender identity and gender express is against the law.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDuncan said he doesn't have all the answers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I try to treat everyone and, imperfect as I am in this, with respect, with kindness, to carry myself with humility,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"But I also know, as minister of education, I'm responsible ultimately for nearly 200,000 children in the education system.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOpposition NDP Leader Carla Beck described the government's move as \"cynical and divisive politics\" and an attempt to cater to right-wing voters.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBeck said she thinks it's a response to the Saskatchewan United Party, a new right-of-centre movement, which gained traction in a recent rural byelection. It took 23 per cent of the vote, more than analysts expected.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It certainly isn't a policy that is designed to improve our schools or make our classrooms more welcoming,\" Beck said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe said she supports parental involvement in schools, but not outing kids.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I am deeply frustrated, and frankly, angry.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAleana Young, an NDP MLA in Regina, used profanity on social media in calling Premier Scott Moe and Duncan \"cowards.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs part of naming and pronoun changes, the province also announced Tuesday new rules around sexual education.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt said that parents and guardians must be informed of a school's sexual education curriculum and given the option to decline their child's participation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe province recently had a review done of its sexual education curriculum after Planned Parenthood inadvertently took inappropriate sexual material into a high school.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDuncan said schools must pause any involvement with third-party organizations connected to sexual health education.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 22, 2023.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n-- With files from Kelly Geraldine Malone in Saskatoon\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Its medicinal use dates back hundreds of years, according to a 2017 study.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the United States, its primary medicinal use has been as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant dietary supplement to relieve osteoarthritis and irritable bowel syndrome, he added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut this is the first clinical trial that directly compares curcumin/turmeric to omeprazole in treating dyspepsia, Pongpirul said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tQUESTIONS ABOUT TURMERIC'S IMPACT\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt makes sense that research would investigate turmeric's impact on indigestion, because its compound curcumin has been studied in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis, said Dr. Yuying Luo, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of gastroenterology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSome studies have shown that curcumin was helpful in conjunction with other medications, she added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut there were some questions Luo had about the new study.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe scale that the researchers used to measure symptoms is not the most common one used for assessing improvement of indigestion, she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLuo would also like to see what the results would be if symptoms were measured more frequently.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I don't think this one study alone is enough for me to say, 'I recommend this,'\" she said. \"Proceed with caution.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut because there's a lot of ongoing research investigating the compound's impact on different inflammatory conditions, more insights could be close at hand, Luo added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Curcumin is not going away,\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSHOULD YOU START TAKING TURMERIC?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShould you up the turmeric in your diet for better digestion? Talk to your doctor first, Luo said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThere have been a few case studies of curcumin and liver injury, and it is important to make sure turmeric doesn't interact poorly with any of the other medications you are on, she added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Consumers should be aware of side effects of curcumin extracts such as allergy and bleeding risk, especially for those who take anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications,\" Pongpirul said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat said, curcumin and turmeric is \"generally considered safe when consumed in the amounts typically found in food,\" he added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTypically, turmeric spices contain around 3 per cent curcumin, according to a 2009 study.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe dose of 2 grams given in this study is relatively low compared to extracts commonly found in curcumin supplements, Pongpirul said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt may not be necessary to take both turmeric and omeprazole together if just taking one or the other works similarly to reduce risk of side effects, he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough she needs to see more studies before she starts recommending turmeric as a treatment, Luo did say that she thinks it makes sense to talk with your doctor about if you should try it in addition to your medications.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe does add a caveat, however: People trying these alternatives should give them each two to four weeks to see what the full impact is.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"If it is helpful, that's wonderful,\" Luo added. \"If not, that's the tough part of treating disorders … not all patients are the same and have the same response to medication.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Participants and their parents were asked to categorize these words as either “negative” words such as untrustworthy, “neutral” words such as chaotic, or “positive” words such as funny.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAfter this, the adolescent participants were placed inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, in an effort to measure their brain activity while presented with negative, neutral, or positive feedback words, the study explains. Adolescents were also falsely told that their parents would be assigning the words that best fit their personality. Each word was prefaced with, “Your mother/father thinks you are…”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAfter the MRI scans were complete, participants were asked to recall as many of the feedback words they could. According to the study’s findings, the increase of mood was “blunted” in adolescents for praise, compared to the decrease of mood following words associated with criticism.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop health headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn other words, teenage brains were more likely to filter out words of praise than words of criticism. This was particularly the case in in the depressed sub-group.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThrough analyzing the brain scans generated by the MRI machine, researchers also found that depressed participants showed a higher degree of brain activity compared to non-depressed participants while confronted with critical — or negative — words. This increased brain activity mostly lit up in what’s called the “subgenual anterior cingulate cortex,” which is a region of the brain largely responsible for regulating emotions.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe researchers said these findings indicate a larger pattern about how self-perception is influenced by criticism.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“This may indicate that adolescents with depression are especially sensitive to parental criticism: they view themselves already negative, and rely less on their self-views when confronted with parental criticism,” they state in the study.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Regardless of depression status, however, adolescent's mood increased when praise was more consistent with self-views.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe study adds that identifying personality characteristics adolescents value about themselves may be key to improving their depressed mood.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

It's part of a shift to treat fall updates of the COVID-19 vaccine much like getting a yearly flu shot.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nCOVID-19 Brief newsletter: Sign up for fresh insights and analysis on the pandemic\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThere's still another step: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must sign off. A CDC advisory panel is set to issue recommendations Tuesday on who most needs the updated shots. Vaccinations could begin later this week, and both the COVID-19 and flu shot can be given at the same visit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA third vaccine maker, Novavax, said its updated shot is still being reviewed by the FDA.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCOVID-19 hospitalizations have been rising since late summer although --- thanks to lasting immunity from prior vaccinations and infections --- not nearly as much as this time last year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut protection wanes over time and the coronavirus continually churns out new variants that can dodge prior immunity. It's been a year since the last time the vaccines were tweaked, and only about 20% of adults ever received that earlier update.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Vaccination remains critical to public health and continued protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death,\" FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said in a statement. \"We very much encourage those who are eligible to consider getting vaccinated.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop coronavirus headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJust like earlier vaccinations, the fall round is cleared for adults and children as young as age 6 months. FDA said starting at age 5, most people can get a single dose even if they've never had a prior COVID-19 shot. Younger children might need additional doses depending on their history of COVID-19 infections and vaccinations.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe FDA pointedly isn't calling this latest round a \"booster\" but instead a vaccine updated to better match the currently circulating virus. The new recipe targets an omicron variant named XBB.1.5 -- replacing outdated combination vaccines that mixed protection against the original coronavirus strain and an older version of omicron.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnd while even the XBB.1.5 variant is no longer dominant, FDA determined that it's close enough to coronavirus strains causing most COVID-19 illnesses today to offer good cross-protection. Like earlier versions, they're expected to be most protective against COVID-19's worst consequences rather than mild infection.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut while the FDA's decision allows for wide use of the updated shots, the CDC will decide how strongly different groups are urged to get them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFederal officials have said the shots still will be free to most Americans through private insurance or Medicare. But for the uninsured or underinsured, the CDC is working with health departments, clinics and certain pharmacies to temporarily provide free shots.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t------\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Our government is seeking to make life more affordable for Canadians, so this is about smarter, not smaller government,\" Anand said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAsked about the Liberals' saving efforts, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre—who has been calling on the federal government to cut back spending—told reporters earlier this week he doesn't think Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be able to achieve these savings.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Justin Trudeau will never find savings because he is incompetent with money. He believes budgets balance themselves,\" Poilievre said, vowing that if he becomes prime minister he'd implement a new law requiring the government to find one dollar of savings for every dollar spent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's something that we could use as a hard discipline, the same discipline that single mothers, or factory workers, or small business owners follow every day managing their money, should be the discipline that we follow,\" Poilievre said. \"We're going to balance the budget to bring home lower inflation and lower interest rates.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnand sought to make it clear in the interview that the Liberal plan is not comparable to the previous Stephen Harper Conservative government's \"Deficit Reduction Action Plan\" which she said made \"short-sighted cuts that had to be reversed\" when the Trudeau government came to power in 2015.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nCapital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters earlier this week that he too is concerned about the types of cuts the Liberals are eyeing, but because of what that could mean for services that Canadians are relying on when they're already \"feeling so squeezed.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There are places where we could certainly save money, where we could put in place some savings. We could stop the billions of dollars of subsidies to already profitable companies. That's a place where we should absolutely be cutting. That's a poor use of our resources.

How the old enemies are now becoming allies", "summary": "", "content": "\n     \n     \nTEGUCIGALPA, Honduras  - \n\n     \n    \n For decades, preventing dengue fever in Honduras has meant teaching people to fear mosquitoes and avoid their bites. Now, Hondurans are being educated about a potentially more effective way to control the disease -- and it goes against everything they've learned.\n \n Which explains why a dozen people cheered last month as Tegucigalpa resident Hector Enriquez held a glass jar filled with mosquitoes above his head, and then freed the buzzing insects into the air. Enriquez, a 52-year-old mason, had volunteered to help publicize a plan to suppress dengue by releasing millions of special mosquitoes in the Honduran capital.\n \n  \n \nTop health headlines, all in one place\n \n \n The mosquitoes Enriquez unleashed in his El Manchen neighbourhood -- an area rife with dengue -- were bred by scientists to carry bacteria called Wolbachia that interrupt transmission of the disease. When these mosquitoes reproduce, they pass the bacteria to their offspring, reducing future outbreaks.\n \n This emerging strategy for battling dengue was pioneered over the last decade by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, and it is being tested in more than a dozen countries. With more than half the world's population at risk of contracting dengue, the World Health Organization is paying close attention to the mosquito releases in Honduras, and elsewhere, and it is poised to promote the strategy globally.\n \n In Honduras, where 10,000 people are known to be sickened by dengue each year, Doctors Without Borders is partnering with the mosquito program over the next six months to release close to 9 million mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacteria.\n \n \"There is a desperate need for new approaches,\" said Scott O'Neill, founder of the mosquito program.\n \n DENGUE DEFIES TYPICAL PREVENTION\n \n Scientists have made great strides in recent decades in reducing the threat of infectious diseases, including mosquito-borne viruses like malaria. But dengue is the exception: Its rate of infection keeps going up.\n \n Models estimate that around 400 million people across some 130 countries are infected each year with dengue. Mortality rates from dengue are low -- an estimated 40,000 people die each year from it -- but outbreaks can overwhelm health systems and force many people to miss work or school.\n \n \"When you come down with a case of dengue fever, it's often akin to getting the worst case of influenza you can imagine,\" said Conor McMeniman, a mosquito researcher at Johns Hopkins University. It's commonly known as \"breakbone fever\" for a reason, McMeniman said.\n \n Traditional methods of preventing mosquito-borne illnesses haven't been nearly as effective against dengue.\n \n \nEdgard Boquín, a project leader working with Doctors Without Borders, holds a glass jar filled with mosquitoes before their release in neighborhoods rife with dengue, in a facility in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Tuesday, Aug. 22, 2023. The mosquitoes come from eggs, produced in a World Mosquito Program bio factory to carry the bacteria Wolbachia, which interrupts the transmission of dengue. (AP Photo/Elmer Martinez)\n \n The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that most commonly spread dengue have been resistant to insecticides, which have fleeting results even in the best-case scenario. And because dengue virus comes in four different forms, it is harder to control through vaccines.\n \n Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are also a challenging foe because they are most active during the day -- meaning that's when they bite -- so bed nets aren't much help against them. Because these mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet environments, and in dense cities, climate change and urbanization are expected to make the fight against dengue even harder.\n \n \"We need better tools,\" said Raman Velayudhan, a researcher from the WHO's Global Neglected Tropical Diseases Program. \"Wolbachia is definitely a long-term, sustainable solution.\"\n \n Velayudhan and other experts from the WHO plan to publish a recommendation as early as this month to promote further testing of the Wolbachia strategy in other parts of the world.\n \n SCIENTISTS SURPRISED BY BACTERIA\n \n The Wolbachia strategy has been decades in the making.\n \n The bacteria exist naturally in about 60 per cent of insect species, just not in the Aedes aegypti mosquito.\n \n \"We worked for years on this,\" said O'Neill, 61, who with help from his students in Australia eventually figured out how to transfer the bacteria from fruit flies into Aedes aegypti mosquito embryos by using microscopic glass needles.\n \n Around 40 years ago, scientists aimed to use Wolbachia in a different way: to drive down mosquito populations. Because male mosquitoes carrying the bacteria only produce offspring with females that also have it, scientists would release infected male mosquitoes into the wild to breed with uninfected females, whose eggs would not hatch.\n \n But along the way, O'Neill's team made a surprising discovery: Mosquitoes carrying Wolbachia didn't spread dengue -- or other related diseases, including yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya.\n \n And since infected females pass Wolbachia to their offspring, they will eventually \"replace\" a local mosquito population with one that carries the virus-blocking bacteria.\n \n The replacement strategy has required a major shift in thinking about mosquito control, said Oliver Brady, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n \n \"Everything in the past has been about killing mosquitoes, or at the very least, preventing mosquitoes from biting humans,\" Brady said.\n \n Since O'Neill's lab first tested the replacement strategy in Australia in 2011, the World Mosquito Program has run trials affecting 11 million people across 14 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Fiji and Vietnam.\n \n The results are promising. In 2019, a large-scale field trial in Indonesia showed a 76 per cent drop in reported dengue cases after Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were released.\n \n  \n \nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n \n \n  \n \nNightly Briefing newsletter: Sign up for an in-depth look at the day’s most compelling news\n \n \n Still, questions remain about whether the replacement strategy will be effective -- and cost effective -- on a global scale, O'Neill said. The three-year Tegucigalpa trial will cost US $900,000, or roughly $10 per person that Doctors Without Borders expects it to protect.\n \n Scientists aren't yet sure how Wolbachia actually blocks viral transmission. And it isn't clear whether the bacteria will work equally well against all strains of the virus, or if some strains might become resistant over time, said Bobby Reiner, a mosquito researcher at the University of Washington.\n \n \"It's certainly not a one-and-done fix, forever guaranteed,\" Reiner said.\n \n SPECIAL MOSQUITOES BRED IN COLOMBIA\n \n Many of the world's mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia were hatched in a warehouse in Medellin, Colombia, where the World Mosquito Program runs a factory that breeds 30 million of them per week.\n \n The factory imports dried mosquito eggs from different parts of the world to ensure the specially bred mosquitoes it eventually releases will have similar qualities to local populations, including resistance to insecticides, said Edgard Boquin, one of the Honduras project leaders working for Doctors Without Borders.\n \n The dried eggs are placed in water with powdered food. Once they hatch, they are allowed to breed with the \"mother colony\" -- a lineage that carries Wolbachia and is made up of more females than males.\n \n \nA Doctors Without Borders' worker releases laboratory-bred mosquitoes infected with bacteria that interrupt the transmission of dengue, in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Thursday, Aug. 24, 2023.

(AP Photo/Elmer Martinez)\n \n A constant buzz fills the room where the insects mate in cube-shaped cages made of mosquito nets. Caretakers ensure they have the best diet: Males get sugared water, while females \"bite\" into pouches of human blood kept at 97 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).\n \n \"We have the perfect conditions,\" the factory's coordinator, Marlene Salazar, said.\n \n Once workers confirm that the new mosquitoes carry Wolbachia, their eggs are dried and filled into pill-like capsules to be sent off to release sites.\n \n DOCTORS ENLIST HELP IN HONDURAS\n \n The Doctors Without Borders team in Honduras recently went door-to-door in a hilly neighbourhood of Tegucigalpa to enlist residents' help in incubating mosquito eggs bred in the Medellin factory.\n \n At half a dozen houses, they received permission to hang from tree branches glass jars containing water and a mosquito egg-filled capsule. After about 10 days, the mosquitoes would hatch and fly off.\n \n That same day, a dozen young workers from Doctors Without Borders fanned out across Northern Tegucigalpa on motorcycles carrying jars of the already hatched dengue-fighting mosquitoes and, at designated sites, released thousands of them into the breeze.\n \n Because community engagement is key to the program's success, doctors and volunteers have spent the past six months educating neighbourhood leaders, including influential gang members, to get their permission to work in areas under their control.\n \n Some of the most common questions from the community were about whether Wolbachia would harm people or the environment. Workers explained that any bites from the special mosquitoes or their offspring were harmless.\n \n Maria Fernanda Marin, a 19-year-old student, works for Doctors Without Borders in a facility where Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are hatched for eventual release. She proudly shows neighbours a photo of her arm covered in bites to help earn their trust.\n \n Lourdes Betancourt, 63, another volunteer with the Doctors Without Borders team, was at first suspicious of the new strategy. But Betancourt -- who has been sickened by dengue several times -- now encourages her neighbours to let the \"good mosquitoes\" grow in their yards.\n \n \"I tell people not to be afraid, that this isn't anything bad, to have trust,\" Betancourt said. \"They are going to bite you, but you won't get dengue.\"\n \n ------\n \n \nBurakoff reported from New York City.

The recommendations will then be put into use…”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We want to engage with the community, all across HRM and have a better understanding of what do we have, what do we need, what are the gaps,” says Pamela Lovelace, municipal councilor for the area affected by the suburban wildfire more than three months ago.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe says while the HRVA process started before this summer's emergencies, the floods and the fires put the need front and center.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut some residents say the HRVA doesn’t address how this summer’s emergencies were handled.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It's a good step in the right direction, but I don't think it's enough,” says Martin Kenward of the Tantallon Wildfire Life Safety Coalition.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe coalition represents neighborhoods hit hardest by the wildfires.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe group has penned letters to both Mayor Mike Savage and Premier Tim Houston calling for participation in what it’s calling a “360-degree review” of what happened.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“The time is now for you to prioritize the safety of citizens in the municipality,” the letter reads.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“The many communities in and adjacent to Upper Tantallon and Hammonds Plains are gravely concerned that the myriad lessons arising from this spring’s devastating wildland fires will be forgotten, ignored, or worse still not even be identified and thereby not acted upon.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It would encompass not only things that happened during the fire, after the fire, but that were known before the fire, things related to egress, and communications,” says Kenward.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe adds while the HRVA and incident after action reports already in progress are important, residents want more involvement.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It’s a process that will allow us to do a retrospective on what happened, what needs to happen, and where we should go,” he says, “we need to learn from this, we need to help our communities, and I think that active engagement is something that should be a new norm.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLovelace says city's wildfire after report plan is in its final stages and should be released publicly soon, while she says the province has not said when its examination of the fire response will be finalized.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe says any 360-degree review would have to be initiated by the province as the government body to first respond to the disaster.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“The wildfire was primarily led by the province of Nova Scotia and the Department of Natural Resources and Renewables for the first ten days, so any kind of (review) we would have to have the province lead that, and so I look forward to reading the provincial after action report and ensuring that we understand where their gaps are, so we can work forward together better,” Lovelace adds.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the meantime, Regan is encouraging as many people as possible to weigh in on the city's \nHRVA\n at one of its upcoming public engagement sessions.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Let's get it done now, come out and tell HRM what you want,” he says, “it’s more than just flood plains, it’s wind storms, it’s vulnerable people….We have to think about what’s going to happen with climate change making more terrible storms. The best restoration is prevention.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nFor more Nova Scotia news visit our dedicated \nprovincial page\n.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Gen. Mary Simon, Trudeau orchestrated one of, if not the most consequential reconfigurations to his cabinet since 2015, meant to reset the minority Liberal agenda after eight years in power.\n \n \"What a team,\" Trudeau said, kicking off his post-shuffle press conference, backed by his new roster of ministers.\n \n  \n \nCabinet shuffle: Analysis and list of who's who after Trudeau's overhaul\n \n \n While the prime minister denied that such a sizeable shakeup was a signal that 2023 hasn't been going as the Liberals had hoped, the occasion certainly was the federal political event of the summer so far that will have ripple effects in the months to come.\n \n Trudeau acknowledged this shuffle comes at a time where \"there are storm clouds all around the world,\" that are having real impacts on Canadians, from the war in Ukraine, to the rise in authoritarianism and foreign interference, to the cost-of-living crunch.\n \n \"This is a positive step in a moment of consequential impact in the world, and in the country. We know times are challenging, but this is the team that is going to be able to continue the hard work rolling up their sleeves and delivering for Canadians… as we build a brighter and ambitious future for all Canadians,\" Trudeau said.\n \n \"Making sure that we have the best possible team, aligned to respond to Canadians' challenges with the supports necessary, but also show that optimism, that ambition for getting us through these consequential times... That's what we're focused on.\"\n \n BIG NAMES MOVED TO NEW FILES\n \n As Liberals arrived to a spray of television cameras and political reporters, few said much about what awaited them inside, though a few indicated that it was a good morning and were looking forward to their new roles.\n \n While most ministers were in high spirits, all eyes were on Anita Anand, who was handed one of the most high-profile reassignments on Wednesday. She was bumped from defence to become Treasury Board president.\n \n Asked by reporters how she felt leaving defence with unfinished business, Anand said she was \"extremely excited\" to work as part of the enhanced economic policy team, while indicating Blair is committed to pick up where she left off. \n \n \nPresident of the Treasury Board Anita Anand takes the oath of office as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau looks on during a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld\n \n Former police chief and emergency preparedness point-man Bill Blair replaces Anand as minister of defence, taking on the high-profile international cabinet post amid the ongoing war in Ukraine and continued defence spending pressures.\n \n Taking on the re-prioritized housing file at a time of affordability concerns is Sean Fraser, who moves from immigration to become minister of housing, infrastructure and communities. \n \n Also picking up key economic roles are Randy Boissonnault, who is now the minister of employment, workforce development, but also official languages minister; and Mary Ng who has a similar portfolio to what she held a day ago, now formally titled as minister of export promotion, international trade and economic development.\n \n  \n \nCapital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\n \n \n Trudeau's close ally and longtime friend Dominic LeBlanc becomes public safety, democratic institutions, and intergovernmental affairs minister, seeing him maintain his relationships with the provinces and the ongoing foreign interference public inquiry negotiations, while adding in responsibility for key gun control legislation and RCMP reform. \n \n In a move many predicted, Pablo Rodriguez becomes transport minister tasked with ensuring Canadian travellers are well-treated by Canadian air and rail services, while maintaining the Quebec lieutenant role, while Pascale St-Onge takes over the minister of Canadian heritage portfolio.\n \n This will make the first out lesbian in cabinet Trudeau's new lead on some hot online platform policies, including the ongoing debacle over implementing online news regulations following the passage of Bill C-18. Heritage is a file sources close to St-Onge have said she's interested in and fits as a next step following her time overseeing the sport portfolio.\n \n \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is applauded at a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld\n \n Jean-Yves Duclos becomes minister of public services and procurement, a move he said he didn't see as a demotion after helping navigate the last few post-COVID-19 years.\n \n I am an economist by training... we want to focus very much on the cost of living, helping Canadians put food on the table, also helping grow the economy. And in my new role, I will have many tools to do that,\" he said. \n \n Taking over the health file is outgoing House leader Mark Holland. Karina Gould is the new leader of the government in the House of Commons, poised to lead the Liberals in the Chamber, a key role during question period.\n \n Trudeau announced that when Gould takes parental leave this winter, given she's expecting her second child, Chief Government Whip Steven MacKinnon will take over as House leader until she returns, and current deputy whip Ruby Sahota will fill in for MacKinnon.\n \n Jonathan Wilkinson is now Canada's minister of energy but maintains the natural resources portion of his title. Similarly, Seamus O’Regan maintains his minister of labour role, but has been given the additional responsibility of minister of seniors.\n \n As for other Atlantic Canadians given new roles: Gudie Hutchings holds her role as minister of rural economic development, while adding in responsibility for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Lawrence MacAulay becomes agriculture and agri-food minister, and Ginette Petitpas Taylor takes over for MacAulay as veterans affairs minister and associate minister of national defence.\n \n  \n \nIn pictures: \nMajor Trudeau cabinet shuffle\n \n \n Harjit Sajjan becomes King's Privy Council president and the minister of emergency preparedness, where his past military experience will be tapped into as Canada continues to evolve its natural disaster response plans and respond to a devastating wildfire season. He also becomes the minister responsible for the Pacific Economic Development Agency of Canada.\n \n Fellow B.C. minister and Paralympian Carla Qualtrough becomes minister of sport and physical activity, picking back up a file she's previously held.\n \n Close Trudeau ally Marc Miller becomes minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, after years spent building relationships with Indigenous communities. Ahmed Hussen has been dropped from housing and becomes minister of international development. Picking up the diversity, inclusion, and persons with disabilities files is Kamal Khera.\n \n A few other ministers who have held their roles over successive previous shuffles are also on the move: Marie-Claude Bibeau becomes Canada's minister of national revenue, aka the minister responsible for the Canada Revenue Agency.\n \n And, former CRA minister Diane Lebouthillier is now the minister of fisheries, oceans and the Canadian coast guard. Should there be further findings regarding the ill-fated Titan submersible, expect this francophone minister to front those questions.\n \n SEVEN ROOKIES IN, SEVEN MINISTERS OUT\n \n As senior government sources confirmed ahead of Wednesday's shuffle, seven ministers are out of cabinet: Omar Alghabra, Joyce Murray, Helena Jaczek, Carolyn Bennett, Marco Mendicino, David Lametti, and Mona Fortier.\n \n These departures have paved the way for the prime minister to promote several backbench Liberal MPs from key battleground ridings in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia.\n \n \nMississauga-Streetsville MP Rechie Valdez arrives for a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Wednesday, July 26, 202. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n \n The seven rookie MPs who have clinched cabinet posts are\n \n  \n Scarborough-Rouge Park, Ont. MP Gary Anandasangaree, who becomes minister of Crown-Indigenous relations after serving as a parliamentary secretary and a Liberal MP since 2015;\n  \n Parkdale-High Park, Ont. MP Arif Virani, who was first elected in 2015, and now has a major new role: Canada's minister of justice and attorney general, picking up several bills left by Lametti before the House;\n  \n Burnaby North-Seymour, B.C. MP Terry Beech, who has also been in the House since 2015, now gets a brand new title, becoming the minister of citizens' services;\n  \n Hochelaga, Que. MP Soraya Martinez Ferrada, becomes minister of tourism and is responsible for the Quebec economic development agency. She was first elected in 2019;\n  \n York Centre, Ont. MP Ya'ara Saks, first elected in a 2020 byelection becomes minister of mental health and addictions, holding on to a role held by a nearby former minister Bennett;\n  \n Kanata-Carleton, Ont. MP Jenna Sudds, first elected in 2021 becomes minister of families, children and social development, picking up the Ottawa-area vacancy left by Fortier's cabinet departure; and\n  \n Mississauga-Streetsville, Ont. MP Rechie Valdez, first elected in 2021 as Canada's first Filipina MP, becomes minister of small business.\n \n \n \"It just really demonstrates that decoupling small business from the larger portfolio shows the importance, and I've been advocating it, for it since I began as an MP, Valdez said to reporters after becoming emotional during her oath-swearing. \"It's incredibly important that we focus on the small businesses, because they are the backbone of our economy and I truly believe that, being that I was a small business entrepreneur myself.\" \n \n While four of the outgoing ministers have announced they aren't running again, Fortier and Mendicino confirmed Wednesday they \ndo plan to seek re-election\n. In his statement, Lametti \ndidn't touch on that question. \n \n Asked by reporters why he chose to remove those three, Trudeau was unspecific, beyond saying it was about \"putting forward the strongest possible team, with fresh energy, and a range of skills.\" \n \n  \n \nMeet the 7 rookie MPs joining Justin Trudeau's cabinet\n \n \n \nIn a statement posted to social media\n Wednesday morning, Mendicino—who was at the centre of shuffle chatter over his handling of hot files—said it had been \"an honour\" to serve as a minister in the immigration and public safety portfolios for nearly four years, and said he plans to stick around as the Liberal MP for Eglinton-Lawrence, Ont.\n \n \"Those who know me well know that politics is in my blood… I have every intention of continuing to serve for the remainder of this mandate, and into the next election,\" Mendicino said.\n \n \"To my cabinet and caucus colleagues, it remains a privilege to work with you. The seating arrangements may move around in the House of Commons from time to time, but we are family and committed to the same cause.\"\n \n In his lengthy public comment, Lametti called his time as justice minister the privilege of his life, congratulated two of his former parliamentary secretaries for their promotions, and reflected on his accomplishments from passing a conversion therapy ban, to tabling a new process for wrongful convictions. \n \n JUST 8 MINISTERS MAINTAIN ROLES\n \n A sign of just how seismic Trudeau's cabinet reconfiguration is, only eight ministers were left untouched:\n \n \nFrancois-Philippe Champagne, left to right, Chrystia Freeland and Mary Ng arrive for a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n \n  \n Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland;\n  \n Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Francois-Philippe Champagne;\n  \n Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly;\n  \n Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault;\n  \n Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu;\n  \n Women and Gender Equality and Youth Minister Marci Ien;\n  \n Minister of Northern Affairs Dan Vandal, who also oversees Prairie economic development; and\n  \n Minister Filomena Tassi who is responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario.\n \n \n Trudeau defended his decision to keep these ministers in their current roles, particularly Freeland, at a time where Canadians continue to feel the pinch of inflation and are uncertain about the country's economic trajectory.\n \n \"We need to continue to put our very best foot forward and work even harder,\" he said, adding that he's \"so proud\" to continue this work alongside his deputy prime minister.\n \n \"We're bolstering that economic team with the likes of Jean-Yves Duclos, Sean Fraser, Anita Anand and others that are going to continue to step up and make sure Canadians know that we've got their backs, but we've also got them into the kind of ambitious and optimistic future I know Canadians want, and that is a clear contrast from the 'brokenness' philosophy that the leader of the Conservative Party continues to put forward,\" Trudeau said. \n \n Trudeau's entire top tier was invited to attend the ceremony at the governor general's residence, regardless of if they were on the move or not. Also there to watch were some of Trudeau's top PMO staffers, Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Wayne Eyre, and a number of ministers' aides. The shuffle is now likely to also trigger a considerable staffing shakeup.  \n \n WHY SHUFFLE NOW?\n \n A senior government source told CTV News that Trudeau and his inner circle have looked at this shuffle as \"fortifying\" the prime minister's economic team around issues such as housing affordability and the clean energy transition, to present a clear contrast to their main Conservative opponents when it comes to how they view and communicate on these issues.\n \n It's also been widely discussed that elevating high-performers into key posts today may help the Liberals, after eight years in power, present a refreshed face to make the case to the Canadian public that they're re-electable.\n \n \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau arrives for a cabinet swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n \n Wednesday's changes have not changed the size of the cabinet, with 38 members—19 men and 19 women— in the gender-balanced cabinet, not counting the prime minister. Maintaining gender parity is a standard Trudeau set when his first cabinet was sworn-in in 2015.\n \n This shakeup is the first major change since the Liberals' 2021 election win, and the prime minister is hoping with these changes to lock in the team he will lead into the next election, currently slated for 2025.\n \n Asked Wednesday whether he could commit to not pulling the plug on the current minority Parliament and launching the country into an early election, Trudeau was not absolute, but said they still have \"so much work to do over the coming years.\"\n \n With all parties continuing to prepare for the next election, the opposition is already signalling that these changes aren't going to be enough to turn around slipping Liberal polling numbers.\n \n From Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre stating Trudeau should be the one getting a new job, to NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, and Green Party Deputy Leader Jonathan Pedneault all noting several problem files remain, the reset team has their work cut out for them.\n \n \"Despite the appearance of a new beginning, this government is poised to continue in the same direction at a time when the problems facing Canadians warrant foundational changes to our economy, our politics and our federation,\" Pedneault said in a statement. \"Just like Pierre Poilievre taking off his glasses, Justin Trudeau's cabinet reshuffle has more to do with cosmetics than politics.\" \n \n Last on the itinerary for the new cabinet on their big day, was a 4 p.m. EDT meeting in West Block.\n \n Holding cabinet meetings shortly after a shuffle is something Trudeau has done in the past, with analysts suggesting it's an effort to signal that the team is rolling up their sleeves and getting to work right away.\n \n Trudeau's office confirmed Wednesday that \"in the coming weeks\" changes will be announced to the makeup of cabinet committees, and the membership of a new \"National Security Council\" that is being billed as \"a new forum for ministers to deliberate on and address issues of pressing concern to Canada's domestic and international security.\"\n \n Then, it'll be on the new ministry to get down to work on the refocused promises Trudeau mandates them to prioritize, a prepare for the September return of Parliament. \n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The cone represents the area through which the storm will take a probable path. The risk of stormy weather for the Maritimes continues to be Saturday and Sunday.\n \n \nHurricane Lee maintains a Category 3 storm Tuesday afternoon.\n \n Due to the increased amount of uncertainty that far into the forecast for the storm, it should be noted that the cone is quite wide, measuring over 700 km in width.\n \n In their \nfirst bulletin on Lee\n, the Canadian Hurricane Centre stated that “The range of track possibilities is very broad this far ahead in time, ranging from somewhere in Maine to the southeast of Nova Scotia.” The extent the centre of the storm moves through that area will determine what areas experience the worst of the weather with the storm.\n \n For example, a pass more towards the west, into Maine, would direct the strongest of the winds Saturday into coastal Maine and the heaviest of the rain through that state and into eastern areas of Quebec. A pass of the centre of the storm into southwestern Nova Scotia would bring the most intense wind into western areas of that province and southern New Brunswick Saturday, with the heaviest rain occurring in southwestern Nova Scotia and extending into New Brunswick. A more precise path through the area will continue to be narrowed down over the coming days.\n \n \nThe latest forecast track from the National Hurricane Center has Lee approaching the Maritimes as a Category 1 hurricane Saturday morning.\n \n On the plus side, as Lee moves west of Bermuda it is expected to encounter a pool of relatively cooler water that was left in the wake of the passage of Hurricane Franklin last week. That, combined with some unfavourable wind conditions, is expected to decrease the intensity of the storm with it approaching as a Category 1 hurricane – making the storm weaker than both Fiona and Dorian, which arrived as equivalent Category 2.\n \n \nA pool of ocean water less than 26.5 degrees Celsius is present just west of Bermuda due to the passage of Hurricane Franklin. As Lee moves over that water it should work to weaken the storm.\n \n Just because the storm may not be as intense as Fiona and Dorian, that doesn’t mean it won’t be impactful. While the intensity in the forecast may decrease, the size of the storm will actually increase. The wind and rain will diffuse outwards from the centre to encompass a very large area. The wind will still be strong enough to bring a high risk of power outages to the Maritimes. Areas that get into the heaviest rain will still have a risk of flooding and flash flooding. A rough and pounding surf will be present on parts of the coast. Travel services, such as ferries, may still be disrupted.\n \n Additionally whether it moves more towards Maine or more directly into the Maritimes, the storm will be slow to clear the region.

That is step up for families and communities and help with the high costs of living, as we're building a stronger future.\"\n \n On Wednesday, Trudeau promoted seven rookies to his front bench, dropped seven ministers, and \nreassigned the majority of cabinet roles\n, in a sizeable shakeup meant to refresh and reset the minority government's agenda.\n \n The shuffle was in part to enhance the cabinet's economic policy team, seeing a few ministers reassigned to fiscal files including Anita Anand overseeing the Treasury Board, and rookie Rechie Valdez taking on the small business portfolio.\n \n \"We've strengthen our economic portfolios, we're focused on building the kind of economic support now and strong plan for the future that Canadians deserve,\" said Trudeau.\n \n  \n \nTop headlines on Canadian politics, all in one place\n \n \n “The choice Canadians are increasingly facing in politics is between a responsible, ambitious, forward-thinking government that is preparing for the opportunities of the future, and a party that is stoking anger and fear,\" Trudeau said, repeating a line of attack he's levelled against Poilievre, and his predecessors before.\n \n \"Throwing up its hands saying 'everything is broken, I’ll reflect the anxiety everyone's feeling into anger, won't provide any solutions, but we’ll all get mad as hell together.' That’s not how you build a country,\" Trudeau went on.\n \n In a post-shuffle press conference Poilievre was quick to signal Trudeau’s cabinet overhaul was an admission that \"his government is broken.\" The Conservative leader said the shakeup was little more than a sign that the Liberals are in electoral trouble, and title changes wouldn't be enough to turn around slipping Liberal polling numbers.\n \n \"I think what Trudeau is trying to do is more optics and political, and is trying to cover up the disastrous policies that are that are dragging his government down,\" said Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer in an interview on the Vassy Kapelos Show.\n \n \"We're going through a cost of living crisis, interest rates have risen faster… it's causing abject misery for Canadians who are now having to re-mortgage their house.\"\n \n HOUSING TO BE 'COMPLETE PRIORITY'\n \n \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and then-immigration minister Sean Fraser chat with customers at The Barn Cafe and Social House in Bridgewater, N.S., Tuesday, March 14, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Riley Smith\n \n Housing was another key change made as part of Wednesday's shuffle. Trudeau moved Nova Scotia MP and former immigration minister Sean Fraser into a reconstituted housing portfolio, pledging a refreshed approach.\n \n Speaking with CTV News' Chief Political Correspondent Vassy Kapelos, the new minister of housing, infrastructure and communities said it's an \"unequivocal yes\" that addressing issues related to the housing sector is going to be a bigger priority for the federal government going forward.\n \n  \n \nTop real estate headlines, all in one place\n \n \n \"Housing and infrastructure for that matter, are in need of attention because Canadians are facing very real challenges as a result of the pressures on the housing sector… We need to accelerate the work that we've been doing,\" said Fraser.\n \n \"I know that we've got the buy-in of the entire government to treat housing as a complete priority, in order to address one of the biggest bottlenecks to economic growth, which is making sure people can find a place to call home and work and live in the communities that they choose.\"\n \n Combining the infrastructure and housing files at a time where there's a need for cross-jurisdictional collaboration on building more houses, was intentional, Fraser suggested.\n \n \"We want to put more resources into the system to build more quickly… We're going to work very closely with municipal governments and with communities across the country, to make sure that we're putting the tools in place that allow them to build as quickly as possible,\" said the minister. \"I'm not interested in further delaying any measures that are going to put a roof over the homes of Canadians.\"\n \n  \n \nThe Offer newsletter: Sign up for complete coverage of Canadian real estate news\n \n \n Trudeau picking a minister that has been able to handle \npolitical and public pressure\n to make quick progress in the past, was likely also a factor at play in Fraser's new appointment.\n \n The Conservatives have been focusing on housing as a central political issue, and—despite Poilievre recently having to apologize to a tenant for describing the place she \ncalls home a \"tiny little shack\"\n—he's managed to gain traction his pledge to \"fire gatekeepers\" to \"build homes fast,\" for young first-time homebuyers.\n \n Asked what he made of Fraser's appointment, Scheer said he hopes he can do better than the backlogs he oversaw at immigration, but with \"a heck of a lot of work to do,\" he \"doesn't have any faith.\"\n \n The former party leader was also asked what he thinks the Conservative homebuilding plan would accomplish. In contrast to the Liberal approach, Scheer didn't offer a target number of how many new houses they'd aim to build.\n \n \"The wonderful thing about the free market is that when you remove government barriers and you remove the gatekeepers and simplify processes, it's not up to the government itself to actually do it, because the free market does it for society,\" Scheer said.\n \n \"I can assure you that that with our plan to unleash the power of the free market, to get local government out of the way, make sure that they're there to assist new homes coming on the market, not act as gatekeepers, that will absolutely result in more supply.\"\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The rationale was if twenty tents were set up on the commons—and more added once baseball season was over—it would relieve some of the pressure on already existing overcrowded encampments, including Victoria Park and Grande Parade.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a 12-4 vote, HRM council voted against it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"What this means to my residents today and the businesses in downtown today is nothing changes tomorrow. It will exactly the same out there in Victoria Park and we've given no clear direction to staff,\" said councillor Waye Mason.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Do I love using the Commons as a tent location? No. I don’t think anyone thinks that’s a great idea,” said councillor Sam Austin. “But I think we’re in this place of what is the alternative? Is the alternative to wait until Victoria Park has 70, 80 tents in it? Is that what we’re going to do?”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMax Chauvin, the report’s author and the HRM’s director of housing and homelessness, explained the number of homeless people in Halifax has dramatically jumped from 18 unhoused people five years ago to 178 this summer.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe pointed out tent sites are overcrowding and it’s expected more people will be living on the streets next year, as Nova Scotia’s rent cap increases to 5 per cent in January and the population continues to grow.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We are in an immediate crisis and we need immediate solutions,” he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHis staff report on homelessness said without dramatic policy changes from other all orders of government around creating deeply affordable housing, the city must accept that hundreds of people sheltering outside will continue for several years to come and plan according.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I don’t think in the seven years I’ve been in council I’ve ever been more sobered by a staff report,” said Shawn Cleary, councillor for District 9.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFrustrations were on full display at the start of the debate Tuesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile Chauvin pointed out to HRM council, the province of Nova Scotia added 64 beds to the shelter system and opened 304 new supportive housing units in the past year, several councillors blamed the province for a lack of action on homelessness. The report also mentions that staff asked the province and Ottawa for additional space for unhoused people to shelter and while the province initially offered multiple sites to consider, none were made available.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“The province is not doing their job and are giving them a way to keep from doing their job,” said councillor Tim Outhit, while debating the options presented to council. “Instead of sending them down on the Commons, send them down to the legislature.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSam Austin said people are being forced to live outside because of a complete dereliction of duty by the province.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“If you look at the choices that our current government has made they do not lend anyone to think the cavalry is coming,” said Austin.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“You look at the contrast. Out in Tantallon where we have a wildfire within a month you have a plan to bring in the housing. How long have we been asking for help pleading with our provincial government for some action on this? It’s going on three years now.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCouncillor Lisa Blackburn fears after the rent cap rises, the housing crisis could become a humanitarian crisis.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Because you know that those rents are going up 5 per cent to the absolute penny,” said Blackburn.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Tuesday night HRM council also voted for staff to look into buying pre-made structures, explore leasing private land to house people, and write the province to ask for their immediate plans to create deeply affordable housing in HRM.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nFor more Nova Scotia news visit our dedicated \nprovincial page\n.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The population increased by 38,000 people from January 2022 to January 2023, the minister said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMacMaster said economic pressures caused by inflation saw spending increase to $15.5 billion, a figure that includes a record $1.7 billion in additional spending. The extra spending, known as additional appropriations, is money approved by cabinet, not the legislature, and that wasn't included in the budget.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMacMaster made no apologies for the extra spending, which escaped scrutiny by the opposition parties.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Despite our best efforts we were not able to predict the amounts of revenues that came into the province,\" he said. \"They were spent on targeted support for people most in need and on things like housing. It allowed us to do some of those things more quickly.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMost of the 1.7 billion was spent during the spring, and went to economic support programs, along with student loans and bursaries. About $68 million was allocated for future obligations for such things as aging government buildings that may need to be cleared of asbestos. About $4.3 million was spent on post-tropical storm Fiona cleanup costs and relief programs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLiberal Leader Zach Churchill said that with the better-than-expected financial situation the government should consider giving Nova Scotians an income tax cut to help them deal with the cost of living.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"This would also be a good time to increase the rates for income assistance ... to at least keep pace with inflation,\" Churchill said, noting that those rates have remained frozen for the last two years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNDP Leader Claudia Chender was critical of the size of the extra appropriations and said more of that type of spending should be subject to legislative oversight. One way to do that, she said, is to make the House of Assembly sit for longer than it currently does.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think that they (government) want to do whatever they want with the money that they get ΓÇª and they don't want to have to answer for it,\" Chender said. \"Nova Scotians should be very concerned about that.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMeanwhile, the province's net debt stood at $17.8 billion at the end of the fiscal year. Finance Department officials said the surplus for 2022-23 would go toward the debt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2023.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nFor more Nova Scotia news visit our dedicated \nprovincial page\n.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

This has to change.\"'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHis email noted, the \"the sexual-assault hearing process for the student's case ... isn't overseen by a single person who is a qualified psychologist, psychiatrist or counsellor or has any extensive experience with such hearings.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWithin weeks, the woman -- whose name cannot be published due to a court publication ban -- had teamed with Gibson and several other students and former students to plan an online campaign titled SA Change Now.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLaunched on Sept. 1, it includes vignettes describing allegations of sexual assault and misconduct at the province's only francophone university.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSome advocates involved in the campaign's launch say it's the latest example of how a Me Too movement -- where survivors tell their stories and lead the calls for reformed sexual assault policies -- can force change on a small campus.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe site states there have been \"at least 53 sexual assaults either on Universite Sainte-Anne campus or involving students from the university\" between 2015 and 2019. The school had approximately 350 full-time students per year during that time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWithin days of the site's appearance, the RCMP made a public appeal for any information related to alleged sexual assaults at the school.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Tuesday, RCMP spokesman Cpl. Chris Marshall said in an interview that in recent years, four alleged sexual assaults at the university were investigated. However, he said local police are now also \"aware\" of the fresh allegations and -- while survivors haven't directly contacted the force -- investigators have received information on several of the cases.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"This is the first instance (in the past three years) that I've seen where an online campaign led directly to any kind of an investigation or file being opened,\" he said. \"These movements give survivors the courage and the confidence to finally come forward to tell their story and to bring them to the police.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe school said in an email to The Canadian Press last Friday that it is working on responding to calls for reform, including improved lighting on campus and the hiring of an on-site counsellor for assault victims. It said it is also looking at having an independent review of its hearing process.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut the SA Change Now campaign is also calling for an apology from the administration, an office dedicated to the complaints and the inclusion of qualified professionals in hearings held to sanction students for misconduct. It's also demanding that the school set deadlines to make the reforms and stick to them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe school's director of communications did not respond on Tuesday to requests for further comment.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJoanna Clark, a graduate of the education program, said in an interview Monday she recalled bringing forward complaints as a student leader to the administration and feeling there was little impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis time, she's more hopeful. \"It was time to remove the curtain ... It's not hidden anymore,\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe young woman whose story became the catalyst for the website said she feels a mixture of relief and continuing stress as she relives her own story. \"I've kind of channelled my anger into this campaign,\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe said in 2021 she was sexually assaulted by a male student at a secluded area near the campus. The prosecutor dropped charges last April, saying there was \"no realistic prospect of conviction.\" However, the court approved a one-year peace bond requiring the young man to stay away from the woman.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe said that during the legal process she was \"ostracized, shamed and bullied\" by people on and off campus for pressing her case. In the spring of 2022, she took time off school for mental health care and was placed on a suicide watch amid a diagnosis of PTSD.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe young woman said she continued with the internal university process after criminal charges were dropped but said she felt it was poorly conducted. She said the people leading the process -- two students, an administrator and an academic supervisor -- lacked training on dealing with sexual assault survivors. She was also concerned about legal costs, as she needed a lawyer.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSo she ended her complaint in early 2023. \"I had six courses to work on and it was all retraumatizing .... Meanwhile, they let him (the student she launched the complaint against) graduate. There was nothing I could do anyway,\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGibson, Clark and the young woman say they're hoping the police investigation and their campaign bring results and change soon.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut as they await more information on the response, Gibson said he's found the process of going public was the \"only\" and best choice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It was by talking to more students I started to realize, 'Holy mother of God, this is really, really bad,\"' he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 13, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

We're still very much in the red in this in this budget,\" Fred O'Riordon, the national leader for tax policy at EY, told CTV News.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAFFORDABILITY AND HEALTH MEASURES, TRAVELLER FEE\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs signalled ahead of the budget's release, the federal government is introducing a one-time “grocery rebate” that will cost $2.5 billion to help 11 million low- and modest-income Canadians pay their bills.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNot required to be spent at the grocery store, the rebate is being offered through the GST tax credit system and would see eligible couples with two children receive a payment of up to $467. A senior would receive $225, while a single person would receive $234.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe budget also includes the federal government's commitment to spend $46.2 billion more than previously earmarked for health care, as agreed to through deals with the provinces and territories in exchange for marked improvements to patient care and access.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMeeting a prescribed need per the Liberal-NDP confidence and supply agreement— albeit now with a higher price tag than initially billed—the budget includes $13 billion over five years and $4.4 billion ongoing to implement the more formalized \"Canadian Dental Care Plan\" to see eligibility expanded beyond children under age 12.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\t\r\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tConnected to expanding coverage, the government also plans to spend $250 million over three years setting up an \"Oral Health Access Fund\" to address gaps in access for vulnerable populations and those living in rural and remote communities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA few other health-focused measures are being highlighted in this budget, including:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t$45.9 million over four years to expand a budget 2022 initiative that offered a 50 per cent increase to the maximum loan forgiveness on Canada Student Loans for doctors and nurses working in underserved rural or remote communities;\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t$158.4 million over three years to support the implementation and operation of the new 988 suicide prevention hotline championed by a Conservative MP; and\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t$359.2 million over five years to combat the opioid crisis by renewing Canada's drug and substances strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the budget, the Liberals point to a suite of new air traveller-focused measures, including moving ahead with strengthening airline compensation obligations, and providing the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) $1.8B over five years to speed up processing times and strengthen security measures.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHowever, buried in the supplementary tax information, it appears that travellers are going to be paying for it through an increase to the Air Travellers Security Charge. For example, air passengers on a roundtrip domestic flight will pay $19.87, up from the current $14.96, and on international flights the rate will rise from $25.91 to $34.42. This security charge last increased in 2010.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOf note, the word \"pharmacare\" does not appear once in the document, and there's little new in this budget when it comes to new housing measures, beyond mentioning existing or ongoing efforts, and allocating $4 billion more for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation \"to implement a co-developed Urban, Rural, and Northern Indigenous Housing Strategy.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRELIEF THROUGH TAX AND POLICY CHANGES\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWithout further dipping into taxpayers' pockets to fund cost-of-living relief measures, the 2023 federal budget puts forward a number of policy and tax-tinkering efforts aimed at offering Canadians and businesses relief in other ways.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis includes cracking down on hidden or unexpected consumer fees known as \"junk fees\" that inflate the overall cost of a product or service, in partnership with regulators and provincial governments. Through this the Liberals say they will be going after telecom roaming charges, event and concert fees, excessive baggage fees, and unjustified shipping fees.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a win for the beer, wine, and spirits lobby, the Liberals are moving to temporarily cap the planned April 1 increase to the excise duty on alcohol at two per cent, instead of the scheduled six per cent rise. This move will remain in effect for one year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe federal government says it will also be amending the Criminal Code to stamp out predatory lending that targets Canadians in perilous financial situations with high interest rate loans, by lowering the amount of interest that can legally be charged, to 35 per cent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor small businesses, this budget announces that after some work, the federal government has secured deals with Visa and MasterCard to lower credit card transaction fees, resulting in more than 90 per cent of businesses who accept credit cards seeing their interchange fees reduced by up to 27 per cent. This move is expected to save eligible mom-and-pop shops approximately $1 billion over five years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThere are a few policy changes aimed at students as well, including raising the interest-free Canada Student Loan limit from $210 to $300 per week of study and waiving the requirement for mature students to undergo credit screening to qualify for federal student loans and grants.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a pair of moves that so far have no price tag but are meant to make everyday living a little easier, the budget also includes:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tA policy pledge to instill \"a right to repair,\" making it more affordable for Canadians to repair rather than replace their home appliances and electronics; and\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tPlans to explore imposing a standard USB charging port for cell phones, laptops and other electronic devices.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCLEAN ECONOMY AND BUSINESS INCENTIVES\n\r\n\n\r\n\tArguably the centrepiece in Tuesday's budget was the chapter on spurring economic growth in Canada's clean energy sectors, through investment tax credits, low-cost strategic financing, and targeted programs to spur growth in critical minerals and other key sectors such as electric vehicles.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis portion of the federal spending plan includes:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tA refundable 15 per cent clean electricity investment tax credit for investments in non-emitting electricity generation systems, and electricity storage or transmission, at a cost of $6.3 billion over 4 years;\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tA refundable clean technology manufacturing tax credit equal to 30 per cent of the cost of investments in machinery used to manufacture or process clean technologies, at a cost of $4.5 billion over five years;\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tA clean hydrogen investment tax credit first signalled in the 2022 fall update, with support ranging from 15 to 40 per cent of eligible project costs; and\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tAt least $20 billion coming from the Canada Infrastructure Bank to support building major clean electricity and clean growth infrastructure projects.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"In the months and years to come, we must seize the remarkable opportunities for Canada that are presented by two fundamental shifts in the global economy: the race to build the clean economies of the 21st century, and our allies’ accelerating efforts to friendshore their economies by building their critical supply chains through democracies like our own,\" reads Freeland's foreword.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking with reporters, Freeland said the federal government views its approach to climate change and clean growth as a pyramid, with the price on carbon at the base, followed by the new tax incentives, concessional financing, and \"bespoke\" support for certain projects at the peak.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOverall, the government is expected to spend $80 billion over the next decade on clean economy-focused initiatives.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPROTECTING DIASPORA COMMUNITIES, ATHLETES\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe budget also includes some smaller-ticket items indicating the Liberals are seeking to address some of the pressing stories that have been top of mind for Canadians since the last budget: foreign interference, abuse in sport, and a rise in online hate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOver the next three years, the Liberals are planning to spend $48.9 million on protecting diaspora communities as well as Canadians from attempts by foreign states to interfere, threaten, and covertly influence individuals or institutions.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis money will be going to the RCMP to bolster its protections for those who face harassment and intimidation, increase its investigative capacity, and more proactively engage with targeted communities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAn additional $13.5 million will be spent over five years and then $3.1 million in following years to see Public Safety Canada establish a \"National Counter-Foreign Interference Office.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe budget also promises $13.8 million for the Department of Canadian Heritage to ensure that Canadian sporting institutions are accountable for athletes' treatment and to support a sport system that promotes safety and well-being.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile online harms legislation is still being drafted, the Liberals will be rolling out a new \"Action Plan to Combat Hate\" that is coming with a $49.5 million boost to Public Safety Canada's coffers to allow it to expand its ability to respond to \"the evolving security needs of communities.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFINDING SAVINGS, FISCAL ANCHOR\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\t\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in

of the spending, the 2023 federal budget includes new ways the government is looking to cut back and generate revenue.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis includes \"refocusing government spending\" by reducing spending on consulting, professional services and travel by 15 per cent, resulting in $7.1 billion in savings over five years, starting in 2023-24 and then $1.7 billion ongoing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFurther, the budget proposes a three per cent reduction in spending by departments and agencies by 2026-27, bringing in an estimated $7 billion in unused federal funds.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Liberals are pledging that this tightening of federal purse strings will not impact service delivery to Canadians nor the Canadian Armed Forces, though Crown corporations are being asked to seek similar spending reductions which the Liberals estimate could see $1.5 billion in savings.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn total, these measures are set to save $15.4 billion over the next five years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGoing after wealthier taxpayers in a move that will generate $3 billion in revenues over five years starting in 2024, the Liberals will be making legislative changes to raise the alternative minimum tax, or AMT rate, from 15 per cent to 20.5 per cent and \"further limit the excessive use of tax preferences.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn addition to the new announcements, the massive economic document also offers an updated full picture of the state of the country’s finances that paints a less rosy picture than the fall economic statement, closer to the downside projections offered in November 2022.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile the economy is slowing, resulting in less GDP growth, the government is projecting a soft economic landing with a strong labour market and 830,000 more Canadians employed than before the pandemic.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFreeland said Tuesday that Canada's debt-to-GDP ration is still the lowest in the G7.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCanada’s debt as a percentage of the GDP is projected at 42.4 in 2022-23, up from the fall fiscal update figure, and it's set to further rise, hovering around 43 per cent over the next two fiscal years before declining.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe country's overall debt is set to rise to $1.31 trillion over the next five years, and with continued high interest rates, the federal government is projected to pay $43.9 billion next year just servicing Canada's debt. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tOPPOSITION PARTIES, STAKEHOLDERS REACT\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs is the case in the immediate aftermath of any budget being tabled, the reaction was swift on Tuesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Parliament Hill, opposition parties offered their perspectives on what Freeland has presented.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I'm really proud that we were able to force this government to expand dental care, that's going to save money for families… It's the biggest expansion of our health-care system in a generation,\" said NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. \"We're also proud that we forced this government to save people money, put more money back in their pockets with the GST rebate… And... for the first time ever we’re able to connect government investments to good wages.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAhead of the budget, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre had wanted the budget to cut taxes and spending, but after seeing what's been presented, he said his caucus will be voting against the \"bonanza\" of new \"inflationary spending.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Today's budget… is a full-frontal attack on the paycheques of hardworking Canadians,\" Poilievre said. \"They have poured fuel on the inflationary fire. Low income, working-class people will suffer the most as a result of this costly, inflationary Liberal deficit.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThrough statements and releases that poured into reporters' inboxes, industry groups offered their takes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Canadian Labour Congress said that the budget includes progress for workers and follows through on key commitments to the NDP, but \"only scratches the surface\" of other pressing crises.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The government's move to attach strings to tax credits to ensure that investments in clean energy create good jobs is positive,\" said president of the Canadian Labour Congress Bea Bruske. \"The affordability crisis means public programs like universal pharmacare and EI are more critical than ever. It is disappointing that the federal government continues to resist calls to implement a full pharmacare program and fix our inadequate EI system.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) said the budget missed a chance to address post-pandemic small business debt and cost pressures, though the credit card fee reduction was a win.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"While CFIB is pleased that the government is capping the hike in excise duties on beer (and) spirits … we will continue to press government to end these automatic tax increases. Sadly, the government missed another opportunity to freeze the upcoming carbon tax hike on April 1, putting further cost pressures on small firms,\" CFIB president Kelly said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnd, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce sent a clear warning shot with its statement, saying plainly that it \"won't close\" Canada's economic growth gap.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Today was an opportunity to lay out a clear plan for growth. While there are some positives, we still lack a coordinated strategy to generate that economic growth over the long term,” said the Chamber's president and CEO, Perrin Beatty. \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The former Toronto mayor led a report in 2015 that instead called for additional lands to be added to the Greenbelt. Crombie says the province's argument that the lands are needed to match an unprecedented need for housing is unfounded.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's a total, total fiction,\" Crombie tells CTV News.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCrombie says that the focus should be on ensuring the Greenbelt meets the people's needs, not the government's. He was appointed to lead that 2015 Greenbelt report by former Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, who herself was in attendance to give support to those outraged by the controversy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The fact that in an area that has supported the Conservatives for many, many years, we've got people coming out to say this is wrong,\" said Wynne. \"I think it's really important, and the government needs to pay attention.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe controversy has been a lingering issue for the Ford government. Earlier this month, former Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clarke resigned following two bombshell reports into the scandal, one from the integrity commissioner and another from the ethics commissioner.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMPP Paul Calandra has been appointed Clarke's replacement and has said in recent days the province will be reviewing all Greenbelt land, a process that could see more land removed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile the issue shows no signs of slowing down, Crombie argues the Ford government can bring a solution in relatively short order and predicts that they will.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think everybody's mother taught them that it's never too late to do the right thing, and if the government could do that, they could do it easily,\" said Crombie. \"All they need to do is put the land back that they said they wanted to take out.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCTV News reached out to the provincial government for its reaction to Tuesday's event by the Simcoe County Greenbelt Coalition but has not yet heard back.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The auto industry accounts for about 3% of the nation's economic output. A prolonged strike could also lead eventually to higher vehicle prices.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop headlines on electric vehicles, and all the latest automotive news \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn an interview with The Associated Press, Fain left open the possibility of avoiding a strike. He acknowledged, more explicitly than he has before, that the union will have to give up some of its demands to reach agreements. Contracts with the three companies will all expire at 11:59 p.m. Sept. 14.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There's a lot of back and forth in bargaining,\" he said, \"and naturally, when you go into bargaining, you don't always get everything you demand. Our workers have high expectations. We made a lot of sacrifices going back to the economic recession.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the interview, Fain did report some progress in the negotiations, saying the union will meet Thursday with GM to hear the company's response to the UAW's economic demands. In addition, discussions are underway with Ford on wages and benefits. Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, has yet to make a counteroffer on wage and benefit demands, he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tStellantis declined to comment Wednesday. GM confirmed that it would meet Thursday with union representatives but wouldn't comment further.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast week, the union filed charges of unfair labour practices against Stellantis and GM, and it said Ford's economic offer fell far short of its demands.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said he thought Fain's latest remarks suggest \"that he is opening up to the realities of bargaining\" as the strike deadline nears.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"As you get close to the deadline,\" Masters said, \"you begin to realize the importance of trying to resolve a problem rather than make a point. Strikes are painful, especially for workers, and also for companies.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFain's willingness to acknowledge publicly that he isn't going to achieve all the union's demands shows there is more flexibility in his approach than previously thought, Masters said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSome signs of movement in the negotiations have emerged, raising the possibility, Masters said, that an agreement might be reached with one automaker that would set the pattern for the others.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think if they can avoid having to go out on strike and the pain that occurs and still get a very good bargain, I think they'll be better off,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe union's demands include 46% across-the-board pay raises, a 32-hour week with 40 hours of pay, restoration of traditional pensions for new hires, union representation of workers at new battery plants and restoration of traditional pensions. Top-scale UAW assembly plant workers make about $32 an hour, plus annual profit-sharing cheques.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn his remarks to the AP, Fain argued that worker pay isn't what has driven up vehicle prices. The average price of a new car has leaped to more than $48,000 on average, in part because of still-scarce supplies resulting from a global shortage of computer chips.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"In the last four years, the price of vehicles went up 30%,\" he said. \"Our wages went up 6%. There were billions of dollars in shareholder dividends. So our wages aren't the problem.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile saying a strike by up to 146,000 members against all three major automakers is a real possibility, Fain said the union doesn't want to strike and would prefer to reach new contracts with them.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Depending on these variables, insurance for EVs can save you a bit of money.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to a 2022 report by auto insurance company \nRatesdotca\n, insurance rates for a 35-year-old man living in Toronto, Ont., with a clean driving record would be cheaper if the driver purchased an electric vehicle versus gasoline.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe average cost for the most expensive EV, a 2017 Tesla Model S, would cost $200.42 per month to insure. The least expensive EV, a 2019 Kia Niro, averages about $165.92 per month to insure.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBy comparison, the most expensive gasoline-powered vehicle to insure, a 2022 BMW M340i, averages roughly $231.75 per month.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop headlines on electric vehicles, and all the latest automotive news \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tQui Trieu, an AVP National Underwriting for Aviva Canada, told CTVNews.ca while there are possibilities for savings, there are still other factors like part replacements that will affect insurance premiums and overall spending costs for an electric vehicle.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the event of an accident and your EV's battery is severely damaged, \nyou could be set back thousands of dollars if your insurance won't cover it.\n However, Trieu says, as the industry grows, so will the accessibility to essential parts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Since EVs are still new to the market, we’re still in the transition period, not only in adoption, but overcoming challenges impacting both the industry and customers related to available vehicle supply and skilled labour. EVs are built differently than gas vehicles and sometimes can be more expensive to repair, which can impact premiums,\" Trieu said in an emailed statement Wednesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWHERE CAN I SAVE ON MONEY?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile there are some savings benefits with overall fuel costs and insurance premiums, the total sole cost of an EV is still fairly expensive in comparison to gas-powered vehicles.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the \nCanadian Automobile Association\n, electric vehicle models from 2022 and 2024 range from $38,198 to $212,500 in price.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe \nfederal government offers a $5,000 purchase incentive for vehicles\n with an electric range over 50 kilometres and $2,500 for plug-in hybrid vehicles with an electric range under 50 kilometres. Additionally, Trieu says drivers should also look into different incentives each province offers and discounts various insurance companies have, which can go a long way in saving money.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWith gas prices soaring in the last year, electric vehicle owners can also save on fuel costs as they no longer have to rely on paying at the pumps if they're able to charge at home or at their nearest charging station.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nDoes buying an electric vehicle make financial sense?\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDepending on the size of the vehicle and the amount of distance you're driving, that will vary the costs to charge an EV. For example, Canada's 2023 Fuel Consumption Guide found the annual charging cost for the owner of a Tesla Model S vehicle is $525 per year. Compared to a Honda Civic, for example, annual fuel costs can reach $1,775.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWHO WOULD BE A GOOD CANDIDATE?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBrian Kingston, president of Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, says Canadians considering the switch to electric need no convincing when it comes to savings, but the lack of charging stations make it difficult to make the plunge.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Survey after survey shows that the biggest concern that Canadians have when it comes to making the switch to an electric vehicle is the ability to charge and the price of these new vehicles,\" Kingston told CTVNews.ca in a phone interview on Wednesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCanadians should consider several factors before purchasing an EV, Kingston explains, but evaluating how accessible charging a vehicle is should be top of mind, whether that's at their home, their workplace, or a nearby charging station.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAdditionally, Kingston says Canadians should look at their driving patterns and consider how often and how far they drive to figure out whether an electric vehicle is right for them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's really important that you look at your driving patterns, and determine if you've got the charging infrastructure to facilitate it. The one unique thing about Canada is that we've got a 1.1 million kilometres of two lane public road, we've got a cold climate and Canadians drive long distances,” he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It's not out of the question for somebody to drive 800 kilometres over a weekend to visit family or go across the province, so if you do that regularly, it's important that you make sure that you've got access to charging infrastructure.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Releasing such information would complicate negotiations with other companies as the government seeks to attract investments in electric car production, she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe government has mandated that only zero-emission cars and vans may be sold in the U.K. by 2035.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"What I will say is that we do provide some subsidy, very light subsidy, in the auto industry because it faces so much difficulty, and some of that is regulatory,\" Badenoch told reporters in Oxford. \"So if we're asking manufacturers to transition to net zero, that creates additional costs which make it a little bit harder, so we do have to factor that in.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of the biggest hurdles facing Britain's auto industry is building factories to make the batteries needed to power the next generation of electric vehicles.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBritish car production slumped 40% from 2019 through 2022 as the industry was hit by Brexit and COVID-19, as well as post-pandemic computer chip shortages and the transition to electric vehicles, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile output has rebounded this year as chip shortages eased, the trade group estimates annual production at about 840,500 vehicles, down from more than 1.3 million in 2019.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Mini project is the latest boost for the U.K. auto industry, with vehicle makers announcing plans to invest more than 6 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) in Britain over the past two years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBMW said it would make electric versions of the Mini Cooper three-door and the compact crossover Mini Aceman at the Oxford plant.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe investment ensures Britain will remain one of the manufacturing hubs for the Mini after previous announcements of projects in China and Germany.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBritish Motor Corp. began making the Mini in Oxford in 1959. The small, two-door car quickly became an icon of the Cool Britannia of the 1960s. It featured in the 1969 heist movie \"The Italian Job\" and its 2003 remake.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBMW acquired the brand in 1994 when it bought Rover Group, the successor to British Motor.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Mini has always been aware of its history -- Oxford is and remains the heart of the brand,\" Stefanie Wurst, the head of the Mini brand, said.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Most major manufacturers admit they may be selling your personal information, a new study finds, with half also saying they would share it with the government or law enforcement without a court order.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe proliferation of sensors in automobiles -- from telematics to fully digitized control consoles -- has made them prodigious data-collection hubs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop headlines on electric vehicles, and all the latest automotive news\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut drivers are given little or no control over the personal data their vehicles collect, researchers for the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation said Wednesday in their latest \"Privacy Not Included\" survey Security standards are also vague, a big concern given automakers' track record of susceptibility to hacking.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Cars seem to have really flown under the privacy radar and I'm really hoping that we can help remedy that because they are truly awful,\" said Jen Caltrider, the study's research lead. \"Cars have microphones and people have all kinds of sensitive conversations in them. Cars have cameras that face inward and outward.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUnless they opt for a used, pre-digital model, car buyers \"just don't have a lot of options,\" Caltrider said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCars scored worst for privacy among more than a dozen product categories -- including fitness trackers, reproductive-health apps, smart speakers and other connected home appliances -- that Mozilla has studied since 2017.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNot one of the 25 car brands whose privacy notices were reviewed -- chosen for their popularity in Europe and North America -- met the minimum privacy standards of Mozilla, which promotes open-source, public interest technologies and maintains the Firefox browser. By contrast, 37% of the mental health apps the non-profit reviewed this year did.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNineteen automakers say they can sell your personal data, their notices reveal. Half will share your information with government or law enforcement in response to a \"request\" -- as opposed to requiring a court order. Only two -- Renault and Dacia, which are not sold in North America -- offer drivers the option to have their data deleted.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Increasingly, most cars are wiretaps on wheels,\" said Albert Fox Cahn, a technology and human rights fellow at Harvard's Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. \"The electronics that drivers pay more and more money to install are collecting more and more data on them and their passengers.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There is something uniquely invasive about transforming the privacy of one's car into a corporate surveillance space,\" he added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA trade group representing the makers of most cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, took issue with that characterization. In a letter sent Tuesday to U.S. House and Senate leadership, it said it shares \"the goal of protecting the privacy of consumers.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt called for a federal privacy law, saying a \"patchwork of state privacy laws creates confusion among consumers about their privacy rights and makes compliance unnecessarily difficult.\" The absence of such a law lets connected devices and smartphones amass data for tailored ad targeting and other marketing -- while also raising the odds of massive information theft through cybersecurity breaches.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nNightly Briefing newsletter: Sign up for an in-depth look at the day’s most compelling news\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Associated Press asked the Alliance, which has resisted efforts to provide car owners and independent repair shops with access to onboard data, if it supports allowing car buyers to automatically opt out of data collection -- and granting them the option of having collected data deleted. Spokesman Brian Weiss said that for safety reasons the group \"has concerns\" about letting customers completely opt out -- but does endorse giving them greater control over how the data is used in marketing and by third parties.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a 2020 Pew Research survey, 52% of Americans said they had opted against using a product or service because they were worried about the amount of personal information it would collect about them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn security, Mozilla's minimum standards include encrypting all personal information on a car. The researchers said most car brands ignored their emailed questions on the matter, those that did offering partial, unsatisfactory responses.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJapan-based Nissan astounded researchers with the level of honesty and detailed breakdowns of data collection its privacy notice provides, a stark contrast with Big Tech companies such as Facebook or Google. \"Sensitive personal information\" collected includes driver's license numbers, immigration status, race, sexual orientation and health diagnoses.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFurther, Nissan says it can share \"inferences\" drawn from the data to create profiles \"reflecting the consumer's preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behaviour, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt was among six car companies that said they could collect \"genetic information\" or \"genetic characteristics,\" the researchers found.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNissan also said it collected information on \"sexual activity.\" It didn't explain how.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe all-electric Tesla brand scored high on Mozilla's \"creepiness\" index. If an owner opts out of data collection, Tesla's privacy notice says the company may not be able to notify drivers \"in real time\" of issues that could result in \"reduced functionality, serious damage, or inoperability.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNeither Nissan nor Tesla immediately responded to questions about their practices.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMozilla's Caltrider credited laws like the 27-nation European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and California's Consumer Privacy Act for compelling carmakers to provide existing data collection information.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt's a start, she said, by raising awareness among consumers just as occurred in the 2010s when a consumer backlash prompted TV makers to offer more alternatives to surveillance-heavy connected displays.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

During the past four or five years, automakers have been shunning auto shows as the preferred places to reveal new models. Instead, they're opting to show them online for less money and at times when they don't have to share the limelight with others.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Detroit show will instead focus more on experiences for consumers, including an indoor electric vehicle track and on-street ride-and-drives. Tesla, absent from the show for years, will return for those events with a display on the floor.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe F-150 will get a new front grille, dark-coloured headlamps and some new vents, as well as added features. Ford will drop a 3.3-litre V6 engine as the base power plant. Even the lowest trim line of XL now will get the company's more powerful 325-horsepower 2.7-litre twin-turbocharger V6 as standard equipment. All other engines remain.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop headlines on electric vehicles, and all the latest automotive news \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInside, the interior gets an update, plus all models get a 12-inch touchscreen as standard equipment.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGas-electric hybrids, which Ford says are now 10% of all F-150 sales, will see the same cosmetic changes as well as a smoother transition between gasoline and electric power.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPerhaps the coolest feature is what Ford calls the \"Pro Access Tailgate,\" part of which can swing open like a door for loading and unloading even while towing a trailer. The door can swing open 100 degrees for loading larger objects, and it stops at 37 degrees so it doesn't hit parts of a trailer. Of course, the hitch will fold flat as well. The feature is standard on top trim lines, optional on others, and not available on lower-cost models.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThere's also a small storage box in the rear that's standard on 5 1/2 and 6 1/2-foot beds.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tChief Engineer Milton Wong says testing is still being done, but while emissions are lower in the 2024 model, he doesn't expect the F-150's fuel economy to improve over the 2023 models. To meet future government gas mileage and pollution requirements, engineers will recalibrate the engines, transmissions and exhaust systems, he said. Currently, a two-wheel-drive F-150 with a 2.7-litre engine gets 26 miles per gallon on the highway.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis is the second update on the F-150 without changing the truck's underpinnings, a trend in the industry to get several product cycles without major changes. In the past, vehicles would get new underpinnings every four or five years, but automakers have been conserving capital so they have money to develop and build electric vehicles.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWong said the current F-150 platform is very capable, and using it multiple times allows engineers to concentrate on technology to make towing easier or provide electric power at job sites.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The reality is that most of these platforms are so good that completely engineering it from scratch every four years doesn't make any sense,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst with Guidehouse Insights. With automakers spending billions to develop and manufacture electric vehicles, it makes sense to keep existing internal combustion vehicles on the road longer, he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnd most analysts forecast that electric vehicle sales will grow at the expense of gas-powered models. \"Putting huge amounts of money into internal combustion engine platforms, you're not necessarily going to get much return on that,\" Abuelsamid said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe updated F-150 goes on sale in the U.S. sometime next year at a starting price of US$35,570 excluding shipping. That's about US$1,700 more than the current base model.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The 41-year-old has repaved her career path more than a few times, turning self-described “side hustles” into full-time focuses as an entrepreneur.\n \n “I’ve gone through so much transition and change. I've pivoted from corporate banking to owning a small business, so this is no different,” she told CTVNews.ca in a recent interview. “The things that I'm learning are different, they're unique, because they're all about politics and policies… but that's the only difference.”\n \n  \n \nElection 2021: Results in all ridings \n \n \n Valdez spent years in the financial sector before deciding to branch out into a series of creative avenues. Her latest endeavour will see her make history when she takes her seat in the House of Commons on Nov. 22, because she’ll be doing so as Canada’s first federally-elected Filipina MP.\n \n “I myself have the unique opportunity of also not just representing Mississauga-Streetsville, but for the first time being able to be the voice of a larger community,” Valdez said. “I realize the responsibility that lays on me to be able to speak about the issues that are very similar to others, but very unique to Filipinos… It’s a very proud moment.”\n \n Valdez is one of the 50 rookie MPs elected in the 2021 federal election. CTVNews.ca is profiling five—one from each party with a seat in the Commons— in the lead up to the first sitting day of the 44th Parliament.\n \n Among the entrepreneurial endeavours Valdez has tackled pre-politics: owning a baking business called ‘Chietopia’ after becoming a self-taught home baker; co-founding a line of Filipino fusion pastries that until just before the pandemic were carried at T&T; and, competed on the latest season of Food Network Canada’s competition show ‘The Big Bake.’\n \n She’s also used her love for basketball to help raise money for SickKids, and over this past summer she hosted a television show on Filipino TV called ‘Fearlessly Creative,’ where she had conversations with other entrepreneurs and artists, which she described as “pivotal” in her decision to run for MP.\n \n “If you go into politics… you know there's a little bit of fearlessness involved. By choosing to put my name on the ballot, it took me to have a little courage, and have faith in myself and believe in who I am as an individual and what I bring to the table,” she said.\n \n A long-time Liberal supporter, Valdez said her interest in running for politics was sparked years ago after watching a couple friends campaign for city council positions, and helping them knock on doors.\n \n Then in the lead-up to her campaign, considering that the incumbent Liberal Gagan Sikand likely wasn’t going to run for re-election after going on medical leave in 2020, then-Liberal Party national campaign co-chair \nNavdeep Bains and nearby MP and minister Omar Alghabra\n met up with her for coffee and to discuss her potential candidacy.\n \n Bains told CTVNews.ca that her name had come up as someone who would be a strong voice for small businesses, her community, and women.\n \n Asked what his impression was of her after that meeting, Bains described her as being very composed, thoughtful and having “good energy.” That bore out during the campaign, he said.\n \n “She is someone that we saw… was just an incredible hard worker. She was very eager to get out every single day and knock on doors, super motivated,” Bains said.\n \n Born in Zambia, Valdez and her family immigrated to Canada at 1989 when she was nine years old. Her family then put down roots in the riding she now represents.\n \n During the campaign, she was flooded with childhood memories while out door-knocking in neighbourhoods she used to play in, she said, adding that her long-time connection to the area helped her relate to the sometimes hard stories she heard from voters.\n \n “I really felt those stories and… I feel a great responsibility to be able to be that voice to advocate for them,” said Valdez.\n \n \nLiberal MP Rechie Valdez with her family during the 2021 federal election.

(Photo courtesy Rechie Valdez)\n \n Valdez won her riding with 47.3 per cent of the vote, as part of a Liberal sweep of the six Mississauga ridings on Sept. 20.\n \n “People opened up and people shared so much and so I think it just speaks to kind of her personality. She's someone that is very open,” Bains said.\n \n On election night, she thanked her six-year-old daughter Cassidy for swapping her Nutella sandwiches for ‘Lucky Charms’ cereal for breakfast during the campaign in hopes it would rub off on her mom.\n \n The campaign was a bit of a family affair, with her husband Christopher helping organize sign deliveries and her mom joining her door knocking.\n \n The issues Valdez said will be top of her agenda include housing affordability—a pressing concern in her GTA riding—as well as supporting seniors like her parents who worked hard to give her and her brother the life they had. Valdez also mentioned climate change as a top-ranking preoccupation, saying it’s something her 12-year-old son Kyle also cares deeply about.\n \n Travelling to Ottawa for her MP orientation training and getting to walk into West Block, where she realized that she’s got a spot in the glass-enclosed Chamber earlier this fall, was a “phenomenal experience,” she said, strengthening her resolve to get things done for her constituents.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Col. George Bivens said. In the meantime, tactical teams secured the area, and later moved in with search dogs, Bivens said at a news conference.\n \n  \n \nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n \n \n \"The were able to move in very quietly. They had the element of surprise,\" Bivens said. \"Cavalcante did not realize he was surrounded until that had occurred.\"\n \n Cavalcante -- still armed with the rifle -- tried to escape by crawling through thick underbrush, Bivens said, and he continued to resist as he was taken into custody after 8 a.m. He was bitten on the scalp by a police dog and suffered a minor wound, he said. No shots were fired.\n \n \"He was desperate, and it was just a matter of time,\" said Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n \n State police had announced Cavalcante's capture on social media earlier Wednesday, as the search entered its 14th day. The attorney general's office said Cavalcante will be arraigned on a felony escape charge.\n \n Aerial footage from WPVI-TV news showed an armoured vehicle with Cavalcante arriving at the Pennsylvania State Police barracks at Avondale. A handful of officers pulled from the back of the vehicle and quickly led him into the building. He was handcuffed and wrapped in what appeared to be a thermal blanket. Bivens said investigators would try to interview him about his time on the run before taking him to a state prison.\n \n The end to the search for Cavalcante, 34, unfolded just beyond Philadelphia's heavily populated suburbs, in an area of woods, rolling farmland and a county park. Police brought in hundreds of heavily armed law enforcement personnel with dogs, armoured carriers, horses, and helicopters that circled overhead.\n \n The search forced schools to close right at the start of the academic year, led to warnings for homeowners to lock their doors, and blocked roads over the busy Labor Day weekend. Overnight into Wednesday, heavily armed law enforcement officers searched for the fugitive through downpours and thunder.\n \n Cavalcante escaped from the Chester County jail in southeastern Pennsylvania on Aug. 31 by crab-walking up between two walls that were topped with razor wire, then jumping from the roof and dashing away. He had been awaiting transfer to state prison after being sentenced days earlier for fatally stabbing his girlfriend, and is wanted in connection with another killing in Brazil.\n \n \nLaw enforcement officers gather as the search for escaped convict Danelo Cavalcante continues Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023, in Pottstown, Pa. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n \n Authorities said over the weekend that Cavalcante had slipped out of the initial search area, shaved and changed his clothing, stole a vehicle to travel miles to seek aid from former co-workers in the northern part of the county, and then abandoned the vehicle, at least in part because it was low on fuel.\n \n Authorities have declined to say how they think Cavalcante slipped out of the first search area, and officials have pushed back against questions about whether they blew a chance to catch him.\n \n Then, late Monday, a motorist alerted police to a man matching Cavalcante's description crouching in the darkness along a line of trees near a road in northern Chester County. Police found footprints and tracked them to the prison shoes identical to those Cavalcante had been wearing. A pair of work boots was reported stolen from a porch nearby.\n \n State police said they believe he was looking for a place to hide when he saw an open garage. There, he stole a .22-calibre rifle and ammunition, and fled when the homeowner who was in the garage drew a pistol and shot at him several times, state police said.\n \n That led hundreds of law enforcement personnel to search an area of about 8 to 10 square miles near South Coventry Township, roughly 30 miles northwest (50 kilometres) of Philadelphia.\n \n Cavalcante's escape was big news in Brazil, where prosecutors in Tocantins state say he is accused of \"double qualified homicide\" in the 2017 slaying of Valter Junior Moreira dos Reis in the municipality of Figueiropolis, which authorities say was over a debt the victim owed him in connection with repair of a vehicle.\n \n Pennsylvania authorities even broadcast a recording of Cavalcante's mother speaking in Portuguese imploring him to surrender peacefully.\n \n Cavalcante received a life sentence in Pennsylvania in August for killing his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in front of her children in 2021. Prosecutors say he murdered her to stop her from telling police he was wanted in the Brazil killing. He had been arrested in Virginia after Brandao's killing, and authorities say they believe he was trying to return to Brazil.\n \n The prison tower guard on duty when Cavalcante escaped was fired. The escape went undetected for more than an hour until guards took a headcount.\n \n ------\n \n \nLevy reported from Harrisburg, Pa., and Rubinkam from northeastern Pennsylvania.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

But many doctors have questioned phenylephrine’s effectiveness for years. These products generated nearly US$1.8 billion in sales last year alone, according to data from the FDA that was presented to the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee on Monday during the committee’s two-day meeting.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Tuesday, the committee voted no on the specific question: “Do the current scientific data that were presented support that the monograph dosage of orally administered phenylephrine is effective as a nasal decongestant.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe vote was unanimous among its 16 members, and the committee agreed that the issue doesn’t need to be studied any further.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We really should not have products on the market that are not effective,” said committee member Dr. Diane Ginsburg of the University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe FDA told the committee it would take its advice into consideration, although it did not give a timeline. If the agency decides to reclassify phenylephrine from Generally Recognized as Safe and Effective (GRASE), stakeholders would have the opportunity to comment on the proposed change and to provide any additional data. During that process, companies would still be allowed to market products with phenylephrine. But if the FDA agrees with the committee, companies may be required to remove products with phenylephrine from store shelves or reformulate them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe agency approved phenylephrine for over-the-counter use in the 1970s, but it became even more common after 2005, when legislation restricted access to OTC drugs that use a similar decongestant ingredient called pseudoephedrine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn 2007, the FDA committee looked at the science available at that time and came to a different conclusion, agreeing that the phenylephrine “may be effective,” but it also called for more research.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tStudies since then, including three large clinical trials, showed that the orally administered ingredient is not effective as a decongestant in its typical dosage.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe committee also looked at other research used to support its use over-the-counter. The FDA found that those study results were inconsistent and many did not meet modern scientific standards.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe committee did not take up the issue of nasal spray products that use phenylephrine, which studies seem to show are effective, at least temporarily.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPhenylephrine is considered the most common ingredient in over-the-counter oral nasal and sinus products, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.\n \nLast year, the group supported\n a citizens petition to remove the drug’s over-the-counter status.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPhenylephrine works by temporarily reducing the swelling of blood vessels in the nasal passages. A respiratory infection or allergies prompt the body to send white blood cells to the nose, throat and sinuses, leading to swelling in the nasal membranes and the creation of mucus. Decongestants constrict the blood vessels in the sinuses and nose, reducing the swelling and helping fluids drain.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn pill form, some scientists say, phenylephrine gets absorbed by the gut and is metabolized so well that only a tiny bit makes it to the bloodstream, where it is needed to reach the nose, according to the \ncitizen petition\n that asks the FDA to pull the drug from store shelves. A \ncitizen petition\n is a way for industry, consumer groups or individuals to petition the FDA to change regulations or take other administrative action.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn discussing Tuesday’s vote, the committee agreed that safety wasn’t why they wanted the FDA to take action on these products. Rather, they were advising the FDA to act because the tablets were essentially a waste of money, and over-the-counter medications can help people who have colds or allergies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It’s amazing the amount of dollars being spent on something that has really no efficacy,” said committee member Dr. William Fig, a clinical pharmacologist and investigator at the National Cancer Institute.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEvery year, many Americans seek relief with over-the-counter cold and allergy medicine. About 60 million people in the United States have allergies, and adults get two to four colds per year, according to the \nAmerican Lung Association\n, for a total of 1 billion colds a year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tColds and allergies can have a significant effect on quality of life, \nstudies show\n. In addition to a runny nose and coughs, allergies and colds can aggravate asthma and cause trouble sleeping.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA change to phenylephrine’s designation could be costly to manufacturers. The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents makers of over-the-counter medicines and dietary supplements as well as consumer medical devices, opposes a change.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe \nassociation said\n Tuesday that it was disappointed in the committee’s decision and encouraged the FDA, before it makes any regulatory changes, to “be mindful of the totality of the evidence supporting this long-standing OTC ingredient, as well as the significantly negative unintended consequences associated with any potential change in oral PE’s regulatory status.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt told the FDA committee that its surveys show that people prefer their decongestants in tablet form over nasal spray. If these drugs were not available anymore, it could be a real burden to consumers, the association said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Tuesday, the FDA committee said that if the FDA decides to reclassify phenylephrine and it goes off the market, the agency will need to educate the public about why some of popular allergy and cold drugs were no longer available.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf phenylephrine is no longer available, there are several other OTC options including nasal spray antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids and nasal saline products, as well as tablets with pseudoephedrine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tProducts with pseudoephedrine are considered OTC but are kept behind the counter because in large quantities, pseudoephedrine can be used to make the illegal drug methamphetamine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nCNN’s Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Minister says it's an option", "summary": "", "content": "\n     \n    \n\r\n\tCanada's Housing Minister Sean Fraser says that a cap on the number of international students permitted to study in this country is one of, but not the only, solution the federal government is discussing when it comes to addressing housing affordability and rental availability.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn Monday, Fraser was asked whether the federal government was willing to put a cap on international students as a way to address the current crunch, and he said it was \"one of the options that we ought to consider.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tExpanding on this in an interview with CTV News' Chief Political Correspondent Vassy Kapelos on Tuesday at the federal cabinet retreat in Charlottetown, P.E.I., the minister said a decision has not yet been taken on a cap, but the rapidly increasing number of international students does need to be examined as part of the bigger housing crisis picture.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nHousing affordability in Canada a 'crisis' and 'opportunity,' Fraser says\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There's conversations I've had on a range of different options with [Immigration] Minister Miller. There's some work that we were looking at how to better partner with institutions… but I don't think we should be afraid to talk openly about the different options that we ought to consider,\" Fraser said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think Canadians who are struggling to see themselves in the housing market, see a future for themselves in our community, they deserve to know that we're looking under every stone for the solutions that exist, both on the supply and demand side of the equation.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nCapital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFraser told Kapelos that he thinks housing has become a national crisis for some—including students who have to live more than an hour away from where they study—while others have clearly profited off the skyrocketing cost of housing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"What we've seen is certain private colleges in particular, who I think are abusing the program… who are not providing housing options near where their places of study exist, if they're providing them at all,\" Fraser said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The international student program is extraordinary. It serves Canada's interests, it contributes tens of billions of dollars to our GDP, and it provides a pipeline of young and talented people who will be Canadian one day, but… the people who come need to be better supported.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nCape Breton community seeks help for struggling international students \n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe minister was clear that multiple levels of jurisdiction have roles to play in resolving the specific international student issue. In some cases, Canadian schools are recruiting and enrolling more students than there is room available. Fraser said institutions need to be able to provide adequate supports such as a place to live.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat said, Fraser said the federal government does need to \"manage the growth\" more effectively because of the \"unique localized impact\" in some of the communities where these students come to study.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The jurisdictional challenge relates to the fact that provinces get to select designated learning institutes—which schools can benefit from the program—that's not a decision that the federal government can take unilaterally,\" Fraser said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOutside of Parliament Hill on Monday, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre held a housing-focused press conference, continuing his critique of the Liberals' handling of the file. He was asked whether he would support rolling back immigration levels to ease the strain on housing, but didn't directly answer the question.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think Justin Trudeau would love Canadians to blame immigrants for the housing prices that he has doubled, but immigrants are just following the rules that he put in place. So how can we blame them and not him?\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFraser, who recently accused Poilievre of proposing housing policy initiatives that the Liberals have campaigned and acted on already, said he's viewing the current situation as both a challenge and an opportunity, and has vowed to present Canadians with a fulsome plan in the months ahead.  \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

That was before Canada launched a major response to the refugee crisis sparked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and approved hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and their families to come to Canada temporarily to escape the war.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThose efforts, combined with updates to the government's aging technology, have led to longer waits for people who want to come to Canada, Fraser said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs of the end of July, approximately 1.3 million immigration applications in the system have taken longer to process than the government's service standards dictate they should. That's about 54 per cent of all the pending applications in the system.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn an interview with The Canadian Press, Fraser said the department may need a few extra months before all immigration streams are back to normal processing times.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Based on what we're looking at right now, we shouldn't be too, too far off the projection of getting back to service standards for work and study permits by the end of this year, and I expect that within a few months of that the visitors visas will be back to service standards,\" Fraser said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat's barring any new international disasters, he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNDP Immigration critic Jenny Kwan said the minister's optimism is of little comfort to people who have spent months or even years languishing in the system.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I find it astounding that the minister would talk glowingly about the work that he's doing, meanwhile, there's so many people who are struggling, who are suffering as a result of immigration processing delays,\" Kwan said in an interview.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe wrote a joint letter with NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to express their concerns about the \"utter chaos\" at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFraser said the Canadian immigration system is seeing unprecedented demand, in addition to humanitarian crises.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs of July 31, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada had issued more than 349,000 new work permits this year, compared to 199,000 in all of 2021.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt a news conference Wednesday, Fraser announced the Immigration Department is in the midst of a hiring spree to bring 1,250 new employees on board by the end of the fall to tackle the massive backlogs in processing applications and the increased demand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFraser said the new hires have so far allowed the government to get wait times back on track for new applicants to the express entry permanent residence program, the main economic stream for new permanent residents to Canada.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"In the weeks and months ahead there's going to be a series of new measures that we're going to be releasing that's going to help bring workers here more quickly, make it simpler for families to be reunited with their loved ones, and to hold ourselves accountable by being transparent,\" Fraser said at the news conference outside the Vancouver Convention Centre.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe backlogs have been of growing concern since shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic began, when health restrictions made borders more difficult to cross and immigration slowed considerably.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt the end of last year, the government dedicated $85 million to reducing wait times. Another $187.3 million was set aside for the next five years in the 2022 budget.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn June, the prime minister announced ministers would form a task force to deal with growing delays for immigration applications and other government services.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tConservative immigration critic Jasraj Singh Hallan says he has little faith the added resources will translate into meaningful change.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"This is the Liberal pattern, throw more money at a problem, create a bloated public service costing taxpayers more, and get no results,\" Hallan said in a statement.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Newcomers, Canadians, and businesses deserve better than Liberal-made backlogs and more empty promises.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 24, 2022.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

These events upended your educations, your first jobs, your early years of building a career and a network,\" said the prime minister in Charlottetown on Wednesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAfter highlighting what the government has done to try to address these strains so far, from offering ways to save up to buy a home to eliminating interest on student loans, Trudeau noted \"there's lots more to do.\"   \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nCapital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We owe it to you to take action, so you can fully benefit from the promise of Canada.

So that you can have both a healthy economy and a healthy environment in strong, vibrant communities long into the future. As a team, this is one of our top priorities,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrudeau's millennial reach-out comes after cabinet was to hear directly during the retreat from Paul Kershaw, the founder of \nGeneration Squeeze a think-tank\n focused on advocating for young Canadians struggling to get ahead in the current economic climate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis renewed messaging targeted at younger voters also follows \nrecent polling by Abacus Data\n, which found the Liberals were trailing the Conservatives by 11 points among millennials (those born between 1980 and 1996), and among Gen Z voters (those born between 1997 and 2005) Trudeau's party is four points behind Poilievre's Conservative Party.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking to CTV News at the cabinet retreat, Kershaw said Poilievre should be credited for \"tapping into\" the grief many young people are feeling, but cautioned that if his \"doom and gloom momentum\" gives rise to a disillusionment it could have a counterintuitive effect given millennials'' lasting electoral sway.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"If it gives rise to more cynicism, and has younger people opt out, and we need them to opt in with their parents and grandparents to change the system… so that we can make our policies ready for the moment… cynicism won't get us there,\" Kershaw said. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tA new analysis by RBC released Wednesday warns that millennials \nare \"more indebted than ever.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Canadians between the ages of 35 and 44 (who have debt) had a total debt-to-disposable income ratio of 250 per cent in 2019. That’s far heavier than the debt load that was carried by Canadians of the same age in 1999,\" reads the post. \"Younger indebted millennials (under age 35) aren’t faring much better, with debt loads worth 165 per cent of their disposable income.\" \n\r\n\n\r\n\tHOUSING TOP PRIORITY BUT NO NEW ACTION\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBacked by his recently-rejigged front bench of ministers, the prime minister said that heading into the fall, the rising cost of housing will be one of the minority Liberal government's \"core\" priorities, however he's wrapping up the three-day retreat without announcing any concrete actions on that front.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrudeau said the retreat was productive, included hearing directly from Canadians who are struggling to buy a home or afford rising rents, as well as studying historical trends and StatCan census data, but offered no timelines or specifics on further efforts to tackle the housing crisis beyond building more homes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Everyone agrees that it's a complex issue that requires solutions that bring together all orders of government, the private sector, and the non-profit sector… Middle-class Canadians who want to build equity through homeownership feel increasingly like that dream is out of reach. And now, more and more renters in the housing market means rising demand is causing rent to rise for everyone,\" Trudeau said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe Offer newsletter: Sign up for complete coverage of Canadian real estate news\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tZeroing in on Trudeau's handling of housing and how it's impacting young people in a press conference outside of the House of Commons, Poilievre panned the prime minister for coming away from cabinet without a plan, while comparing the current housing market to prison.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The truth is… for young people and the working class the housing market after eight years of Justin Trudeau is a prison. It's a prison of walls for 350 square foot apartments that cost $2,000 A month. Or parents' basements where young adults of 35 years old live, never having a chance to start a family with their biological clocks running out,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPoilievre spoke about how the \"average mortgage payment in Canada has now risen to $3,500.\" Though, by the end of the availability upon questioning from reporters, he clarified that the figure he was citing was based on one housing analysts' assessment of newly purchased homes with a 20 per cent down payment.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe ended his availability calling for Trudeau to recall the House of Commons, which is on a summer break. \n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\"Open up the House so Canadians can get a home,\" he said. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh called it a \"complete failure of leadership\" that Trudeau's cabinet walked away from the east coast waterfront confab without announcing any new housing policy plans.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"One of the most serious things that we're up against. How does that make any sense? We're faced with a housing crisis, and we've got Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who's busy blaming others saying it's not his responsibility. We've got Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who wants to blame cities. New Democrats want to build,\" Singh said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSingh said while he's happy to talk housing \"any day,\" he didn't specifically say whether he agrees with his opposition colleagues in calling for an early House recall. \n\r\n\n\r\n\tINTERNATIONAL STUDENTS 'EASY VILLAN'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrudeau said the government is being careful to not place blame on any one group such as foreign homebuyers, aggressive developers, or international students. Rather he is viewing the current crisis as one simmering for decades, exacerbated by a multitude of factors, and not solvable with one \"silver bullet.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think it's really critical at this moment for the federal government to acknowledge the grief that a younger demographic is feeling about being locked out of housing as renters and as owners,\" Kershaw said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t Still, there was much chatter at the cabinet retreat over the \nLiberals considering a cap\n on international students as one way to tamp down skyrocketing rent. \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We only get through this by rolling up our sleeves and getting the work done… And the good news is, Canada has done this before. We have faced housing crises before in our history,\" Trudeau said, pointing to the post-WWII era when governments built entire neighborhoods.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKershaw said that in order to \"meet the moment,\" the federal government can't then just pick an \"easy villain\" like the current focus on international students.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEchoing this in an interview on CTV News Channel, chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students and international student Maelis Barre called a potential cap “quite disappointing and shameful,” that if pursued would amount to a “band-aid solution” that doesn’t address the root issue of housing affordability.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We know that the housing crisis is rooted in complex economic and policy factors that have evolved over the decades,” Barre said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAsked his views on an international student cap, Poilievre accused current Housing Minister Sean Fraser, who until a few weeks ago was the immigration minister, of ruining the program.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We as Conservatives, we'll make sure that international students have homes, health care, and when they want it: jobs, so that we can get back to a system that supports our universities, attracts the world's brightest people, helps the demographics of our country, but does not leave people living in squalor,” Poilievre said.  \n\r\n\n\r\n\tCLIMATE POLICY 'MORE URGENT THAN EVER'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn the climate front, Trudeau called it a worsening \"emergency\" but similar to the housing issue, the cabinet retreat has not resulted in any announcement of new plans, seeing Trudeau make efforts to tout the existing carbon pricing and rebate program, and industrial green tech efforts.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking about the extreme weather witnessed across the country this summer, from devastating wildfires, to dangerous air quality blanketing much of Canada as a result of the smoke.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nClimate Barometer newsletter: Sign up for more on how a warming planet impacts you\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Climate policies are more urgent than ever. Canadians cannot afford leaders who want to roll them back,\" Trudeau said, in an apparent jab at Poilievre.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile Poilievre didn’t speak to, nor was he asked about the environment file on Wednesday, he has been running paid advertising on his fight against the carbon tax and recently had to postpone his tour of British Columbia and call off an \"axe the tax\" rally in Yukon due to the wildfires ravaging the region.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

While cases are rare, there has been at least one death in Canada, where approximately 3.5 million vehicles could be affected. Canadian transportation officials however lack the authority to demand a similarly sweeping recall, and expect automakers to take the lead.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tU.S. INVESTIGATION FINDS 'UNREASONABLE RISK OF INJURY AND DEATH'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn May, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) demanded that Knoxville-based ARC Automotive Inc. \nrecall 67 million airbag inflators\n. Following an \neight-year investigation\n, the NHTSA \"tentatively\" concluded that the devices are defective and pose a safety risk after at least seven injuries and two fatalities were linked to metal debris from exploding ARC inflators between 2009 and 2023.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMeant to safely inflate airbags, the devices can be found in vehicles from at least a dozen automakers, including 2002 to 2017 models by Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai, Kia and Chrysler parent Stellantis.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTennessee company refuses U.S. request to recall 67 million potentially dangerous air bag inflators\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nGM recalls 42,000 vehicles in Canada for air bag defect\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe first known fatality occurred in Canada in July 2016, when the \ndriver of a 2009 Hyundai Elantra in Newfoundland\n was killed by shrapnel from an airbag inflator that exploded during a low-speed collision.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe most recent incident occurred on March 22 this year, when a Michigan driver received facial injuries after an airbag inflator ruptured in their 2017 Chevrolet Traverse.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to U.S. officials, other incidents have involved models like the 2002 Chrysler Town and Country, 2004 Kia Optima, 2010 Chevrolet Malibu, 2015 Chevrolet Traverse, 2015 Volkswagen Golf and 2016 Audi A3.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a \nMay letter to ARC Automotive\n, U.S. regulators blamed \"over pressurization\" for the issue and said airbag inflators \"when not defective\" are \"designed to save lives.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Air bag inflators that project metal fragments into vehicle occupants, rather than properly inflating the attached air bag, create an unreasonable risk of death and injury,\" a the letter from the NHTSA asserted.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company has so far refused to act, setting the stage for a potential legal battle.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We disagree with NHTSA’s new sweeping request when extensive field testing has found no inherent defect,” an ARC Automotive spokesperson told the Associated Press.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWHAT MAKES AND MODELS ARE AFFECTED?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile U.S. authorities have not released a full list of affected vehicles, Transport Canada previously published one that covers \nat least 90 makes and models\n, including three SUVs \nrecalled earlier in May by General Motors\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTotalling \n42,000 vehicles in Canada\n and \nnearly one million in the U.S\n., General Motors recalled the Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia and Chevrolet Traverse SUVs from 2014 to 2017 due to \"risk of injury or death\" from ARC airbag inflators.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nDoes your vehicle an ARC airbag inflator? See the list from Transport Canada\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTransport Canada says there are approximately 3.5 million vehicles in the country with driver-side ARC airbag inflators, which is more than one in 10 registered vehicles. Transport Canada's extensive list features popular Canadian models from 1998 and 2017 from major brands like BMW, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Fiat, Ford, Mercury, Lincoln, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Hummer, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Saab, Saturn, Hyundai and Kia. The full list can be \ndownloaded here\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAn exact number of impacted vehicles in the U.S. has not been released, but it \ncould exceed 33 million\n, since the 67 million devices U.S. authorities want recalled include both driver- and passenger-side airbag inflators. They were manufactured in Tennessee, Mexico and China before January 2018, when ARC made production changes to better detect potential problems.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWHAT ARE U.S. AND CANADIAN AUTHORITIES DOING?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAside from the recent General Motors recall, automakers previously only recalled models with ARC airbag inflators from the same production lots as known incidents. Those recalls affected just 6,300 vehicles from BMW, Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen in the U.S. —a tiny fraction of what regulators are now calling for.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe \n2016 incident in Newfoundland\n also prompted a Transport Canada investigation, which ended in 2022 and saw the lot-specific recall of \nover 2,300 Hyundai Elantra vehicles from 2009\n, the same model as the Newfoundland incident, as well as 780 other vehicles from BMW, Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The department’s investigation into this incident and the potential root cause for the airbag inflator rupture was extensive and thorough,\" Transport Canada's \n2022 report said\n. \"The recalled parts were sent back to the supplier for examination and testing, and they all passed quality review.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTransport Canada relies on automakers to report defects and issue recalls, and lacks the legal power to demand a sweeping recall like its U.S. counterpart.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Unlike the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Transport Canada has no direct authority over component suppliers like ARC Automotive Inc.,\" a Transport Canada spokesperson told CTVNews.ca. \"However, the department expects companies to issue a notice of safety defect in Canada for substantially similar vehicles and components that are recalled in other countries, including any recalls for ARC airbag inflators.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the spokesperson, the 2016 death in Newfoundland is the only known ARC airbag inflator rupture in Canada.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn an email to CTVNews.ca, an NHTSA spokesperson said they are currently evaluating ARC Automotive's response, and that next steps could include a public notice and meeting.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"NHTSA has investigated and identified a risk associated with a set of ARC air bag inflators that if left unaddressed would lead to more incidents in the future,\" the spokesperson told CTVNews.ca. \"While incidents are rare, the incidents that have occurred have been severe, prompting the agency to issue a recall request.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTransport Canada and the NHTSA say they continue to work together to identify the root cause of the issue.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMANUFACTURER AND AUTOMAKERS RESPOND\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBased in Knoxville, Tenn., ARC Automotive appears more in favour of limited recalls like those in Canada. In its \nreply to the NHTSA\n's letter, an ARC executive argued that automakers have not found a defect common to all 67 million inflators, and that a root cause has not been identified in known ruptures, which they described as \"isolated events.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"ARC strongly disagrees with the Agency’s 'tentative conclusion' that a safety defect exists in the 67 million toroidal driver and passenger inflators produced during the 18-year period prior to January 2018,\" the reply from ARC stated. \"ARC believes they resulted from random ‘one-off’ manufacturing anomalies that were properly addressed by vehicle manufacturers through lot-specific recalls.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tARC Automotive did not respond to a request for comment. CTVNews.ca also reached out to the automakers mentioned in this story. Only Ford, Hyundai, Kia, General Motors and Stellantis replied. Those automakers said they continue to monitor or investigate the situation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGeneral Motors added it recently recalled certain 2014 to 2017 SUV models because \"the front-driver airbag inflator may contain a supplier manufacturing defect that may result in inflator rupture during deployment.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"GM continues to investigate this issue with the assistance of a third-party engineering firm with nationally respected engineering expertise in airbag-inflator performance,\" a spokesperson told CTVNews.ca. \"GM is taking this expanded field action out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of our customers as our highest priority.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHyundai, which was implicated in the fatal 2016 incident in Newfoundland, said it is working closely with both Transport Canada and the NHTSA.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Hyundai Canada has conducted two parts return recalls of ARC airbag inflators to protect customer safety and further investigate this part following a previous incident,\" a spokesperson told CTVNews.ca, referring to earlier Canadian recalls of just over 2,300 vehicles. \"At Hyundai, our goal is to place customers’ safety first and we will not hesitate to conduct further recalls if needed.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMichael Brooks, executive director of the U.S.-based non-profit Center for Auto Safety, told the Associated Press that the ARC issue is less dangerous than the one behind the \nTakata airbag recalls\n, which began in 2001 and involved as many as 40 million vehicles and more than a dozen deaths. It took years before consumers learned if their vehicles were impacted, and \nautomakers like BMW and Honda are still issuing \"do not drive\" warnings\n about the issue, which led to \nTakata filing for bankruptcy in 2017\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBrooks says drivers should insist that dealers disclose if their vehicles have ARC airbag inflators.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Customers, I think, have a right to know if there’s a potential defect in their car, particularly if it’s sitting a few inches from their chest and can explode,\" Brooks told the Associated Press. \"The more customers who complain, the more pressure that puts on the manufacturers.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nWith files from the Associated Press\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

While there are many benefits to electric cars, the question of whether they are a good financial choice in Canada is still up in the air.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough electric cars can cost more upfront, they may offer long-term financial benefits due to lower operating costs and government incentives. Below, I’ll break down some of the main pros and cons of investing in an electric vehicle, so you can determine if it’s the right choice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAre there any tax breaks or incentives for having electric cars in Canada?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis past December, the government of Canada passed a federal mandate to increase the total supply of electric vehicles in the country. This mandate will require auto importers and manufacturers to meet a certain \nsales quota\n for new electric or zero-emission vehicles, as follows:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t20 per cent by 2026\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t60 per cent by 2030\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t100 per cent by 2035\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn other words - by 2035, all new vehicles sold in Canada must be zero-emission vehicles. For now, this means electric vehicles. However, some auto manufacturers are also pursuing alternatives, such as vehicles powered by hydrogen-powered fuel cells.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTo support this, the federal government and provincial governments are offering incentives and tax breaks for EV owners, including:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tUp to $5,000 in tax rebates for buying qualifying zero-emission vehicles. To be eligible, the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) must be \nless than $55,000 for passenger vehicles\n and less than $60,000 for station wagons, pickup trucks, SUVs, minivans, vans or special purpose vehicles. For passenger vehicles with higher-priced trims, the MSRP must be less than $65,000. For station wagons, pickup trucks, SUVs, minivans, vans or special purpose vehicles with higher-priced trims, the MSRP must be less than $70,000.\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tProvincial incentives for purchasing electric vehicles. For example, in British Columbia, \nresidents can receive up to $4,000\n for purchasing or leasing a new electric vehicle. \nIn Quebec, the provincial government offers rebates of up to $7,000\n for purchasing or leasing an electric vehicle.\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tReduced parking fees for EVs in some cities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhich is the most reliable electric car?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEVs are taking the market by storm, and most major auto manufacturers have released an EV or are actively working on producing one.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nClimate Barometer newsletter: Sign up to keep your finger on the climate pulse\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSince the technology is relatively new, though, there have been some hiccups, and not every EV is a reliable investment.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCurrently, the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, and Kia EV6 are the most \nreliable electric cars\n, according to \nConsumer Reports\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAdvantages of an electric car\n\r\n\n\r\n\tElectric cars have several notable advantages over combustion-powered vehicles, including:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tLower fuel costs. Charging an EV in your home or at a charging station is typically cheaper than fuelling a combustion engine with gasoline or diesel. The cost of electricity also tends to be more stable than the cost of petroleum products.\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tFewer moving parts. \nEVs have fewer moving parts\n than combustion vehicles. You don’t have to worry about drive belts, alternators, oil changes, complex cooling systems, fuel delivery systems, and other systems that must be constantly serviced in combustion vehicles.\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tTax breaks. Purchasing a new EV can garner you a $5,000 federal tax break. Several provinces also offer their own provincial tax breaks for purchasing a new EV.\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tQuicker acceleration. Electric motors are capable of faster acceleration, compared to combustion engines, which can improve your overall driving experience.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDisadvantages of an electric car\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUnfortunately, EVs also come with their fair share of disadvantages, including:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tLimited range and long charging time. Most EVs cannot drive more than 300-400 km on a single charge, so they’re not a great choice for long road trips. Often, charging can take several hours or longer. The Tesla Supercharger network is an exception, allowing users to get about 320 km of range in 15 minutes.\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tPoor cold weather performance. EVs are powered by lithium batteries, which can often be fickle in Canada’s extreme winters. Battery life, range, and power distribution may not always be consistent.\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tHigh upfront cost. Although EVs are gradually becoming more affordable, they’re still more expensive than combustion-powered vehicles.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHow long do electric cars last?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSince EVs are relatively new, there’s no conclusive data on how long they last. However, most estimates claim that EV batteries should be able to last between eight and 15 years, depending on their usage. Canada’s extreme climate will likely contribute to batteries dying quicker.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat being said, Tesla is currently working on designing a battery capable of lasting up to \n1 million miles\n (1,609,344 km). So this could change very quickly.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAside from replacing the battery, though, EVs require very little maintenance. Most issues involve common wear-and-tear items, such as tires, brakes, sensors, and switches.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhat is the main problem with electric cars?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe main problem with EVs in Canada is that the country lacks the infrastructure to support mass EV adoption. The government plans to invest in more EV charging stations; \nthere are currently 20,641 chargers across 8,770 charging sites in Canada\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCanada’s growing electric vehicle infrastructure\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTo facilitate faster addition of zero-emission vehicles, the government is investing heavily to help support Canada’s EV infrastructure.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe government is investing in 50,000 EV charging stations throughout the country, offering increased tax rebates to those who’ve purchased a new EV, and \ninvesting in Canadian EV manufacturers\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs long as the government continues to provide support to reach its goals, then Canada’s EV infrastructure could support widespread adoption by its target date of 2035.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nChristopher Liew is a CFA Charterholder and former financial advisor.

We're going to stop doing what's not working, we're going to do more of what working really well,\" Edwards told The Canadian Press in an interview.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"From here, it's all about growth.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe name change to AtkinsRealis signifies an \"inflection point\" for the firm and offers a greater sense of belonging to employees who work for its subsidiaries, Edwards said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company sold its unprofitable activities in the oil sector two years ago for a fraction of what it had paid in 2014 and no longer bids on fixed-price construction contracts due to frequent cost overruns, which are typically borne by the contractor.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast month, less than five years after SNC embarked on a mission to streamline its operations, Edwards told analysts on a conference call the company aimed to blaze a \"methodical\" trail of mergers and acquisitions starting as early as 2024.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn this week's interview, he said the company will focus on mostly U.S. acquisitions, with two deals \"probably\" coming next year, followed by more in 2025. \"We will start small, and we'll do it very, very step by step. We're not going to go into big M&A,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe hoped-for turning point could mark the end of a long purgatory for SNC investors. The stock has traced a solid recovery since the start of the year, rising more than 75 per cent to top $43 per share. But the price remains at levels comparable to 2012, when questionable practices first surfaced and prompted the departure of former chief executive Pierre Duhaime.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDoubts persist in the financial community that SNC's newfound momentum will continue, particularly given its inconsistent performance over the years, said National Bank analyst Maxim Sytchev. But those worriescan overlook the fact the company has a new management team and board of directors, he added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"While we think that while margin expansion is certainly possible, it is by no means an easy task,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Montreal-based company said its symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange will change from SNC to ATRL as of Monday, Sept. 18.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe moniker \"SNC\" stems from early partners Surveyer, Nenniger and Chenevert, after whom the company was officially named in 1946, with the title later shortened to the three-letter abbreviation. SNC merged with its heavily indebted chief rival Lavalin in 1991.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company says its new name combines \"Atkins\" -- the U.K.-based engineering firm WS Atkins it bought in 2017 -- with \"Realis,\" a word \"inspired by the city of Montreal and the company's French-Canadian roots,\" the company said in a release Tuesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"'Realis' also resembles the verb 'to realize' or 'to make happen' which emphasizes our focus on outcomes and project delivery.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe ongoing francophone emphasis is key. Edwards, who hails from the United Kingdom, cancelled an English-only speech in 2021 in the wake of controversies over unilingual anglophone CEOs' serving atop several Montreal-based companies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAsked if the identity shift might mark a break with the firm's Montreal history, Edwards smiled.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"You know, we acquired Atkins. So it's not like a reverse,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're kind of hoping that the 'Realis' part of the name put those fears to bed ... This is absolutely staying a Quebec-based business with a head office in Montreal. Because there's no plans to move.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n- This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Your mortgage, car payment, credit card balance, and student loans are all liabilities that contribute to your total debt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHave you ever stopped to wonder how much debt is normal for your age, though?\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nGet the CTV News App now for breaking news alerts and all the top stories\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBelow, I’ll outline the average and median debt by age in Canada, so you can see how your finances compare. Then I’ll explain some of the key reasons why Canadians’ debt is increasing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAverage debt by age group in Canada\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFirst of all, it’s important to understand that debt is normal. Very few Canadians are 100% debt-free. Even those with near-perfect credit scores likely have an auto or student loan they’re paying down.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThese are the debt metrics measured by Statistics Canada during census surveys.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHere’s the average debt by age group in Canada as of 2019, according to the latest data sets from \nStatistics Canada\n:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tUnder 35: \n$69,500\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t35 to 44: \n$105,100\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t45 to 54: \n$130,100\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t55 to 64: \n$80,600\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t65 and older: \n$49,900\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNote - this data applies to individuals who are \nnot \nin an economic family. The numbers differ for economic families, which include married/common-law partners and families with dependent children.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe total debt measured includes:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tMortgage debt\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tLines of credit\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tCredit card debt\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tStudent loans\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tVehicle loans\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tOther debt (doesn’t fit in the categories above)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMedian debt by age group in Canada\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLooking at average debt provides a decent overview of the data. However, the averages are very skewed by the debt incurred by Canada’s ultra-wealthy taxpayers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen calculating the average, all values are added together and divided by the total number of values. This means that a few extreme values can greatly influence the result.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn contrast, the median is the middle value in a dataset when values are arranged in order. As such, it is less affected by outliers and provides a more accurate representation of typical values.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor example, a multi-millionaire with a $2-million mortgage will skew the average higher than the average Canadian.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor a more accurate look at Canadian debt, I find that the median data as of 2019 provides more accurate insight:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tUnder 35: \n$19,000\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t35 to 44: \n$35,200\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t45 to 54: \n$55,000\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t55 to 64: \n$30,000\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t65 and older: \n$10,000\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhy is consumer debt increasing in Canada?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOver the past year, consumer debt has notably increased. This is especially true for credit card debt. The average monthly spending per credit card increased by 17.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the previous year, according to a recent report by \nEquifax Canada\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the report Rebecca Oakes, vice-president of Advanced Analytics at Equifax Canada, stated that “\nGen Z and Millennials are driving up higher consumer spending the most\n.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nInflation\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEven though inflation is \nslowly easing\n, it’s still relatively high. The high \ninflation \nhas driven up the cost of everyday goods, including groceries and fuel. This, in turn, means that Canadians are spending more per month than they were before 2022, when inflation started to rise.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUnfortunately, workers’ pay hasn’t grown with inflation. This means that the average Canadian simply has less money to spend, increasing their reliance on credit cards to purchase daily necessities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nPent-up demand and travel\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOakes goes on to state that “Pent-up demand and increased travel with the easing of COVID restrictions, combined with soaring inflation, have led to some of the highest increases in credit card spending we’ve ever seen.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt makes sense that Canadians would be eager to travel after several years of travel restrictions, even if it means incurring more credit card debt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nIncreased interest rates\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTo keep inflation under control, the Bank of Canada steadily increased interest rates throughout 2022 and is \ndiscussing more rate hikes this year\n. As the federal interest rate has increased, variable interest rates, such as those offered by credit card companies, have also increased.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThose who carry a credit balance over to the next month must now pay even more interest on their credit card debt, increasing their overall debt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCreating a plan to manage your debt\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccruing debt in the short-term may be inevitable due to high-interest rates and inflation. However, it’s important to create a plan to get your debt under control.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA reliable budget plan paired with consistent action is the best way to get out of debt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRevisit your monthly budget to find areas where you can save, try to pay down high-interest credit card debt as quickly as possible, and consider taking up a side hustle to earn extra money that you can put towards your debt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nChristopher Liew is a CFA Charterholder and former financial advisor.

The CMHC estimates Canada needs nearly six million new homes by 2030, which would require a tripling of the current rate of home building.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMoffat’s message to cabinet? It can be done.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“The politics of this has changed, you can just feel it in the air,” he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I’m hopeful there’s a race to the top between all the different parties to see who can be more credible on housing…I don’t see how you can win the next election if the electorate, particularly anyone under 45, thinks you’re not credible on their number-one issue.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe Offer newsletter: Sign up for complete coverage of Canadian real estate news\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCabinet - and more broadly the Liberals - have their work cut out for them. This summer has seen the Conservatives’ lead over Grits in public opinion polls widen - and younger voters are looking elsewhere. An Abacus Data poll surveying Canadians at the end of July put the Liberals 10 points behind the Conservatives among millennial voters.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt’s no coincidence that same poll showed the top issue for Canadians is cost of living.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor his part, Fraser is promising something tangible soon. When asked if a new housing plan would be presented to Canadians in the fall he replied, “You should expect to see something along those lines for me over the next number of months.” \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

In the number one spot is Calgary-based Paramount Resources Ltd., which saw its share price increase by 1,913 per cent over a three-year period.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCalgary-based NuVista Energy Ltd., another oil and gas exploration and production company, came in second with a share price appreciation of 1,279 per cent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCanada's oil and gas sector enjoyed a resurgence in 2022, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent commodity prices spiking and refocused investor attention on the sector.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We believe (Canadian oil and gas companies) are seen as a source of energy security, with the ongoing energy supply issues that we're seeing globally,\" said Loui Anastasopoulos, CEO of the Toronto Stock Exchange, in an interview.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Through it all, these companies have maintained strong fundamentals and are supported by robust commodity prices.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut the 2023 TSX 30 list also shows how investment capital is increasingly interested in the coming energy transition and alternative, non-fossil fuel forms of energy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSeven of the 30 companies on this year's list are in the mining sector, something Anastasopoulos said is due to a surge of investor interest in critical minerals and metals that are expected to play a key role in the energy transition. Metals and minerals such as copper, lithium and zinc are all seeing increased demand due to their use as components in batteries, electric cars and renewable energy infrastructure.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMontreal-based Aya Gold & Silver Inc., for example, is planning to quadruple its silver production from its Moroccan mining assets to meet growing global demand for solar panels, for which silver is a key component.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company placed 14th on this year's TSX 30 list due to its 498 per cent three-year share price appreciation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe demand for silver is increasing. But at the end of the day, every metal that is related to this energy transition will do very well because the fundamental demand is there,\" said Aya CEO Benoit La Salle in an interview.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"You take a look at how many cars we have now that are electric, and this is just the beginning. The trend is not changing, and the trend is going to push the demand for these metals much higher and therefore the stocks are doing very well.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOut of the seven mining companies on the list, five are included in the S&P/TSX Battery Metals Index and five are in the newly launched S&P/TSX Energy Transition Materials Index.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnastasopoulos said the natural resource industry is and has been a powerhouse for the Canadian economy, and he expects that will continue even as the need to reduce carbon emissions in the face of climate change forces the sector to change and adapt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're very bullish on this trend continuing,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think Canada has a really unique opportunity to be a global leader in energy transition, and the TSX will continue to be a platform that enables these listed companies and investors to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities related to energy transition.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the TSX, the companies featured on the 2023 top 30 list averaged 553 per cent share price appreciation over the last three years, accounting for over $120 billion of value creation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t \n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.5 per cent as the economy struggles to create enough jobs to match the pace of population growth.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe federal agency says job losses last month were led by the construction industry, while the greatest job gains were made in health care and social assistance.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMay served as a turning point in the labour market: the unemployment rate rose for the first time in nine months.

So instead of high interest rates leading to outright job losses, Orlando says the unemployment rate is rising.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"When people come to Canada, even if they don't get a job right away, they're consumers, right? They're looking for housing, they need to buy food, they need to buy clothes. And so they're buying stuff within the economy.

Along with the recent friendly CPI result, we believe that the case for the Bank of Canada moving to the sidelines is now very strong,\" Porter wrote in a client note.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut with underlying price pressures and wage growth still high, Porter said rates may have to stay high for long.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInflation in June fell to 2.8 per cent, within the Bank of Canada's target range of one to three per cent. But core measures of inflation which strip out volatility show prices are still rising quickly and new forecasts from the central bank suggest it expects inflation to get back to two per cent by mid-2025.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe central bank has also raised concerns about the pace of wage growth, noting rapid wage gains would make it challenging to get inflation back to target.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut Orlando says wage growth is a \"lagging indicator,\" meaning workers are getting wage increases to reflect the rapid rise of inflation that already occurred. But falling job vacancies and rising unemployment suggest high wage growth won't persist.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"These are the best indicators that you're not going to get keep wages growing at this five per cent level going forward or into perpetuity, they're going to ease based on the fact that the labour market is clearly loosening,\" Orlando said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nA quick look at Canada's July employment (numbers from the previous month in brackets):\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tUnemployment rate: 5.5 per cent (5.4)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tEmployment rate: 62.0 per cent (62.2)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tParticipation rate: 65.6 per cent (65.7)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tNumber unemployed: 1,166,800 (1,147,100)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tNumber working: 20,166,400 (20,172,800)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tYouth (15-24 years) unemployment rate: 10.2 per cent (11.5)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tMen (25 plus) unemployment rate: 4.6 per cent (4.4)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tWomen (25 plus) unemployment rate: 4.8 per cent (4.4)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nHere's a quick glance at unemployment rates for July, by province:\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tNewfoundland and Labrador 8.7 per cent (8.8)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tPrince Edward Island 8.1 per cent (8.2)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tNova Scotia 7.7 per cent (6.4)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tNew Brunswick 6.2 per cent (6.4)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tQuebec 4.5 per cent (4.4)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tOntario 5.6 per cent (5.7)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tManitoba 4.9 per cent (4.3)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tSaskatchewan 5.1 per cent (4.7)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tAlberta 6.1 per cent (5.7)\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\tBritish Columbia 5.4 per cent (5.6)\n\r\n\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Barriault blamed the positive test for ostarine on tainted supplements with the UFC backing his claim.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency agreed, finding \"no evidence of intentional use,\" and handing down a six-month ban \"consistent with low-level ostarine cases with evidence of contamination.\" Barriault was also suspended for nine months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission, fined US$2,100, and had the Piechota outcome changed to a no-decision.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBarriault won his next two fights before being knocked out in just 16 seconds by American Chidi (Chidi Chidi Bang Bang) Njokuani in February 2022. He rebounded by choking out American Jordan (The Beverly Hills Ninja) Wight in April -- at a catchweight of 190 pounds because he took the fight on short notice -- before the Hernandez bout.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n---\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 18, 2023\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

That is simply not acceptable,\" writes Reverend Dr. Albert Maroun.\n \n \"As Cape Bretoners, we know that something must be done to ensure it stops.\"\n \n Father Maroun knows the needs of international students at Cape Breton University well, because he meets them during lunch. Hundreds depend on the local community kitchen, \nLoaves and Fishes\n, for food.\n \n It’s a community-run kitchen, primarily funded by churches around Cape Breton. The facility was overwhelmed when the university recruited thousands of newcomers in just a few years. They offer up to 250 free meals a day, the majority of them go to foreign students.\n \n  \n \n Sign up for The Informant for insider-only information on W5 investigations\n \n \n Cape Breton University has aggressively ramped up enrollment in the past five years for international students, most of whom are from India.\n \n That’s because students from abroad often pay double what most Canadians do, which has been a saving grace for university budgets across the country.\n \n Today, CBU has 7,300 students on campus, more than 70 per cent of them are international. That’s the highest percentage of international students from the 30 public universities W5 surveyed across the country (see chart below).\n \n \nCBU students board a bus in Sydney, Nova Scotia (W5)\n \n In his letter to the editor, Maroun alleges that the university wants to make money but doesn’t take responsibility for these students.\n \n \"When the steel plant was setting up here over a century ago, they built housing first… maybe CBU should look to the past to see how it is done right.\"\n \n NEWCOMERS STRUGGLING\n \n W5 spoke with dozens of international students, both on the phone and on the ground in Cape Breton.\n \n Many are frustrated by the lack of affordable housing, buses that don’t have enough room for students to get to school, and the challenges of finding part time jobs. But most students were too scared to speak on camera out of fear they would be penalized by the school.\n \n \"I wanted to grab the landing gear and fly back,\" one student tells us, when we agreed to hide her identity.  \"My mind just shut down for about a week after I landed here. It’s so desolate and there's nothing here.\"\n \n This student had studied abroad before, where a transition team at her first university had helped her find accommodations. CBU currently has apartment listings in the community on its website and a dedicated off campus housing coordinator, but this student claims, she was not told anything like that existed and it was difficult to find a place when she arrived.\n \n \"I often wake up at midnight, 3 a.m, 4 a.m… I just know my hair is turning grey,\" she says about the pressure to succeed in Canada.\n \n Before the influx of students, Cape Breton was already facing a severe affordable housing shortage. While there are dorms available on campus, there are no kitchens, so students can’t cook and must purchase a meal plan costing roughly $3,000 a semester.\n \n Damanpreet Singh is CBU’s Student Union President and also an international student who came to Canada in 2021.\n \n \"They should have built kitchens so students could cook, but they didn’t,\" he said. \"They don’t want students cooking in their rooms.\"\n \n He says most students can’t afford to live on campus because many have already taken out personal loans and it’s much cheaper to live in the community. But he also thinks students need to do more research about housing and jobs before coming to Cape Breton.\n \n Another student, who asked to remain anonymous, says he has poured his life savings into this degree, but has struggled to find a place to live. His first rental had rusted out sinks and bathtubs, and mice running around.\n \n \"It’s the most disgusting place I’ve ever been,\" he says. He temporarily moved in with a friend. He says he has lost 20 pounds from all the stress and hasn’t video-called his family since arriving in Canada in early 2023. \"I'm really afraid to Facetime my family because I don’t want them to figure out how terrible I'm looking,\" he said.\n \n \n \n \nInternational students share pictures of some of the housing conditions in Sydney, N.S. (W5)\n \n He also shows us the snow-filled, isolated road he was waiting on to take a bus to school.\n \n \"I was waiting for the bus for one hour,\" he tells us. \"All my shoes, my socks, my pants were all damp.\"\n \n Others tell us, at the beginning of the semester, there weren’t enough seats when the bus arrived. Many said they missed classes because of those delays. In response, CBU has purchased two city buses and added shuttles to help students get to class. But those buses continue to be crowded.\n \n The university largely touts its growth as a success, though it acknowledges there are some growing pains. David Dingwall, the president of CBU, says the university plans to add 240 more beds on campus and is working with the private sector to generate more options in the community.\n \n \"But let's not kid ourselves, housing in every community across the country has grave difficulties and we're no exception,\" Dingwall says.\n \n In 2019, CBU purchased land to develop affordable housing in the community, but no ground has been broken yet. It’s also expanding the dorms to accommodate families coming from abroad and capped certain programs for enrollment.\n \n Here's a list of improvements made by CBU:\n \n  \n \nCBU Continues to Take Action on Housing\n  \n \nOpen Letter to the Cape Breton Community\n  \n \nForever CBU Campaign\n  \n \nCBU Newsroom: Cape Breton University Will Do More\n \n \n 'CANADIAN MAMA' HELPING STUDENTS\n \n Community members are coming to the aid of students. Brenda Matheson from Sydney is one of them. Last year, she started noticing international students, mostly from India, everywhere.\n \n \"My community has become the nicest shade of brown,\" she laughs.\n \n The 61-year-old grandmother is as Cape Breton as they come. You can hear her beautiful laugh and accent a mile away.\n \n That warmth is what drew an international student to her doorstep, begging for a place to live. She says she couldn’t turn him away in the cold. A year later, he still lives with her, rent-free, with another student planning to move in April. From these newcomers, she started to see what was really going on in her community.\n \n \"Kids are sleeping in cars. Kids are sleeping on floors, in people's living rooms, kids are sleeping in laundromats,\" she claims. She says she’s ashamed that so many students pay tens of thousands of dollars to come to Canada to live like this.\n \n Her home has since become a hub for struggling students. Many of her neighbours are also now housing foreign students because of the influx.\n \n \"I think that if you are going to invite thousands of people to any community anywhere on the planet, that maybe you would have lodgings for them, maybe there would be accommodations available, maybe there would be a job for them,\" Brenda says.\n \n \"These kids aren't kids.

TFASA has reportedly held contracts to train Chinese military and civilian pilots in both South Africa and China.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a statement to CTVNews.ca, the South African flight school confirmed that Canadian authorities have reached out to their employees.

Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who succeeded Google co-founder Larry Page in 2019, will be among the most prominent witnesses likely to testify. Court documents also indicate one of Apple's highest-ranking executives, Eddy Cue, might be called to the stand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe case against Google mirrors the one brought against Microsoft in many ways, including the existential threat it poses to a renowned tech giant whose products are relied on by billions of people.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe trial is scheduled to continue into late November before its first phase wraps, after which another round of court filings and arguments are expected. Mehta isn't expected to issue a ruling until early next year. If he decides Google has been breaking the law, it will trigger another trial to determine what measures should be taken to rein in the Mountain View, California, company.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough Google products such as the Chrome web browser, Gmail, YouTube and online maps all are hugely popular, none have become as indispensable -- or as valuable -- as the internet search engine invented by Page and a fellow Stanford University graduate student, Sergey Brin, during the late 1990s.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe trial is beginning just a couple weeks after the 25th anniversary of the first investment in the company -- a $100,000 check written by Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim that enabled Page and Brin to set up shop in a Silicon Valley garage.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tToday, Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., is worth $1.7 trillion and employs 182,000 people, with most of the money coming from $224 billion in annual ad sales flowing through a network of digital services anchored by a search engine that fields billions of queries a day.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGoogle could be hobbled if the antitrust trial culminates in concessions that undercut its power. One possibility is that the company could be forced to stop paying Apple and other companies to make Google the default search engine on smartphones and computers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOr the legal battle could cause Google to lose focus. That's what happened to Microsoft after its antitrust showdown with the Justice Department: Distracted, the software giant struggled to adapt to the impact of internet search and smartphones. Google capitalized on that distraction to leap from its startup roots into an imposing powerhouse.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNearly three years after filing its antitrust lawsuit during the Trump administration, lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department will try to prove Google has been abusing the power of its search engine to stifle competition in ways that discouraged innovation. Critics say the quality of search results has deteriorated, too, as Google used its engine to sell ads and promote its own products, like Google restaurant reviews instead of those offered by Yelp.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDozens of state attorneys general, led by Colorado, have waded into the battle and will have a chance to prove Google turned into an illegal monopoly that's harming consumers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe crux of the Justice Department's argument will boil down to its contention that Google's search engine has become like digital air almost everyone breathes, and that it needs to be cleaned up because the company's tactics have polluted the atmosphere.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGoogle's vast legal team is expected to counter that the company has never stopped improving its search engine, executing its original mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible to anyone with an internet connection. From Google's perspective, the perpetual improvements explain why most people almost reflexively gravitate to its search engine, a habit that long ago made \"Googling\" synonymous with looking things up.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDespite commanding about 90 per cent of the internet search market, Google argues it faces a wide range of competition ranging from other search engines such as Microsoft's Bing and DuckDuckGo to websites such as Amazon and Yelp, where people research questions about what product to buy or where to eat.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Justice Department contends Google's claim that it dominates the market by supplying the best search engine is a canard. They allege Google protects its franchise through a form of payola, shelling out billions of dollars annually to be the default search engine on the iPhone and web browser such as Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRegulators also allege Google has illegally rigged the market in its favour by requiring its search engine to be bundled with its Android software for smartphones if the device manufacturers want full access to the Android app store.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBy locking in Google's search engine as the default choice in so many places, the Justice Department contends the company has made it more difficult for people to find the best results as quickly as possible.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRegulators allege the company's deals ensure Google's automatic access to billions of queries that provide data for its search engine, while boxing out Bing and DuckDuckGo from getting information that could help them improve their results.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe tactics have created a toxic situation allowing Google to cram more ads at the top of its search results, increasing its profits and Alphabet's stock price, according to the Justice Department. That practice requires consumers to dig ever deeper to answer their questions, something that regulators believe could be avoided if rival services were able to collect as much information as Google does through its lock-in agreements.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGoogle insists that consumers could easily switch their default settings to another search engine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company also argues that it does face competition from evolving technology: Microsoft, for example, is baking artificial intelligence from its business partner Open AI into its Bing search engine. That move in early February prodded Google to start equipping its search engine with AI-fueled results too -- a sign that the company says shows competition continues to thrive.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He said it all came down to Royals reliever Carlos Hernandez putting a fastball down the middle.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I'm the kind of hitter that I don't really like to swing on 3-0,\" Guerrero said via interpreter Hector Lebron. \"That was the perfect scenario for me though with runners on base.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I said, 'Well, you know what, if he comes right here, I'm going to swing at it.'\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBo Bichette drove in two runs with a single and a double for Toronto (78-63) in his first game since Aug. 27.

Game by game.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tStarter Yusei Kikuchi had eight strikeouts over five innings for Toronto, allowing one run on three hits and a walk. Jordan Hicks, Trevor Richards, Chad Green (2-0), Tim Mayza, and Jordan Romano of Markham, Ont., came out of Toronto's bullpen.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRomano recorded four outs for his 33rd save of the season.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDairon Blanco had a home run for Kansas City (44-98) and Nick Loftin added an RBI triple. Edward Olivares drove in a run with a fielder's choice and Salvador Perez had a late RBI single.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Royals had a bullpen day, with Collin Snider serving as opener before Alec Marsh, Austin Cox, Carlos Hernandez (1-10), and Tucker Davidson came to the mound.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBlanco opened the scoring for Kansas City in the third inning. Hitting at the bottom of the Royals lineup, it was just his second homer of the season.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMore impressively, it was only the second home run Kikuchi has allowed in his nine starts since the all-star break. Only New York Mets starter Jose Quintana has allowed fewer in that span among pitchers with at least 50 innings pitched.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Credit to him, he's really, really turned it on in the second half,\" said Toronto manager John Schneider. \"He's been as consistent as anyone the entire year.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKikuchi gave up a soft bunt to Freddy Fermin to start the fifth but was dialed in after that, striking out Loftin, Kyle Isbel, and Blanco to end the inning.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Every inning I thought my fastball was getting better and better,\" said Kikuchi via interpreter Yusuke Oshima. \"I think I used my fastball really effectively today.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKevin Kiermaier led off the sixth for the Blue Jays with a triple, sliding to avoid the tag. Two batters later, Bichette hit a double down the first-base line to tie the game 1-1.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt looked like Loftin would be the final out of the seventh as Toronto right-fielder George Springer tracked down the ball near the foul line but his attempt at a sliding catch was mistimed, with the ball bouncing off his glove.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat allowed Loftin to safely reach third as Fermin crossed home for a 2-1 Royals lead.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCox had to be removed from the game in the bottom of the seventh after a scary injury. The relief pitcher was running to first base on a ground ball but planted his left foot badly, apparently twisting his knee and immediately dropping to the turf in agony.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlejandro Kirk reached base on the play with Tyler Heineman then pinch running for him. Springer drew a walk to bring Bichette back to the plate. His single to left field scored Heineman.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGuerrero was next up and he made no mistake, hitting his double to bring home Springer and Bichette for Toronto's first lead of the game.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tClement tacked on another run with a single, pushing Guerrero across the plate for a 5-2 Blue Jays lead.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOlivares chipped away at that lead for Kansas City in the eighth, hitting into a fielder's choice to score Bobby Witt Jr., when Clement tried to turn a double play to end the inning.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWith two on and two out in the ninth, Perez singled to score Isbel and pull the Royals within a run.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tON DECK — Blue Jays ace Kevin Gausman (10-8) will get the start in Saturday's matinee.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tZack Greinke (1-14) is scheduled to pitch for the Royals.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 8, 2023. \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The solution, he argues, is to introduce legislation soon after the House of Commons resumes that aims to help ease the cost of living and housing concerns.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There's a lot of criticism of the Liberals' inability to communicate. But before you have good communication, you have to have strong policy that's easily translated, easily understood,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMacEachern added that polling data has riled up MPs, who can't imagine losing to a party that is campaigning on resentment and anger that Liberals feel is reminiscent of the former Reform and Canadian Alliance parties -- predecessors to the modern Conservative party.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The thought of losing to a party that (they feel) is going to take Canada backwards, it is concerning,\" said MacEachern, who this month launched his own lobby firm, KAN Strategies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor example, he said Liberals felt a visceral reaction to images of Poilievre at the Calgary Stampede posing in July with a man wearing a T-shirt bearing the words \"straight pride.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPoilievre's office said the leader hadn't read what was on the shirt and didn't support its message, which is widely seen as bigoted. But MacEachern said it's the type of incident that jolts Liberals into action.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis week's caucus meeting kicked off Tuesday with gatherings of small caucus groups, including women, Indigenous and rural MPs. Wednesday and Thursday will feature meetings in regional and national groupings.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMPs will also have a chance to touch base through various receptions and dinners, and they're expected to speak with reporters between the events.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Liberal caucus chair, Quebec MP Brenda Shanahan, said midday Tuesday that MPs were already talking about what their constituents have flagged as problems, so the party can sort out how to tackle them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're having very frank, very open discussions,\" she said in an interview.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're doing the work, and it just needs to get delivered in a way that's more effective and where Canadians are feeling the impact.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tYet some MPs feel the Liberals' current plans are working, and that they just need to better sell their platform to the public and wait for economic problems like inflation to subside.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEnvironment Minister Steven Guilbeault argued last week that the Liberals can turn things around by sticking with existing plans to ramp up social supports, such as dental care and daycare.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We believe that we will be in a better position in the coming months,\" he told reporters gathered outside the Conservative party convention in Quebec City.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There are good signs, but we need to keep working hard to ensure that with Canadians, we make it through this tough patch.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShanahan said there will be some guests at the caucus, but no big-name speakers. She noted London Mayor Josh Morgan will make welcoming remarks at a reception.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMacEachern said London is a strategic choice for the Liberals as it includes demographics they will need to court to win key ridings, such as young families seeking child care, as well as university students of voting age.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTrudeau was expected to arrive in Ottawa late Tuesday night, after a mechanical issue delayed his departure from the G20 summit in New Delhi. That would allow him to attend the larger caucus meetings, including when the vast majority of Liberal MPs will be in one room.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

But given X's mute function, \"I think it becomes harder and harder to justify outright blocking of individuals.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Treasury Board Secretariat had no immediate comment on the court order's implications.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Review Board that is responsible for managing the person's care including where they will stay and under what conditions they could be allowed out in public.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEach case is reviewed periodically until the review board either discharges the person completely, or finds that a previously unfit accused is now fit to stand trial and should be returned to court.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPublic statistics from the board show that the total number of accused under the board's jurisdiction has declined over the last four years and sat at 256 people in 2021-2022. There are slightly more accused in custody at the Forensic Psychiatric Hospital than under supervision in the community.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn 2008, a B.C. Supreme Court judge said Donnelly, a devotedly religious man, believed that God wanted him to murder his wife and daughter and interpreted multiple innocuous events leading up to the girl's killing as signs. They included his dog playing with a certain chew toy, and a friend choking on a cup of tea.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe was sent to the Coquitlam facility, but Eby said he was released in 2009, attacked someone else, then was released again before Sunday's attack.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I cannot fathom how someone who murdered his daughter was released in 2009, went out and stabbed somebody else, would then be released again, unaccompanied, somehow able to go out and buy a knife, go to Chinatown and stab three people. How is that possible?” Eby said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEby said he wants to assure the victims, their families and all others affected by the stabbing that his government will determine how it happened and do everything possible to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA man and woman in their 60s and a woman in her 20s suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries in Sunday's attack.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a statement, the festival organizers say Light Up Chinatown! “served as a beautiful and vibrant celebration” of the neighbourhood.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“The senseless act that transpired is nothing short of devastating and heartbreaking.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The fact that this is a fan-voted award means so much to me,\" Swift said in her acceptance speech. \"I can't believe it was a year ago that I announced the `Midnights' album.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe show, held at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, was Swift's from nearly the beginning. The night's first presenters were none other than NSYNC, who reunited to hand the best pop video award to Swift.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn coordinating suits, Justin Timberlake, Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez shared the stage with Swift. Bass handed her a friendship bracelet, just as fans do at the superstar's shows. \"You're pop personified,\" she told the group.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe night's top nominee later returned to the stage to pick up the song of the year trophy for \"Anti-Hero\" and also the best direction award.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSwift took home nine of the 11 awards she was up for, including artist of the year in a category made up entirely of women nominees for the first time in VMA history.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHer \"Karma (Remix)\" collaborator, Ice Spice, won best new artist. \"Oh my God, this is so cool,\" she said. \"I just want to thank my munchkins.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNew music was abundant throughout the show. Host Nicki Minaj performed her latest single, the dreamy \"Last Time I Saw You\" before jumping into a brand-new tease of a fiery new trap cut from her highly-anticipated \"Pink Friday 2\" album.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I ain't nothing like you,\" she raps, \"I'm on a whole other level.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs much as Swift dominated, the VMAs centred on music's global power. K-pop boy band Tomorrow X Together and Brazilian superstar Anitta premiered their new collaboration, the glossy retro-pop of \"Back for More.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnother K-pop group, Stray Kids, brought \"S-Class\" to the stage, regional Mexicana star Peso Pluma performed \"Lady Gaga\" and reggaetonera Karol G delivered \"Oki Doki\" and \"Ta OK (remix),\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tComedian Tiffany Haddish presented the award for \"Best Afrobeats\" in the category's inaugural year, given to Rema and Selena Gomez for their massive hit \"Calm Down.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Africa in the house!\" Rema started his acceptance speech. \"Shout out to Fela (Kuti) who started Afrobeats in the first placeΓÇªand I want to give a big shout out to the next generation of Afrobeats.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGomez stood a few feet from the microphone but jumped in when Rema asked her to, telling the crowd: \"I want to send all of my love to Nigeria, thank you.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tColombian icon Shakira received the Video Vanguard Award and performed an incredible bilingual medley of her decades of hits -- \"She Wolf,\" her collaboration with Rauw Alejandro \"Te Felicito,\" the viral, record-breaking \"Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\" with Bizarrap among them -- in a set introduced by her \"Hips Don't Lie\" collaborator Wyclef Jean.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"MTV, thank you for being such a big part of my career since I was only 18 years old,\" Shakira said, also thanking her parents and her children, who she brought to the show.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"This is for you my people, my Latin American people, inside and outside this country,\" she said, switching to Spanish. \"Thank you for inspiring me and for injecting me with so much strength and so much desire to move forward, I love you so much.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe also took home the award for best collaboration for \"TQG,\" her song with Karol G. The duo gave their acceptance speech entirely in Spanish. \"If collaborating with the legendary Shakira had been impressive, having an award with her is something from another planet,\" Karol G exclaimed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDiddy received the Global Icon Award from Mary J. Blige and his daughter Chance Combs. He is third recipient of the award, following the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2022 and the Foo Fighters in 2021.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe legendary rapper also performed at the VMAs for the first time since 2005. It was an incredible collection of some of his biggest hits like \"Bad Boy for Life\" and \"Mo Money Mo Problems,\" joined by some of his greatest collaborators: Yung Miami, Keyshia Cole, and sweetest of all, his son, King Combs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Love wins, y'all, love wins,\" he started his speech. \"I started out as a paper boy, I didn't know I was going to be here.\" He then led the audience with a chant of \"bad boy.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"This is for 30 years,\" he continued. \"I pray to God that you get to do what you love for 30 years.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLil Wayne opened the show with a performance of his new single \"Kat Food.\" Immediately afterward, Olivia Rodrigo brought her \"Vampire\" music video set to the stage, before launching into her cheeky pop-punk single \"Get Him Back!\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBetween the two tracks, snippets of her sold singles played aloud -- at the same moment, she was rushed from the staged in a pre-planned \"malfunction,\" further mirroring the \"Vampire\" video and symbolizing a move from her first record to her second.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe live sets were many: Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion brought \"Bongos\" to life with big choreography; Demi Lovato played a rock `n' roll medley of her biggest hits: \"Heart Attack,\" into \"Sorry Not Sorry,\" \"Cool for the Summer\" before the best K-pop award was given to Stray Kids.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLater, Anitta would win the \"best Latin\" award for the second year in a row, delivering one of the more endearing acceptance speeches of the night -- \"I wanna thank myself,\" she laughed. \"Because I work so hard!\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFrench Montana used his position as best R&B presenter alongside Ashanti to draw attention to Morocco earthquake relief, spotlighting a relief fund that he said he would personally donate to. Montana grew up in Morocco.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNear the end of the show, the MTV Video Music Awards celebrated 50 years of hip-hop with a star-studded finale performance.

The 4K restoration “Stop Making Sense” opens Sept. 22.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe screening and Q-and-A on Monday were beamed live to theatres around the world, and Lee read out a question submitted by a viewer in Montreal who wanted to know what films inspired the visual aspects.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tByrne said there wasn’t much in Demme’s films that inspired them visually.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"He was aware of how people relate to one another and he brought that to a concert movie, which you don't see in every kind of concert movie,” said Byrne.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I remember when we were thinking about this, I'd looked at whatever concert movies and things I could at the time. I remember looking at a Neil Young one called ‘Rust Never Sleeps' where he had giant amps. I thought 'Hey, that's pretty good.'\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLee, who directed the 2020 film version of Byrne’s Broadway show “American Utopia,” asked about the famous oversized blazer and slacks that Byrne wears for part of the show.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tByrne said the idea struck him while having dinner in Japan after the tour. A Japanese designer told him: “Well, David, in the theatre, everything is bigger than real life.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“He was referring to, like, gestures, and you sing louder and all that, and I'm thinking, ‘Oh, my suit should be bigger too,” Byrne said to laughter.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNot missing a beat, Frantz gestured to the massive Imax screen behind them: “It was really big tonight.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTIFF runs until Sept. 17.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 11, 2023. \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

At least two people have been killed in the U.S. and Canada, and seven others have been hurt as a result of defective ARC inflators, the agency said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe recall would cover a large portion of the 284 million vehicles now on U.S. roads, but the percentage is difficult to determine. Some have ARC inflators for both the driver and front passenger.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a letter posted Friday, the agency told ARC that it has tentatively concluded after an eight-year investigation that ARC front driver and passenger inflators have a safety defect.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Air bag inflators that project metal fragments into vehicle occupants, rather than properly inflating the attached air bag, create an unreasonable risk of death and injury,\" Stephen Ridella, director of NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation, wrote in a letter to ARC.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut ARC responded that it no defect exists in the inflators, and that any problems are related to isolated manufacturing issues.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe next step in the process is for NHTSA to schedule a public hearing. It could then take the company to court to force a recall.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We disagree with NHTSA's new sweeping request when extensive field testing has found no inherent defect,\" ARC said in a statement Friday night.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlso Friday, NHTSA posted documents showing that General Motors is recalling nearly 1 million vehicles equipped with ARC inflators. The recall covers certain 2014-2017 Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse, and GMC Acadia SUVs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe automaker says an inflator explosion \"may result in sharp metal fragments striking the driver or other occupants, resulting in serious injury or death.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOwners will be notified by letter starting June 25, but no fix is available yet. They'll get another letter when one is ready.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGM says it will offer \"courtesy transportation\" on a case-by-case basis to owners who fear driving vehicles that are part of the recall.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company said that it's doing the recall, which expands previous actions, \"out of an abundance of caution and with the safety of our customers as our highest priority.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of the two deaths was a mother of 10 who was killed in what appeared to be an otherwise minor crash in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in the summer of 2021. Police reports show that a metal inflator fragment hit her neck in a crash involving a 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt least a dozen automakers have the allegedly faulty inflators in use, including Volkswagen, Ford, BMW and GM, NHTSA said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe agency contends that welding debris from the manufacturing process can block an \"exit orifice\" for gas that is released to fill the air bag in a crash. Any blockage can cause pressure to build in the inflator, blowing it apart and hurling metal fragments, Ridella's letter says.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut in a response to Ridella dated May 11, ARC Vice President of Product Integrity Steve Gold wrote that NHTSA's position is not based on any objective technical or engineering conclusion about a defect, \"but rather conclusory statements regarding hypothesized blockage of the inflator orifice from `weld slag.\"'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe wrote that welding debris has not been confirmed as the cause in any of the seven inflator ruptures in the U.S. ARC contends that only five have ruptured while in use, and that \"does not support a finding that a systemic and prevalent defect exists in this population.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGold also writes that manufacturers must do recalls, not equipment manufacturers like ARC. NHTSA's recall demand, he wrote, exceeds the agency's legal authority.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a federal lawsuit filed last year, plaintiffs alleged that ARC's inflators use ammonium nitrate as a secondary propellant to inflate the air bags. The propellant is pressed into tablets that can expand and develop microscopic holes if exposed to moisture. Degraded tablets have a larger surface area, causing them to burn too fast and ignite too big of an explosion, according to the lawsuit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe explosion can blow apart a metal canister housing the chemical, sending metal shards into the cabin. Ammonium nitrate, used in fertilizer and as a cheap explosive, is so dangerous that it can burn too fast even without moisture present, the lawsuit says.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe plaintiffs allege that ARC inflators have blown apart seven times on U.S. roads and two other times in testing by ARC. There have so far been five limited recalls of the inflators that totaled about 5,000 vehicles, including three recalls by GM.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis story has updated to clarify that the portion of U.S. vehicles on the road would be less than the one quarter because some vehicles have ARC driver and passenger inflators.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Actors Halle Berry, Blake Lively, Tiffany Haddish, Ellen Pompeo, Olivia Wilde, Jenna Dewan and many more were in attendance.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"All of us dream of holidays,\" the designer said before the show, explaining the inspiration for a collection projecting a beach-going vibe, with Burt Bacharach favourites like \"What the World Needs Now\" and \"Promises, Promises\" on the soundtrack. \"I wanted to have this sort of barefoot glamour.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop entertainment headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut the designer was thinking most of all about his mother, the late Joan Kors, who died in August at 84. A former Revlon model, she was a strong influence on her son throughout his life, he has said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"My mother truly was my ultimate muse, my ultimate supporter,\" Kors said. \"She and I traveled the world together and I have so many incredible memories of holidays with her. And she was a woman who broke the rules. She wore hot pants to the office. I think she always had fun with fashion and she really knew herself.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe runway was heavy on looks one imagined Kors' mother might have worn in the '60s and '70s, including some very short minidresses and chiffon sundresses. Many items were in cotton and cashmere crochet or in lace.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAsked about his hefty celebrity contingent, Kors noted he was a big fan of movies, theatre and music. Although he outfits many of them for red carpets, he added he felt extra satisfaction when he saw celebrities dress in his designs in more routine settings. \"The biggest compliment is when someone wears something of mine on everyday sort of basis.\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKors also addressed changes to his business. Tapestry, parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, recently announced it was buying Capri Holdings, owner of Michael Kors as well as Versace and Jimmy Choo, for about US$8.5 billion -- making it one of the world's largest luxury companies and putting it in position to compete with European rivals like LVMH and Kering.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're excited at the prospect of joining forces with Tapestry,\" Kors said of the consolidation, \"and combining and pooling our resources and knowledge to accelerate the growth. I think it's fantastic.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Its aggressive rate hike cycle over the last year is starting to slow the economy by forcing people and businesses to pull back on spending.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs the economy slows, economists worry excessive or untargeted measures by the federal government could work against the central bank's efforts and force it to raise interest rates even higher.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFinance Minister Chrystia Freeland has said repeatedly that she's committed to fiscal restraint and ensuring the federal government doesn't make the Bank of Canada's job harder.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut the Liberals are also facing pressure from New Democrats to continue providing support for low-income Canadians who are hardest hit by inflation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he wants to see the government extend the six-month boost to the GST rebate, introduced last fall, which temporarily doubled the amount people received.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt a news conference Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau didn't weigh in on whether his government would extend the rebate, but said the budget will include affordability measures.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"In our budget, we are going to be putting forward measures that will directly help Canadians,\" Trudeau said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInflation has become a top political and economic concern in the country after a significant runup in prices last year, driven in part by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and mangled supply chains.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut since peaking at 8.1 per cent last summer, Canada's inflation rate has been steadily declining as global pressures on inflation ease and high interest rates weigh on the economy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJean said lower gas prices last month likely drove the headline inflation rate down further. Other components of the CPI, like food prices, probably didn't ease by much.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGrocery prices in January were a staggering 11.4 per cent higher than they were a year ago.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRBC economist Carrie Freestone said businesses, including grocers, have been able to pass on the extra costs they're facing from suppliers to consumers. But grocery prices are still expected to ease as lower agricultural commodity prices feed through the supply chain.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's just seems to be taking a bit of time,\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Bank of Canada is currently holding its key interest rate steady at 4.5 per cent, hoping inflation will ease without the need for more rate hikes. It's forecasting inflation will fall to about three per cent by mid-year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"As long as inflation continues to trend lower as we expect ... (the Bank of Canada) will probably stay on the sidelines,\" Freestone said.For workers who haven't seen their wages keep up with inflation, the rapid rise has been especially punishing. But as inflation slows, the gap between the two is narrowing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn February, average hourly wages were up 5.4 per cent, matching forecasts for inflation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Bank of Canada has said persistently strong wage growth will make getting back to the two per cent inflation target difficult.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor workers, Jean said the narrowing gap between inflation and wage growth is good news, but doesn't make up for what they've lost.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're not talking about making up for the last two years of wage growth not keeping up with inflation,\" Jean said. \"We're just stopping the hemorrhage here.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Flemming Madsen of the Danish Joint Arctic Command told The Associated Press that the passengers and crew on the ship stranded in northwestern Greenland were doing fine and \"all I can say is that they got a lifetime experience.\"\n \n  \n \nNightly Briefing newsletter: Sign up for coverage of the day’s most compelling news\n \n \n The scientific fishing vessel was scheduled to arrive later Wednesday and would attempt when the conditions were right to pull the 104.4-metre- (343-foot) long and 18-metre- (60-foot) wide MV Ocean Explorer free.\n \n The cruise ship ran aground Monday in Alpefjord in the Northeast Greenland National Park, which is known for icebergs and the musk oxen that roam the coast. The crew made two failed attempts to get the ship to float free on its own during high tide.\n \n In a statement, Australia-based Aurora Expeditions, which operates the ship, said the passengers and crew members were safe and well and that there was \"no immediate danger to themselves, the vessel, or the surrounding environment.\"\n \n \"We are actively engaged in efforts to free the MV Ocean Explorer from its grounding. Our foremost commitment is to ensure the vessel's recovery without compromising safety,\" the statement said.\n \n \nAn aerial photo shows the Ocean Explorer, a Bahamas-flagged Norwegian cruise ship with 206 passengers and crew, which has run aground in northwestern Greenland, on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2023. (Danish Air Force/Joint Arctic Command via AP)\n \n Located across from the ice sheet that covers the world's largest island, Alpefjord sits in a remote corner of Greenland, some 240 kilometres (149 miles) away from the closest settlement, Ittoqqortoormiit, which itself is nearly 1,400 kilometres (870 miles) from the country's capital, Nuuk.\n \n Dozens of cruise ships sail along Greenland's coast every year so passengers can admire the picturesque mountainous landscape with fjords, the waterways packed with icebergs of different sizes and glaciers jutting out into the sea.\n \n Madsen, of Denmark's Joint Arctic Command, said the passengers on the Ocean Explorer were \"a mix\" of tourists from Australia, New Zealand, Britain, the United States and South Korea. Greenland is a semi-independent territory that is part of the Danish realm, as are the Faeroe Islands.\n \n The people onboard \"are in a difficult situation, but given the circumstances, the atmosphere on the ship is good, and everyone on board is doing well. There are no signs that the ship was seriously damaged by the grounding,\" the Joint Arctic Command said Wednesday.\n \n The Ocean Explorer was built in 2021 and is owned by Copenhagen SunStone Ships, which is part of Denmark's SunStone Group. It has an inverted bow, shaped like the one on a submarine. It has 77 cabins, 151 passenger beds and 99 beds for crew, and several restaurants, according to the Sunstone Group website.\n \n The Joint Arctic Command said there were other ships in the vicinity of the stranded cruise liner and \"if the need arises, personnel from the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol can be at the accident site within an hour and a half.\".\n \n On Tuesday, members of the Sirius Dog Sled Patrol, a Danish naval unit that conducts long-range reconnaissance and enforces Danish sovereignty in the Arctic wilderness, visited the passengers and explained the situation, \"which calmed them down as some were anxious,\" Madsen, who was the on-duty officer for the Joint Arctic Command, said.\n \n The command, which was coordinating the operation to free the cruise ship, said the nearest Danish navy ship was about 1,200 nautical miles (more than 2,000 kilometres or 1,380 miles) away. It was heading to the site and could be expected to reach the grounded ship as soon as Friday.\n \n The primary mission of the Joint Arctic Command is to ensure Danish sovereignty by monitoring the area around the Faeroe Islands and Greenland, including the Arctic Ocean in the north.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The country's president has largely ceremonial powers, and there is no firm, written constitution.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe case that opened Tuesday focuses on the first law passed by parliament in July -- a measure that cancels the court's ability to strike down government moves it deems to be \"unreasonable.\" Judges have used the legal standard in rare cases to prevent government decisions or appointments viewed as unsound or corrupt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe hearing puts Israel's Supreme Court in the unprecedented position of deciding whether to accept limits on its own powers. In a sign of the case's significance, all 15 justices are hearing the appeal together for the first time in the country's history, rather than the typical smaller panels. The proceedings were also livestreamed and aired on the country's main TV stations.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA ruling is not expected for weeks or even months, but the session Tuesday could hint at the court's direction. The marathon hearing was largely businesslike, though at times the arguments became tense and heated.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn one exchange, Simcha Rothman, a senior government lawmaker who has shepherded the overhaul through parliament, insisted the court could not be trusted to decide its own fate.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Can you be the ones to judge this without fear, without prejudice, without bias? Because you are dealing with your own honour and status,\" Rothman told the chief justice. \"And you talk about the Knesset's conflict of interest?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSupreme Court Chief Justice Esther Hayut chided him, responding that the court does not deal with its own status but rather \"the essential interests of the public.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn another exchange, Justice Isaac Amit challenged a lawyer representing Netanhayu's coalition who said the new law doesn't endanger democracy. \"Democracy doesn't die from few strong blows. Democracy dies in series of small steps,\" said Amit, who is expected to succeed Hayut as chief justice after she retires later this year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNetanyahu has not said whether he would respect a decision by the court to strike down the new law. Some members of his coalition have hinted that the government could ignore the court's decision.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLegal experts warn that could spark a constitutional crisis, where citizens and the country's security forces are left to decide whose orders to follow -- the parliament's or the court's.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe political survival of Netanyahu, who returned to power late last year while standing trial on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges, is also bound up with the overhaul. His hard-line, religiously conservative coalition partners have threatened to rebel if he doesn't see the legislation through, and critics say Netanyahu could use the overhaul to get the charges against him dismissed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe plan has infuriated people across many segments of Israeli society. Hundreds of thousands poured into the streets in repeated mass protests for the past 36 weeks.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We stand here today with millions of citizens to stop the government coup,\" said Eliad Shraga, chairman of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, one of the groups that asked the court to strike down the new law. \"Together we will preserve Israeli democracy.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut it has also exposed an enormous gulf in Israel.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOpponents of the plan come largely from the country's secular middle class. Leading high-tech business figures have threatened to relocate. Perhaps most dramatic, thousands of military reservists have broken with the government and declared their refusal to report for duty over the plan.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNetanyahu's supporters tend to be poorer, more religious and live in West Bank settlements or outlying rural areas. Many are working-class Mizrahi Jews, with roots in Middle Eastern countries, and have expressed hostility toward what they say is an elitist, secular class of Ashkenazi, or European, Jews.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs the hearing got underway, a couple dozen right-wing activists came out to protest at the entrance to the Supreme Court. \"The people are the sovereign!\" they shouted through megaphones, blowing horns and holding signs declaring that they had voted for Netanyahu, not Justice Hayut.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe night before, tens of thousands of anti-government protesters rallying against the judicial overhaul flooded the streets near the court, waving national flags and chanting for democracy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe law under review was passed as an amendment to what in Israel is known as a \"Basic Law,\" a special piece of legislation that serves as a sort of constitution. The court has never struck down a \"Basic Law\" before but says it has the right to do so. The government says it does not.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJustice Minister Yariv Levin, the chief architect of the overhaul, said the court \"lacks all authority\" to review the law.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It is a fatal blow to democracy and the status of the Knesset,\" he said. He insisted lawmakers elected by the people should have the final say over such legislation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile the attorney general would typically represent the government in such a hearing, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara has expressed staunch opposition to the overhaul.

The companies had been asking for subsidies that matched those provided in the United States under its new Inflation Reduction Act.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs part of the deal, the federal government upped the subsidy cap to $15 billion. A separate deal with Volkswagen for a plant in St. Thomas, Ont. for about $14 billion.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA cost-sharing agreement will offload a third of the total costs onto the Ontario government, about $9.4 billion.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt the time the Volkswagen deal was made, Canada’s prime minister said they would break even in less than five years. No timeline was provided following the deal with Stellantis.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe PBO analysis notes there is “uncertainty surrounding the future geographic location of investments and production” within the EV supply chain. This could impact the timeline further, Giroux noted.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeaking to reporters Tuesday afternoon, Federal Minister of Innovation, Science, and Industry Francois-Philippe Champagne said he welcomed the report, adding that its findings “confirmed that the deals that we've made are good deals for Canadians, that they're going to pay dividends for decades to come.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen asked about the gap in timeline estimates, Champagne said the PBO failed to account for the full economic impact.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“So clearly, if you look at the rest of it, which is the vast majority, you come to a different number, a much shorter payback,” the minister said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAn earlier analysis by the PBO also found that the deal with Volkswagen \ncould end up costing the federal government closer to $16 billion\n due to upfront capital investments.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe battery plants were highly sought by all level of governments, as they are expected to bring thousands of jobs to the province as well as support auto manufacturing supply chains and related sectors.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a statement issued Tuesday, the federal minister of innovation, science and economic development said the analysis “demonstrates that the Stellantis-LGES and Volkswagen investments are good deals for Canadians, the auto sector and our workers.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“While the Parliamentary Budget Officer’s report does not capture many of the broader economic impacts on the supply chain, it does highlight, once again, that these investments will generate economic benefits far greater than our government’s contributions,” Francois-Philippe Champagne said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHowever Ontario interim Liberal Leader John Fraser called the timeline “concerning,” noting that a lot can happen in 20 years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“When you look at what the PBO has laid out, and what governments are saying, they don't connect. That's a problem,” Fraser said. “They're making a massive investment on behalf of the people. People should have transparency. It would have been good to know that it's going to take 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, and what the risks are.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Twenty years is a long time.

Waves rose as high as 7 metres (23 feet), Yann Fridez, head of the delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Libya, told broadcaster France24.\n \n Mohammed Derna, a teacher in the city, said he, his family and neighbours rushed to the roof of their apartment building, stunned at the volume of water rushing by. It reached the second story of many buildings, he said. They watched people below, including women and children being washed away.\n \n \"They were screaming, help, help,\" he said over the phone from a field hospital in Derna. \"It was like a Hollywood horror movie.\"\n \n Derna lies on a narrow coastal plain on the Mediterranean Sea, under steep mountains running along the coast. Only two roads from the south remain usable, and they involve a long, winding route through the mountains.\n \n \nWorkers bury the bodies of victims of recent flooding caused by Mediterranean storm Daniel near the city of Derna, Libya, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023. Thousands of bodies have been recovered in the days since the storm hit, and many more are still missing, particularly in the worst-hit city of Derna, where two dams burst as a result of the heavy rainfall. (AP Photo/Yousef Murad)\n \n Aid teams with some supplies managed to get in that way, while authorities in eastern Libya worked Wednesday to repair the faster coastal access routes.\n \n Otherwise, local emergency workers were relying on whatever equipment they already had on hand. Search teams combed shattered apartment buildings and retrieved the dead floating offshore in the Mediterranean Sea, al-Falah said. Collapsed bridges the river split the city center, further hampering movement.\n \n Ossama Ali, a spokesman for the Ambulance and Emergency Center in eastern Libya, said at least 5,100 deaths were recorded in Derna, along with around 100 others elsewhere in eastern Libya. More than 7,000 people were injured in the city, most receiving treatment in field hospitals that authorities and aid agencies set up, he told The Associated Press by phone Wednesday.\n \n The number of deaths is likely to increase since teams are still collecting bodies from the streets, buildings and the sea, he said. At least 9,000 remain missing, but that number could drop as communications are restored, Ali said.\n \n At least 30,000 people in Derna were displaced by the flooding, the UN's International Organization for Migration said, adding that the city remained almost inaccessible for humanitarian aid workers.\n \n The startling devastation pointed to the storm's intensity, but also Libya's vulnerability. The country is divided by rival governments, one in the east, the other in the west, and the result has been neglect of infrastructure in many areas.\n \n  \n \nClimate Barometer newsletter: Sign up for more on how a warming planet impacts you\n \n \n  \n \nTop climate and environment headlines, all in one place\n \n \n \"This is a disaster in every sense of the word,\" a wailing survivor who lost 11 members of his family told a local television station as a group of rescuers tried to calm him. The television station did not identify the survivor.\n \n Ahmed Abdalla, a survivor who joined the search and rescue effort, said they were putting bodies in the yard of a local hospital before taking them for burial in mass graves at Derna's sole intact cemetery.\n \n \"The situation is indescribable. Entire families dead in this disaster. Some were washed away to the sea,\" Abdalla said by phone from Derna.\n \n Bulldozers worked over the past two days to fix and clear roads to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid and heavy equipment. Derna is 250 kilometres (150 miles) east of Benghazi, where international aid started to arrive on Tuesday.\n \n Libya's neighbours, Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia, as well as Turkiye and the United Arab Emirates, sent rescue teams and aid. President Joe Biden also said the United States is sending emergency funds to relief organizations and coordinating with the Libyan authorities and the United Nations to provide additional support.\n \n Mohammed Abu-Lamousha, a spokesman for the eastern Libyan interior ministry, on Tuesday put the death tally in Derna at more than 5,300, according to the state-run news agency. Dozens of others were reported dead in other towns in eastern Libya, he said.\n \n Authorities have transferred hundreds of bodies to morgues in nearby towns. More than 300, including 84 Egyptians, were brought to the morgue in the city of Tobruk, 169 kilometres (105 miles) east of Derna, the local Medical Center reported.\n \n The victims' lists reflected how Libya, despite its turmoil, was always a magnet for workers from around the region because of its oil industry.\n \n More than 70 of Derna's dead all hailed from a single southern Egyptian village, el-Sharif. On Wednesday morning, hundreds attended a mass funeral in the village for 64 repatriated bodies. Rabei Hefny said his extended family lost 16 men in the flooding, 12 of whom were buried Wednesday. Another funeral for four others was held in a town in the northern Nile Delta.\n \n Among those killed in Libya was also the family of Saleh Sariyeh, a Palestinian originally from the Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp in Lebanon who had lived in Derna for decades. The 62-year-old, his wife and two daughters were all killed when their home in Derna was washed away, his nephew Mohammed Sariyeh told the AP.\n \n The four were buried in Derna. Because of ongoing gunbattles in Ein el-Hilweh, the family there could not hold a gathering to receive condolences from friends and neighbours, Mohammed said.\n \n Derna, about 900 kilometres (560 miles) east of the capital, Tripoli, is controlled by the forces of powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter, who is allied with the eastern Libyan government. The rival government in western Libya, based in Tripoli, is allied with other armed groups.\n \n Derna was once a hub for extremist groups in the years of chaos that followed the NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.\n \n -------\n \n \nMagdy reported from Cairo.

In recent months, North Korea has repeatedly failed to put its first military spy satellite into orbit.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPutin met Kim's limousine, brought from Pyongyang in the North Korean leader's \nspecial armoured train\n, at the entrance to the launch facility, greeting his guest with a handshake that lasted about 40 seconds. In opening remarks, Putin talked about the Soviet Union's wartime support for North Korea and said the talks would cover economic cooperation, humanitarian issues and the \"situation in the region.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKim, in turn, pledged continued support for Moscow, making an apparent reference to the war in Ukraine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Russia is currently engaged in a just fight against hegemonic forces to defend its sovereign rights, security and interests,\" he said. \"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always expressed its full and unconditional support for all measures taken by the Russian government and I take this opportunity to reaffirm that we will always stand with Russia on the anti-imperialist front and the front of independence,\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNorth Korea may have tens of millions of aging artillery shells and rockets based on Soviet designs that could give a huge boost to the Russian army in Ukraine, analysts say.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe United States has accused North Korea of providing Russia with arms, including selling artillery shells to the Russian mercenary group Wagner. Both Russian and North Korean officials have denied such claims.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut either buying arms from or providing rocket technology to North Korea would violate international sanctions that Russia has supported in the past.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnd it would both underscore and deepen Russia's isolation in the more than 18 months after its invasion of Ukraine drew increasing sanctions that have cut off Moscow's economy from global markets and shrunk the circle of world leaders willing to meet with Putin. Wednesday's summit came three weeks after a suspicious plane crash killed Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who in June launched a brief rebellion that challenged Putin. The Kremlin denied it was behind the crash.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs the leaders toured a Soyuz-2 space rocket launch facility, Kim peppered a Russian space official with questions about the rockets.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKim and Putin met together with their delegations and later one-on-one, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. After the talks, the Russian president gave an official lunch for Kim, Russian state media reported.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPutin told Russian state TV that Kim will visit two more cities in the Far East on his own after the summit, flying to Komsomolsk-on-Amur, where he will visit an aircraft plant, and then go to Vladivostok to attend \"a demonstration of capabilities\" of Russia's Pacific Fleet, visit a university and other facilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRussia and North Korea have \"lots of interesting projects\" in spheres like transportation and agriculture, he said. Moscow is providing its neighbour with humanitarian aid, but there also are opportunities for \"working as equals,\" so \"the prospects are not bad,\" Putin added.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe dodged the issue, however, of their military cooperation, saying only that Russia is abiding by the sanctions prohibiting procurement of weapons from Pyongyang. \"There are certain restrictions, Russia is following all of them. There are things we can talk about, we're discussing, thinking. Russia is a self-sufficient country, but there are things we can bring attention to, we're discussing them,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nSign up for breaking news alerts from CTV News, right at your fingertips\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe meeting came hours after \nNorth Korea fired two ballistic missiles toward the sea\n, extending a highly provocative run in North Korean weapons testing since the start of 2022, as Kim used the distraction caused by Putin's war on Ukraine to accelerate his weapons development.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff didn't immediately say how far the North Korean missiles flew. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said they landed in waters outside the country's exclusive economic zones and there were no reports of damage to vessels or aircraft.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOfficial photos showed that Kim was accompanied by Pak Thae Song, chairman of North Korea's space science and technology committee, and navy Adm. Kim Myong Sik, who are linked with North Korean efforts to acquire spy satellites and nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarines, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAsked whether Russia will help North Korea build satellites, Putin was quoted by Russian state media as saying \"that's why we have come here. The DPRK leader shows keen interest in rocket technology. They're trying to develop space, too,\" using the abbreviation for North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Asked about military cooperation, Putin said \"we will talk about all issues without a rush. There is time.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKim also brought Jo Chun Ryong, a ruling party official in charge of munitions policies, who joined him on recent tours of factories producing artillery shells and missiles, according to South Korea.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDespite the recent frequency of North Korean missile firings, Wednesday's launches on the eve of the summit came as a surprise. South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said it was the first time the North launched a missile while Kim was travelling overseas.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tKim could have ordered the launches to make a point to Putin about North Korea's defence posture and show that he remains in close control of the country's military activities even while abroad, said Moon Seong Mook, an analyst with the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMoon, a retired South Korean brigadier general who participated in past inter-Korean military talks, said the North with the launches could have also intended to express its anger toward the United States, after State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a press briefing that Putin was meeting \"an international pariah to ask for assistance in a war.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpeculation about military cooperation grew after Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North Korea in July. Kim subsequently toured his weapons factories, which experts said had the dual goal of encouraging the modernization of North Korean weaponry and examining artillery and other supplies that could be exported to Russia.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDuring their lunch, which reportedly featured regional delicacies such as Kamchatka crab dumplings and taiga lingonberries with pine nuts and condensed milk, Kim said he and Putin agreed to deepen their \"strategic and tactical cooperation,\" and that he believes Russia will achieve victory, apparently referring to the war in Ukraine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We believe with certainty that the Russian army and people will achieve a great victory in the just fight to punish the evil forces pursuing hegemonic and expansionary ambitions and create a stable environment for national development,\" Kim said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t------\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nLitvinova reported from Tallinn, Estonia.

Witnesses were slated to discuss the tactics used by Beijing to interfere in other countries, including “transnational repression and its effects on diaspora and dissident communities in the United States, Canada and worldwide,” according to Tuesday’s meeting notice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tChong — who is also the Conservative foreign affairs critic — told the commission his experience is but one example of Beijing’s interference in Canada, while “many, many other cases go unreported and unnoticed, and the victims suffer in silence.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDuring his testimony, he also repeated his desire to see the Canadian government implement a foreign agent registry — similar to those in Australia and the United States — which the Liberal government has said it will explore.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I think one way in which we could better co-operate is (by) exchang(ing) information on legislative best models to see what works and what doesn't,” Chong said. “We have similar judicial systems in our democracies, so that's one area of cooperation.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMinister of Public Safety, Democratic Institutions and Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc told CTV’s Power Play host Vassy Kapelos last week that his government “hopes to proceed quickly” on legislation to create a foreign agent registry as part of a series of measures to combat foreign interference.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Liberal government has been discussing the possibility of such a registry since last December.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWitnesses before the commission Tuesday, including Chong, are also offering recommendations for “further congressional and administrative action and transatlantic cooperation,” according to the commission.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tChong previously told CTV News members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are interested in hearing about his experience, \"but also that of Hong Kong democracy activists and human rights activists who have been targeted here on Canadian soil by Beijing.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe also said American officials are interested in understanding the foreign interference situation in Canada as well as discussing solutions to counter it.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tChong told the commission Tuesday some of the ways China allegedly interferes in Canada, including by targeting diaspora groups and international students, launching disinformation campaigns on Chinese-language social media sites, running Chinese police stations abroad, and wrongfully detaining Canadians, for example, the two Michaels, Spavor and Kovrig.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tChong also detailed his recent experience being the target of a disinformation campaign, after a Canadian monitoring system detected a likely \nChina-backed \"information operation\"\n targeting him in May.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast week, after several months of calls — prompted in part by the reporting about Chong being a target of Beijing — the Liberal government \nlaunched a public inquiry\n into foreign interference in Canadian democracy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Democracies are often slow to react to the treat of authoritarian states, which can act much more quickly, because it’s one person or a few people (who) rule,” Chong said, in response to a question about whether the Canadian government has been supportive of him amid reports he’s been a target of Beijing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tChong is not the only Canadian MP or past federal election candidate to allege they've been targeted by China. And this summer, a former RCMP officer was charged with foreign interference-related offences, after being accused of helping the Chinese government's efforts to \"identify and intimidate an individual outside the scope of Canadian law.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I think it's important to note that my case is one of many cases across Canada of many Canadians who suffer in silence,\" Chong previously told CTV News. \"My case happens to be a very high profile case, but there are many, many Canadians who have been targeted by Beijing here on Canadian soil.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nWith files from CTV News’ Senior Digital Parliamentary Reporter Rachel Aiello \n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Andrzej Kubisiak with the state-funded Polish Economic Institute said the greatest demand for workers in Poland and other countries in the region is in manufacturing, construction and logistics. Those are jobs traditionally done by men, while most of the Ukrainian refugees are women.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We need men but get refugee women who are not economic migrants, they are refugees. This is a different type of migration,\" said Kubisiak, who was not a participant in the research. \"They look for a place to live, not to work.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe study sought to understand why the number of Ukrainian refugees has been decreasing in Poland, a first stop for many after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and why the number has been growing in Germany. For the first months of the war, Poland hosted more Ukrainian refugees than any other country.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat has changed. According to European Union statistics, there were 1.1 million Ukrainian citizens registered in Germany at the end of June, compared to 975,000 in Poland. That amounts to a decrease of more than 350,000 in Poland since August 2022, while the number has grown more than 410,000 in Germany.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOf the 350,000 who left Poland, 150,000 went to Germany, according to the report, titled \"From Poland to Germany. New Trends in Ukrainian Refugee Migration.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe study found that a developing network of Ukrainians in Germany is a factor in the migration shift, as people already established there help friends and acquaintances make the step. The Ukrainians questioned in the study also gave other reasons for choosing Germany, including higher wages, higher social benefits for refugees and better medical services.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe study also pointed to compulsory German language classes organized by the government for refugees as an important factor that has helped Ukrainians become integrated into society and find their way in the workforce. The Polish government, by contrast, offers free language training to refugees but it is not compulsory. The result is that Ukrainians are integrating better into German than Polish society, the report concluded.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe study interviewed 400 Ukrainian refugees who had first fled to Poland and then moved to Germany.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJan Malicki, director of the Centre for East European studies, said 400 was a large enough group to draw conclusions.

Yet excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices rose 4.3%, a step back from 4.7% in July and the smallest increase in nearly two years. That is still far from the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe latest on inflation in Canada\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop business headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDespite the seemingly divergent figures, the decline in the core measure points to inflation coming under control. The Federal Reserve closely tracks core prices because they are seen as a better indicator of future inflation trends.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWednesday's figures also make it more likely the Fed will skip an interest rate hike at its meeting next week. While higher gas prices could lift inflation this month as well, most economists believe that inflation will slowly decline through the end of the year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn a monthly basis, consumer prices jumped 0.6% in August, the biggest increase in more than a year. Gas prices spiked nearly 11%, though they have since levelled off: According to AAA, the average nationwide price at the pump was $3.85 on Wednesday, unchanged from a month ago.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe big rise in gas prices accounted for more than half of the monthly inflation increase, the government said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tExcluding food and energy, core prices increased just 0.3% in August from July, though that is up from 0.2% in the two previous months.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEnergy costs rose 5.6% just in August, the biggest monthly increase since June 2022. Auto insurance prices also soared, rising 2.4% last month and 19.1% compared with a year ago. The sharp increase in new car prices in the past two years has also made them more expensive to insure and repair.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut prices rose more slowly, or even fell last month for many other items: Used car costs dropped 1.2%, the third straight decrease, while hotel prices fell 3%, also the third consecutive fall.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGrocery prices moved up 0.2%, a trend that has strained many household's finances. But food cost increases are cooling: They rose 3% compared with a year ago, down from double-digit increases last year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFederal Reserve officials are becoming more open to the idea that inflation is coming under control, though chair Jerome Powell said last month it was still \"too high.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut in his high-profile speech at Jackson Hole, Powell said that the Fed would proceed \"carefully\" with any further rate hikes, which many economists saw as an opening for the Fed to skip a rate increase at its September 19-20 meeting. When the Fed increases its key rate, it typically raises the cost of mortgages, auto loans, and business borrowing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Fed has lifted its benchmark interest rate 11 times in the past 12 meetings to about 5.4%, the highest level in 22 years. It increased the rate a quarter-point in July after leaving it unchanged in June.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve's Dallas branch, said last week that \"another skip could be appropriate\" at its next meeting, \"but skipping does not imply stopping.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInvestors see only a 3% chance of a rate hike next week, according to CME's FedWatch. But they have priced in a 40% chance for an increase at the Fed's subsequent meeting in November.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe European Central Bank is also contemplating lifting its key interest rate at its next meeting Thursday, though officials could choose to also skip an increase. The European economy is nearing recession as it struggles with high inflation and rising borrowing costs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe 20 countries that use the euro currency are expected to grow just 0.8% this year, according to a gloomy forecast issued Monday by the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm. Germany's economy, the EU's largest, is projected to shrink 0.4%. Inflation in the EU is higher than in the U.S. -- it was 5.3% in July -- though that is half of the 10.6% peak reached in October.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

My heart went out to them. And I was really happy to be part of it and make it happen.”\n \n Brown put a tracker on the boat so the newlyweds could see when the rest of the family would be arriving.\n \n Due to strong winds, the ride was about 50 minutes.\n \n The wedding was delayed by 90 minutes to ensure the father-of-the-bride could attend.\n \n The couple said it was especially important to have the 92-year-old there because the bride’s mother passed away just two months before.\n \n “It did mean the world, especially with mom being gone; she was supposed to be there,” Lalonde said.\n \n ‘BEAUTIFUL DAY’\n \n The rest of the day went off without a hitch.\n \n Lalonde walked his daughter down the aisle in blue suede shoes, the same pair he wore when he got married in 1955.\n \n \nLalonde walked his daughter down the aisle in blue suede shoes, the same pair he wore when he got married in 1955.\n \n “One of the highlights,” he described of that moment. “Being there and seeing two happy people, united and starting a new life, it’s an experience. It was great.”\n \n A few people were not able to attend due to the rockslide and they organized a viewing party to see the nuptials.\n \n “It was a beautiful, beautiful day; beautiful ceremony,” Lalonde said.

It celebrated all different body shapes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\n5 Things to Know newsletter: Sign up to start your day with the biggest stories\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nFollow CTV News on TikTok for the stories that matter to you\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTop models like Winnie Harlow, who has vitiligo, a skin condition, showed up wearing some of the designs. The event also showcased the creators' looks on headless mannequins of all body types.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Victoria's Secret World Tour, to be aired globally on Amazon Prime Video on Sept. 26, marks the company's biggest marketing investment in the past five years and its latest bid to reverse its supercharged sexy image that left it irrelevant to many women, leading to several years of sales declines.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThose efforts include revamping its marketing to highlight fuller-figure women in ads and store mannequins, and expanding into mastectomy bras and comfy sports bras. It's also refreshening its stores with brighter lights and blush pink walls. And it replaced its supermodel \"Angels\" with a group of 10 diverse women who have advised the brand and promoted it on social media.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"My motive to be here is that I have girls,\" said Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima, a long-time Victoria's Secret Angel, on the red carpet. \"Some of my girls want to be models so I feel that in this day, Victoria's Secret and other brands are embracing and celebrating women in their different stages. So that's a beautiful thing.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCampbell told The Associated Press that there are many girls who want to work and create for Victoria's Secret, \"and now they will have the chance to.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut Victoria's Secret faces an uphill battle, some experts say.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile the brand is still the largest lingerie label by sales in the U.S., its market share has eroded to 18.7% last year from 31.2% in 2017, hurt by smaller rivals like American Eagle's Aerie and other online startups that were inclusive from the get-go and offered more comfort, according to market researcher Euromonitor International.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast year, the Reynoldsburg, Ohio-based company bought online rival Adore me for $400 million in cash but Victoria's Secret still delivered another quarter of sales drops for the period ended July 29. And it forecasts sales will continue to fall for the rest of the year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tVictoria's Secret CEO Martin Waters told analysts last week that turning around the business will take some time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We recognize that neither our brand revolution nor our strategy will return the full potential overnight,\" Waters said. \"We're on a journey. We also believe that there is a clear path to growth through the current turbulent environment and into the future.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt wasn't so long ago Victoria's Secret had a long unparalleled run of success.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe brand was founded by the late Roy Larson Raymond in the late 1970s after he felt embarrassed about purchasing lingerie for his wife. Lex Wexner, the founder of the Limited Stores Inc. that was rebranded as L Brands in 2013, purchased Victoria's Secret in 1982 and turned it into a powerful retail force. By the mid-1990s, Victoria's Secret lit up runways and the internet with its supermodels.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut Victoria's Secret's sales started to tumble in 2017 when the #MeToo movement began, emboldening women to look for brands that focused on positive reinforcement of their bodies. In 2019, Victoria's Secret's long time marketing chief Edward Razek resigned. That same year, the company said it would rethink its fashion show.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWexner -- who apologized in 2019 for his ties with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, indicted on sex-trafficking charges -- stepped down in 2020 as CEO and chairman of L Brands and then severed his final ties by exiting the board a year later. In 2021, Victoria's Secret split off from L Brands as its own separate public company.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"They had a very clear story,\" said Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce. \"Unfortunately, the story became toxic.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast year, singer Jax came out with a song titled \"Victoria's Secret,\" in which she criticized the brand in her lyrics: \"I know Victoria's secret and, girl, you wouldn't believe. She's an old man who lives in Ohio making money off of girls like me.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAdamson said Victoria's Secret is now pushing the same message as everyone else about diverse body types and comfort. But it isn't standing out.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSierra Mariela, a 20-year-old sophomore at University of Pennsylvania, hasn't stepped into a Victoria's Secret store in at least five years because she was turned off by the messaging. Instead, she has been going to Target or Depop, a privately held marketplace for used clothing, for her lingerie needs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I grew up as someone who's not stereotypically thin, and I just felt like the environment created was for a very specific type of person,\" she said. \"I just felt more connected with other brands.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWaters noted on last week's investor call that Wednesday's fashion event would offer the brand an opportunity \"to reclaim its position at the center of cultural relevance, whether that's fashion, art, music or popular culture.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt reflects the company's mission: \"to uplift and champion women -- on a global scale.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe event, headlined by a performance by Doja Cat, showed snippets of the Victoria's Secret film that includes runway shows of both the creators' looks and a couture collection designed by the company's design team. Victoria's Secret is offering 13 designs inspired by the couture items -- silky robes, lacey pants and bustier bras -- for sale in late September.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe film features many of the original show's famous models like Campbell, Lima and Gigi Hadad, but also includes many fuller-size models like Paloma Elsesser that the brand has been working with for a few years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMelissa Valdes Duque, a 24-year-old designer from Bogota, Colombia, who appears in the film, created crocheted looks that symbolize women's physical and emotional scars. She acknowledged the brand had upheld certain unrealistic standards.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There were certain standards about bodies and beauty that we all follow,\" she said. \"But brands and people ... we all grow up.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t-------\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nAP Entertainment TV producer John Carucci in New York contributed to this report.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Government officials say extending that further would be extremely difficult due to the age of the technology.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nCapital Dispatch: Sign up for in-depth political coverage of Parliament Hill\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe new fleet of planes, which will be named the CC-330 Husky, includes four new and five used aircraft that are being outfitted to feature the same capabilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe government bought the used planes from a company in Kuwait, and two of them are set to begin flying out of Ottawa International Airport this fall.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of those will be painted in a way that is similar to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's current plane, and it is expected to be delivered this summer. Officials would not say whether it will be ready for use in September, when Trudeau is expected to attend the G20 summit in India.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe aging Polaris fleet has caused issues for Trudeau throughout his time in office.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA problem in October 2016 required the aircraft to return to Ottawa 30 minutes after taking off with Trudeau, who was en route to Belgium to sign the Canada-Europe free-trade deal.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn October 2019, the VIP plane rolled into a wall while being towed into a hangar at 8 Wing Trenton, sustaining \"significant structural damage to the nose and right engine cowling,\" according to the Air Force.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe plane was out of service for several months that year. A backup aircraft was used to take Trudeau to the NATO summit in December 2019, but it was grounded in London when the Air Force discovered a problem with one of the engines.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCanadian crews have been training to fly the new aircraft in the United Kingdom since January. On average, it takes about three months of training for a Polaris pilot to be ready to fly the new Airbus, National Defence officials said in a background briefing for reporters on Tuesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTwo of the used planes were purchased for US$102 million last June and the remaining three were bought this month at a cost of US$150 million.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Airbus contract includes advanced training devices and a full flight simulator, which will eliminate the need to send crews to Germany to train twice a year, officials said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Husky planes will be able to perform air-to-air refuelling for Canada's NATO allies, including F-35 fighter jets and the U.S. Air Force's fighter jets. Canada has committed to buying 88 F-35 planes, which are set to be delivered starting in 2026.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDefence Department officials said the fleet will be housed at three bases: one in the east, one in the west and one in the north, but they have not yet determined exactly where those will be.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNew infrastructure is part of the contract as well, because the planes are about 50 per cent heavier and 50 per cent wider than those in the current fleet.

Musk pushed back last week, writing on X that Starlink was never activated over Crimea and that he had actually received “an emergency request from government authorities” to enable the service, with the “obvious intent being to sink most of the Russian fleet at anchor.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"If I had agreed to their request, then SpaceX would be explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation,\" Musk wrote.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPerhaps more importantly, Isaacson subsequently walked back the bombshell claim, which had received significant media coverage and was published as an “untold story” book excerpt in The Washington Post.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"To clarify on the Starlink issue: the Ukrainians THOUGHT coverage was enabled all the way to Crimea, but it was not,\" Isaacson posted on X, effectively reiterating what Musk had said. \"They asked Musk to enable it for their drone sub attack on the Russian fleet.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Based on my conversations with Musk, I mistakenly thought the policy to not allow Starlink to be used for an attack on Crimea had been first decided on the night of the Ukrainian attempted sneak attack that night,\" Isaacson added in a follow up post. “He now says that the policy had been implemented earlier, but the Ukrainians did not know it, and that night he simply reaffirmed the policy.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe correction has cast a pall over the biography from Isaacson, a highly respected author who has written acclaimed biographies on historic visionaries, including Steve Jobs, Benjamin Franklin, and Albert Einstein. Isaacson, a professor of history at Tulane University and former head of CNN, has for years enjoyed such a sterling reputation in the media industry that newsrooms have often taken his reporting to be fact.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNow, Isaacson is having to grapple with an embarrassing problem. A spokesperson for his publisher Simon & Schuster told me on Monday that “future editions of the book will be updated” to no longer include the error.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNewsrooms, meanwhile, are updating their stories in the wake of the mischaracterization. Over the weekend, The Post updated the excerpt it had published and offered a correction to its readers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"After publication of this adaptation, the author learned that his book mischaracterized the attempted attack by Ukrainian drones on the Russian fleet in Crimea,\" the correction stated. “Musk had already disabled (‘geofenced’) coverage within 100 km of the Crimean coast before the attack began, and when the Ukrainians discovered this, they asked him to activate the coverage, and he refused. This version reflects that change.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCNN also updated its story on Monday, noting Isaacson had backpedalled his initial claims.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"After this story published, Walter Isaacson clarified his explanation regarding Elon Musk restricting Ukrainian military access to Starlink, a critical satellite internet service,” an editor’s note said. “This story has been updated to reflect that change.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

And that is how we will proceed,\" Freeland told reporters on Wednesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe said her government would change current tax legislation to make the subsidies tax-free.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe PBO report published Wednesday provided a fiscal and economic analysis of the construction phase of the facility only, leaving out the operation phase.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tYves Giroux, the parliamentary budget officer, said his office is unable to take on analysis of the costs and benefits arising from the operation of the plant until it receives clearance from the federal government and Volkswagen.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe said the deal includes confidential information regarding minimum production levels that cannot be disclosed directly or indirectly.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's very hard to assess without doing further analysis and without being relieved of the confidentiality provisions that cover the production schedule,\" Giroux said in a media briefing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe analysis of the construction phaseestimated that the deal would create a peak of 3,100 jobs at the start of 2026, but that figure would fall to 1,400 by the end of 2027.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe federal government announced in April the details of the deal -- which would see Volkswagen build its first gigafactory outside of Europe --and promised it would create up to 3,000 direct jobs and 30,000 indirect jobs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 14, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Luckily, a new cookbook lets Catan fans savour the board game even more while out-trading opponents.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Catan: The Official Cookbook \" includes 77 recipes inspired by the multiplayer phenomenon, dishes like Forest Dweller's Dip, Tavern Ale Pie and Fireside Banana Boats. There are snacks, small plates, full dinners, desserts and even a few drinks.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nFollow CTV News on TikTok for the stories that matter to you\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We wanted them to be fun, but real. This is a real cookbook. There are recipes in here that you can and should definitely make. It's not just a gimmick or a gag gift by any means,\" says Casie Vogel, vice president of editorial at Ulysses Press.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe recipes pay homage to the game, in which competitors try to build settlements on a fictional island using five resources: wool, grain, lumber, brick and ore.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe cookbook includes dishes with lamb, to honor the wool, while there are a few that call for bricks: Brick Smash Burger, Chicken Under a Brick and Homemade Fudge Bricks. Cast-iron skillets are used in a nod to the game's use of ore. There's even a seven-layer dip for gamers who know that rolling a seven can mess with your plans.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The game is designed to be family-friendly. I know a lot of people play with family, they play with friends. They teach new people to play. And there are people who are extreme Catan gamers,\" says Vogel. \"We wanted to have recipes that reflected the different levels of dedication.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLike the game, the cookbook is welcoming of all ages and all skill levels, and includes recipes that are gluten-free, vegetarian and vegan. You can whip up a batch of Manchego cheese crackers for friends as you play, or cater a bigger dinner party with the Great Hall Rack of Lamb.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We have some big dinner feasts-level dishes that I think can also kind of transport you to the Island of Catan,\" Vogel says. \"You kind of have that feeling of adventuring, maybe something that you would have if you were an explorer, like at a tavern. That's kind of the vibe we were trying to go with some of those bigger dishes.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe board game, originally called The Settlers of Catan when introduced in 1995, has sold tens of millions of copies and is available in more than 40 languages. It has spawned dozens of spinoffs and new editions, including electronic versions. It was named by The Wall Street Journal as \"the board game of our time.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInterest in Catan surged during the pandemic, with sales skyrocketing as people played the game in quarantine. Vogel, a board game fan, had been playing Catan for a long time and was admittedly \"obsessed\" even before 2020.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"But in the pandemic, it was intense. So I know the ins and outs of the game and it was so exciting to talk to other people who are just as passionate about it, and then really make something fun and referential.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tVogel -- along with a recipe creator and a tester -- came up with the dishes with the blessing of the game maker, and she calls the process \"collaborative.\" She started work in fall 2021.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"What brings people together? Board games and food... People can share, and it can be a community-building thing. So it just makes all the sense in the world,\" said Kelli Schmitz, the brand development director at Catan Studio, which grows the brand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile cookbooks have been made of games before -- Tomb Raider, The Elder Scrolls, Minecraft and Street Fighter, among them -- they're based on video games. Vogel thinks her cookbook might be the first inspired and authenticated by a board game.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of her favourites is Over-Knight Oats -- loaded with bananas, nuts and sweet spices -- and she has celebrated victories with Port Wine Spritz, which uses fresh fruit, full-bodied, sweet port and club soda.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe cookbook, which comes out the same month as the Catan U.S. national championships in Minnesota, reflects an aspect of the game that players enjoy -- it prizes cooperation over annihilation. Creator Klaus Teuber had grown up in post-WWII Germany and wasn't interested in war.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There is a broader sense of community. You have to be a good negotiator. You have to be willing to work with other people. You can't just be an island unto yourself,\" said Schmitz. \"It's really about fostering community and I think we've done a good job at that.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Riders can turn on the option in the Lyft app, however, the company warns that it’s not a guarantee that they’ll be matched with a woman or non-binary person if one of those people aren’t nearby. Both the riders and drivers will need to opt-in to the feature for it to work and riders must choose a gender for it to work.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough women encompass “nearly half” of its riders, Lyft said that just 23 per cent of its drivers are women, the company said. The feature was also built with assistance from outside organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign and the U.S. National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLyft and its rival Uber have been under scrutiny for years about riders’ safety, especially with sexual assault incidents. Lyft said in 2021 that it received 4,158 reports of sexual assault between 2017 and 2019, a disclosure that was revealed in a safety report prompted by a CNN investigation. However, Lyft said the vast majority of trips (or 99 per cent) had no reported safety incidents for the time period included in its report.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLast year, Lyft agreed to a US$25 million settlement with shareholders pertaining to statements and disclosures about its business, including specifically around assault-related incidents, ahead of going public in 2019.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn March 2021, Uber and Lyft announced they would share the names of drivers who were deactivated over the most severe safety incidents including sexual assaults, which range from non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual body part to rape.

Have they become too extreme?", "summary": "", "content": "\n     \n     \nNEW YORK - \n\n     \n    \n\r\n\tA tortilla chip maker's decision to pull its extremely spicy product sold as a \"One Chip Challenge\" from store shelves following the death of a Massachusetts teen has renewed attention on the popularity -- and risks -- of similar dares marketed by brands and spread widely online.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpicy food challenges have been around for years. From local chile pepper eating contests to restaurant walls of fame for those who finished extra hot dishes, people around the world have been daring each other to eat especially fiery foods, with some experts pointing to the internal rush of competition and risk-taking.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut extremely spicy products created and marketed solely for the challenges -- and possible internet fame -- is a more recent phenomenon, and teens are particularly exposed to them because of social media, associate professor of psychology at Florida International University Elisa Trucco says.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThere's a \"glamorization of these challenges on social media,\" Trucco said. \"You see a lot of `likes' or comments (indicating) social status or popularity from these challenges, but you don't see a lot of the negative consequences -- like the trips to the E.R. or other injuries.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlexander DePaoli, an associate teaching professor of marketing at Northeastern University, added that people may put themselves through discomfort and share it online for a sense of \"in-group belonging,\" similar to offline challenges as a game of truth or dare.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA YouTube series called \"Hot Ones,\" for example, rose to internet fame several years ago with videos of celebrities' reactions to eating spicy wings. Meanwhile, restaurants nationwide continue to offer in-person challenges -- from Buffalo Wild Wings' \"Blazin' Challenge\" to the \"Hell Challenge\" of Wing King in Las Vegas. In both challenges, patrons over 18 can attempt to eat a certain amount of wings doused in extra hot sauce in limited time without drinking or eating other food.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tChile pepper eating contests are also regularly hosted around the world. Last year, Gregory Foster ate 10 Carolina Reaper chillies, which Guinness World Records has named the hottest in the world, at a record time of 33.15 seconds in San Diego, California.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn most cases, people will choose to participate in challenges that they are trained for or don't consider to be truly dangerous. But a line is crossed when someone gets hurt, DePaoli noted.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile the autopsy results for 10th-grader Harris Wolobah are still pending, the teen's family alleges that the One Chip Challenge is responsible for his Sept. 1 death. The product, manufactured by Paqui, instructs participants to eat an eponymously named chip and then see how long they can go without consuming other food and water.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSales of the chip seem largely driven by people posting videos on social media of them or their friends taking the challenge. They show people, including teens and children, eating the chips and then reacting to the heat. Some videos show people gagging, coughing and begging for water.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSince Wolobah's death, Paqui has asked retailers to stop selling the product and some health experts have pointed to potential dangers of eating such spicy products under certain circumstances, particularly depending on the amount of capsaicin, a component that gives chile peppers their heat.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut there are plenty of similar products that remain online and on store shelves, including Red Hot Reaper's One Chip Challenge, Blazing Foods' Death Nut Challenge and Tube of Terror Challenge as well as Wilder Toys' Hot Ones Truth or Dab sauce game. The Associated Press reached out to each company after Paqui pulled its own product, but did not receive a response.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDePaoli said it's not unusual for companies to engage in viral marketing.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It is unusual, however, to have something where the brand actually wants you to put something into your body,\" he said.

It’s created by AI", "summary": "", "content": "\n     \n     \nNEW YORK - \n\n     \n    \n\r\n\tFor about a year and a half, Coca-Cola has experimented with limited-edition beverages that have mystery tastes — most of them with vague, futuristic concepts and undisclosed flavours.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe latest one, Coca-Cola Y3000, fits the bill. The one distinction: It's supposed to taste like the future. Fittingly, the soft-drink giant used artificial intelligence to help determine the flavour and packaging.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt's important for Coca-Cola to keep customers — particularly younger ones — excited about Coke, its more-than-a-century-old signature product. In recent years, health-conscious consumers have shied away from sugary beverages, making it trickier for soda sellers to market their legacy brands. Coca-Cola has used its Creations platform, responsible for limited-edition flavours like Y3000, to try to make the brand resonate with younger consumers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop business headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLike all Creations drinks, Coca-Cola Y3000 is designed to taste mostly like Coke, with a bit of something else. To come up with that extra note of flavour, and the packaging design, Coca-Cola turned to AI.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe company relied on regular old human insights by finding out what flavours people associate with the future. Then it used AI to help figure out flavour pairings and profiles, a spokesperson said. For the product's packaging — which appears to allude to a Y2K aesthetic with funky bubbles, pink and blue colouring and a pixelated logo — Coca-Cola used AI-generated images to create a mood board for inspiration. The aluminum can even gives credit where it's due, prominently noting it's \"Co-Created with AI.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tY3000, which comes in zero and full sugar varieties in the United States and Canada, will be sold for a limited time starting Tuesday and cost as much as regular Coke.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs with other flavours from Coca-Cola's Creations platform, Y3000 pairs online experiences with real-life events or merchandise. Customers can scan a QR code on the Y3000 package to reach the Creations site, where they can play around with what the future might look like in 977 years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe launch also includes a limited-edition capsule collection developed with the luxury streetwear brand Ambush, available at the brand's website this fall. Coca-Cola has also partnered with the fashion brand Highsnobiety on a collection in the past.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSPACE, DREAMS AND PIXELS\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCoca-Cola has released a number of limited edition flavours through Creations, most recently Coca-Cola Ultimate, which was aimed at gamers and made in partnership with Riot Games, publisher of the multi-player online battle arena game League of Legends.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBefore Ultimate came Starlight, inspired by space; Dreamworld, which the company said tastes like dreams; and Byte, which is supposed to have a pixel flavour. Coca-Cola has also partnered with musicians Rosalía and Marshmello on limited-edition flavours.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWith the exception of the Marshmello beverage (flavoured not with marshmallows, but strawberry and watermelon) Coca-Cola has stayed mum on what these products are supposed to taste like.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We're never really going to answer that question\" in a \"straightforward\" way, Oana Vlad, senior director of global strategy at Coca-Cola, previously told CNN. But \"the flavour profile is always, we say, 85 to 90 per cent Coke. And then that 10-to-15 per cent twist of something unexpected.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe flavours are not designed to become permanent offerings, said CEO James Quincey at the Redburn CEO conference last year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"They're more engaging and more interesting, demonstrably, than a flavour, a Coke with vanilla or something,\" he said. \"Testing the boundaries … that's about engagement with consumers.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

South Korean media cited anonymous government sources to report Monday that a train presumably carrying Kim had departed from North Korea's capital, Pyongyang.\n \n Putin and Kim could meet in eastern Russia's city of Vladivostok, where Kim took his green-and-yellow armoured train to their previous summit. Russian state news agency Tass said Putin arrived in the city Monday to attend an international forum that continues through Wednesday.\n \n Associated Press journalists near the North Korea-Russia frontier saw a green train with yellow trim at a station on the North Korean side of a border river.\n \n U.S. officials have said a meeting with Kim would give Putin a chance to advance discussions on North Korean arm sales to refill Russian reserves drained by the war in Ukraine. North Korea could seek badly needed economic aid and advanced weapons technologies that could potentially increase the threat of a growing nuclear weapons and missiles arsenal that is designed to target the United States, South Korea, and Japan.\n \n Whether Kim would again travel by rail for his first foreign trip since the start of the coronavirus pandemic has been a focus of media attention. His reportedly luxurious train stands in sharp contrast to the grinding poverty of daily life for most North Koreans.\n \n Kim's famously flight-averse father, Kim Jong Il, made about a dozen trips abroad during his 17-year rule, almost all to China and all by train. North Korea's state media said that the elder Kim died of a heart attack during a train trip in 2011.\n \n According to an account published in 2002 by Konstantin Pulikovsky, a Russian official who accompanied Kim Jong ll on a three-week trip to Moscow, the train carried cases of expensive French wine and passengers could feast on fresh lobster and pork barbeque.\n \n The train's most important feature, however, was security.\n \n \nA green train with yellow trimmings, resembling one used by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on his previous travels, is seen on Monday, Sept. 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n \n According to South Korean media reports, Kim Jong Il had several luxurious trains equipped with reception halls, conference rooms and high-tech communication facilities. To guard against possible attacks, his train reportedly travelled with two other trains, with one running in advance of his vehicle to check the safety of the rail line while another carried security agents and followed behind. High-tech communication equipment and flat-screen TVs were installed so that the leader could give orders and receive briefings.\n \n In a sign of the trains' symbolic importance, a life-size mock-up of one of the carriages is on permanent display at a mausoleum on the outskirts of Pyongyang where the embalmed bodies of Kim Jong Il and his state-founding father, Kim Il Sung, lie in state.\n \n South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said it couldn't immediately find records that Kim Jong Un used advance trains like his father did when he made his previous foreign trips by rail before the pandemic.\n \n Kim, who is 39, has used his family's armoured train for previous meetings with Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 and 2019.\n \n But he does sometimes fly, unlike his father. Schooled for several years in Switzerland, Kim is believed to have travelled by air often as a teenager.\n \n \nIn this photo provided by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, second left, talks with Chinese Communist Party's International Department head Song Tao, second right, in a train on the way home from China, on Jan. 9, 2019.

North Korea calls it \"Chammae-1,\" named after the goshawk, North Korea's national bird. South Korean media say the plane can carry about 200 people and its maximum range is about 9,200 kilometres (5,700 miles) but it has reportedly never flown that far.\n \n Putin, for his part, now prefers to avoid airplanes and also travels on a special armoured train since his decision to invade Ukraine in early 2022, according to Gleb Karakulov, a defector from Putin's secretive elite security service.\n \n \nThe train used by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is seen leaving Beijing Railway Station in Beijing on Jan. 9, 2019.  (Photo by STR / AFP) (Photo credit should read STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n \n Kim's earlier meeting with Putin required a daylong trip that began at the North Korean capital of Pyongyang and chugged over the country's aging railways along the eastern coast before crossing a river that serves as the border with Russia. Associated Press journalists near the North Korea-Russia frontier saw a green train with yellow trim at a station on the North Korean side of the border river Monday evening. It was unclear whether Kim was on the train, which had not crossed the bridge as of 7 p.m. (1000 GMT) Monday.\n \n  \n \nIf you're on Telegram, subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on top stories\n \n \n In all, Kim went to China four times from 2018 to 2019 to meet Xi -- two of them by train and two on his jet. In June 2018, he borrowed a Chinese plane to meet Trump in Singapore, reportedly because his jet was deemed unsafe. For another meeting with Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, Kim took his train on the two-and-half day trip.\n \n Since closing his country's borders in early 2020 to guard against the COVID-19 pandemic, Kim hasn't met any foreign leader.\n \n Kim's possible second trip to Russia could signal a restart of a summit-driven diplomacy and may be followed by a trip to China for a meeting with Xi, said Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in South Korea.\n \n \nA green train with yellow trimmings, resembling one used by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on his previous travels, is seen on Monday, Sept. 11, 2023.

However, consumer behaviour has changed since the pandemic, and the chain has experienced a surge in business through its drive-thru and delivery services, with fewer people choosing to eat in its dining rooms, reducing the need for the machines.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop business headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMcDonald's future includes restaurant designs with smaller or no dining rooms (and high-tech drive thrus) to reflect that new reality.

His younger brother, now almost three, also became infected and got very ill.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We had gone without family, we had gone without friends, we had gone without everything. My youngest wasn't even in daycare yet,\" said Laing, who lives in Wilmot Township in the Waterloo, Ont., region.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I was -- I think, fairly understandably -- really annoyed that this had been the situation that my family had been put in.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLaing found other concerned parents, including an epidemiologist, who had formed a group called Ontario School Safety. She volunteered to help and is now the group's chair.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt's one of several grassroots groups of parents, health-care workers and teachers that have sprung up across Canada to lobby for safer schools, including improved air quality. Although protecting students and education workers against COVID-19 was the main driver when they started, other viruses such as flu and RSV -- plus wildfire smoke and other air pollutants -- have also become key concerns in the quest for cleaner air in classrooms.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"A lot of us got, you know, 'armchair degrees' in mechanical and ventilation engineering to try to understand what the crux of the problem was and how we might start addressing some of these things. And it became clear that indoor air quality is about so much more than just COVID-19,\" Laing said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAmanda Hu, spokesperson for parent advocacy group Fresh Air Schools Alberta, agreed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's been a struggle because the things that we've pushed for during COVID that have only become more important when we have (this) confluence of air quality issues, have still not been done,\" Hu said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of the most effective ways to protect kids and teachers against the dual threat of viruses and polluted air is better ventilation coupled with air filtration, parent groups and air quality experts say.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The no-brainer that works in every school is a good portable filter in every space that's sized appropriately for the space,\" said Jeffrey Siegel, a civil engineering professor specializing in air quality at the University of Toronto.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThose can be HEPA -- high efficiency particulate air -- filters, Siegel said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut well-constructed do-it-yourself units using a box fan and four good furnace filters also work, he said. They're often referred to as \"Corsi-Rosenthal boxes.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The important thing is to have a decent filter that's moving a lot of air in the space,\" Siegel said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough HEPA filters provide the highest quality of filtration, the do-it-yourself versions are also effective if the filters used are at least MERV 13-rated, he said. MERV stands for \"minimum efficiency reporting values\" and is a measure of how efficiently the filter captures particles.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThey also need to be sealed tightly so that all air going into the box has to pass through the filters rather than going around them.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn addition, schools can check to see if their HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) systems can be upgraded with MERV 13 quality filters, Siegel said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut he noted that in many cases, it may be more cost effective to put a high-quality air filter in every classroom.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRoger Haskett, a father of three in Vancouver, has been fighting to put HEPA or even homemade air filters into classrooms.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe volunteers as the air quality co-ordinator with the Vancouver District Parents Advisory Council. Haskett said he sees some hope for progress now that governments are looking at ways to improve air quality in light of the growing threats from wildfire smoke.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUnlike viruses, pollution from smoke is something people can see in the air, he said, and therefore seems less \"politicized\" than the discussion around COVID-19 prevention in schools.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We can fight wildfire smoke and by fighting it, we can bring clean air into the classroom, which solves a whole bunch of other problems,\" Haskett said. \"We're also dealing with viruses and airborne illnesses (at the same time).\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor Siegel, a big part of the issue is how governments and school boards look at air quality in schools.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We often think about things from the cost perspective. How much is it going to cost to put a good filter in the classroom? How much is it going to cost to upgrade the HVAC?\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The real thing we should be looking at is what's the cost of not doing it?\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn response to an inquiry by The Canadian Press, the office of Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce provided a memo sent to all the province's school boards on Sept. 5.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe memo said the province requires a standalone HEPA filter \"in every kindergarten class (and) in all learning spaces in schools without mechanical ventilation and (in) mechanically ventilated spaces that are not supported by MERV-13 filters.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOntario has invested over $665 million to improve air quality in schools and deployed over 100,000 HEPA units, said Grace Lee, the minister's spokesperson, in an emailed statement.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe government is also investing \"nearly $30 million for the coming school year\" to support measures such as installing higher-grade filters, she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We expect school boards to continue using HEPA filter units and optimizing air flow with the highest quality filters in the 2023-24 school year,\" Lee said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut the Ontario School Safety group said that parents, teachers and other education workers across the province are reporting that the filters aren't getting into classrooms -- or if they do, they're often turned off. Laing and two other members of the group said their own children do not have HEPA filters in their classrooms.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPart of the problem could be a lack of education for teachers about the importance of the classroom air filters and how to use them to get maximum benefit, as well as troubleshooting, Siegel said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHis own daughter excitedly told him that there was a HEPA filter in her classroom, he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I asked her about it, you know, two or three days later and she said, 'oh yeah, yeah, it was too noisy. We turned it off.\"'\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIssues like noise can be easily fixed, Siegel said. For example, instead of running one big HEPA filter for the whole classroom, he suggested using a couple of smaller, strategically placed HEPA filters, such as one by the teacher and one in the middle of students' desks.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat's because the noise is usually caused by the amount of air being moved, Siegel said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn Alberta, there doesn't appear to be any direction on the use of HEPA filters in schools from the provincial government.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Edmonton public school board adopted HEPA filters while the Calgary public school board did not, said Hu of Fresh Air Schools Alberta.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA recent back-to-school notice posted on the Edmonton Public Schools website said there are \"portable air filtration (HEPA) units for every classroom and learning space.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn an emailed statement, the Calgary Board of Education said, \"all CBE schools are mechanically ventilated and systems are set to maximize air exchange.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe board upgraded to MERV 13 filters on its ventilation equipment \"whenever possible,\" the statement said\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"With these measures in place, the CBE's position regarding portable air cleaning devices remains unchanged at this time,\" it said, noting the board is \"fully compliant with all provincial direction and legislated requirements.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHu, who lives in Calgary, started fighting for better air quality in public schools when her daughter was two years old, \"because I thought that maybe we'd get traction (by) the time she started kindergarten.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHer daughter is now five and Hu drives her half an hour each way to a private school that has adopted air filtration.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"That is not fair and that's not equitable for kids who go to public school (in Calgary),\" she said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough both education and health fall under provincial jurisdiction, Health Canada is \"currently developing new indoor air quality guidance for schools in Canada,\" a spokesperson said in an email.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It will provide recommendations and best practices for improving indoor air quality in schools, including improving ventilation and filtration, based on the latest science and information available.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA draft of that guidance is expected to be available for public comment next spring or summer, Health Canada said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 12, 2023.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Walter would become the inspiration for some of his most sought-after canvases, drawings and sculptures.\n \n As time went on, Picasso found it increasingly difficult to hide his feelings for Walter from his work—something that became clear during his first large-scale retrospective and finally ended his marriage.\n \n The artist painted “Femme à la montre” in August 1932, soon after the retrospective at the Galerie Georges Petit in Paris ended.\n \n According to Sotheby’s, “the sense of release from keeping secrets about his affair seem to have spilled out onto this extraordinary canvas, in which he gives full painterly rein to new-found freedoms, drenching the painting in strong primary colors and beautiful forms, while at the same time paying careful attention to every small detail, creating a composition that is both intensely complex and deeply harmonious.”\n \n Picasso died in 1973, and Walter in 1977.\n \n \nAndy Warhol's 1986 self portrait will also be auctioned as part of Fisher Landau's collection (Sotheby's via CNN)\n \n The painting is one of about 120 from the collection of Fisher Landau, a world renowned contemporary art collector who died earlier this year aged 102, according to \nThe Art Newspaper\n.\n \n The collection, which also includes works by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning and Georgia O’Keeffe, is expected to sell for more than $400 million overall.\n \n  \n \n5 Things to Know newsletter: Sign up to start your day with the top stories\n \n \n Fisher Landau’s began seriously collecting after receiving an insurance payout following an armed robbery of her jewelery at her New York home in 1969.\n \n In an interview for an exhibition catalog, quoted in the Sotheby’s statement, she said of the episode: “Even though Lloyds of London paid up, there was no way to replace that collection. It was so beautiful. And they got it in one fell swoop…. I was devastated. But I decided that I didn’t want the jewelry any more. I now had seed money for a collection.”\n \n \nArt collector Emily Fisher Landau died earlier this year, aged 102. She is pictured here in front of Fernand Léger's \"Étude pour Les Constructeurs\" in her home in Manhattan in 2002. (Sotheby's via CNN)\n \n Last year, Picasso’s most curious painting of Walter, in which she appears as a tentacled sea creature, sold for $67.5 million at Sotheby’s in New York.\n \n Picasso’s portraits of Walter have become highly sought-after, with his other 1932 works “Femme assise près d’une fenêtre (Marie-Thérèse),” selling for $103.41 million in 2021, and “Nude, Green Leaves and Bust,” selling for $106.5 million in 2010.\n \n In May 2015, Picasso’s “Les femmes d’Alger (Version “O”) sold at Christie’s in New York for $179.4 million—at that time, the highest price ever paid for a work of art at auction.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

A Russian Soyuz capsule is not expected to return him and his two fellow crewmates — cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin — to Earth before September 27.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat means Rubio will have spent at least 371 days in orbit once he completes his mission. He is on the cusp of becoming the first American to spend more than one calendar year in microgravity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tYet Rubio’s mission was not originally designed to break records.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen Rubio left for the space station aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule on September 21, 2022, he and his crewmates believed they were carrying out a six-month mission. But the spacecraft that carried Rubio and his two Russian colleagues \nsprang a coolant leak\n in December. Officials at Roscosmos, Russia’s space agency, later deemed the spacecraft unsafe to carry the crew back home.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInstead, the Soyuz MS-22 capsule returned to Earth without a crew on March 28. And Roscosmos launched a replacement spacecraft, MS-23, that \ndocked\n with the space station on February 25. Rubio’s return date was pushed back to September as Russia prepared the next Soyuz vehicle, which will launch with a new crew of two cosmonauts and one NASA astronaut as early as Friday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTo commemorate Rubio’s feat, he recorded a conversation with Vande Hei on September 5. NASA is expected to air the footage on Tuesday at 11 a.m. ET on its \nmedia channel\n.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Rubio’s journey in space embodies the essence of exploration,” NASA administrator Bill Nelson said in a Monday \nstatement\n posted on social media.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“As he breaks records as the longest serving @NASA US astronaut in space, he also paves the way for future generations of astronauts,” the statement reads. “Your dedication is truly out of this world, Frank!”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIN THE RECORD BOOKS\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf all goes to plan, and Rubio departs on September 27, his 371-day stay will not be a world record for the longest space mission. The late Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who logged 437 continuous days in orbit aboard Russia’s Mir space station between January 1994 and March 1995, holds that title.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tVande Hei had set a new U.S. record for the most consecutive days in space in 2022 after NASA and Roscosmos decided to extend his stay because Russia had sent a crew of two people to the space station to film a movie. Vande Hei’s return was delayed to allow for the additional traffic to the orbiting laboratory, though he \nsaid\n at the time that he had known his mission might be extended before he arrived.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBefore Vande Hei, U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly held the title for longest spaceflight by an American with his 340-day mission. That tour of duty was a planned extended mission, designed by NASA to \nstudy the long-term effects\n of spaceflight on the human body.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA Russian cosmonaut also holds the current record for the most cumulative days in space. Gennadi Padalka \nearned\n that title, besting another cosmonaut in 2015, by notching a total of 879 days over the course of five separate spaceflights.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe U.S. record for the most accrued days in space is held by Peggy Whitson with a total of 675 days in orbit. Whitson, who \nretired\n from the NASA astronaut corps in 2018, has added to the record as recently as 2023. She now serves as a private astronaut for Axiom Space, which so far has hosted \ntwo commercial trips\n to the space station that have allowed paying customers to experience a trip to the orbiting laboratory alongside a veteran professional astronaut.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGETTING TO SPACE\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRubio travelled to the space station on a Russian spacecraft as part of \ncrew-swapping agreement\n between NASA and Roscosmos that was hashed out in the summer of 2022.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNASA officials assigned Rubio to ride aboard the Soyuz MS-22, while Roscosmos put cosmonaut Anna Kikina on a \nSpaceX Crew Dragon mission\n that took flight in October 2022 and \nreturned home\n March 11.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDespite geopolitical tensions between the United States and Russia as the war in Ukraine escalated, NASA has repeatedly said its partnership with Roscosmos is vital to continuing the space station’s operations and the valuable scientific research carried out on board.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt the time the ride-sharing agreement was announced, NASA said in a statement that inking such a deal with Russia was crucial to ensure “continued safe operations” of the space station. If either the Russian Soyuz spacecraft or the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule were to run into issues and be taken out of service, a seat-swap agreement would ensure that both U.S. astronauts and Russian cosmonauts would still have access to the space station.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRoscosmos did not need to rely on a SpaceX capsule to replace the damaged Soyuz MS-22 crew ship, however, because the MS-23 spacecraft was prepared to fly and the coolant leak on the MS-22 vehicle did not necessarily point to possible issues with other Soyuz vehicles, officials noted.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJoel Montalbano, NASA’s International Space Station program manager, said during a news conference in July that Roscosmos had investigated the issue and found it was likely an “external force” that caused the leak, indicating a piece of orbital debris probably hit the spacecraft.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“A NASA team has also looked at it independent of the Russian team and we also cannot find anything — based on the information we’ve been given by our Russian colleagues — of anything other than some type of external force or debris or something else like that,” Montalbano said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDuring his stay in space, Rubio has seen several crews of astronauts rotate through via SpaceX vehicles. Apart from the Axiom-2 crew that visited in May, the SpaceX Crew-6 astronauts have \ncome and gone\n since Rubio’s arrival. And the Crew-7 group — which includes astronauts from NASA, Roscosmos, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the European Space Agency — \narrived\n at the station in August.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEditor's note: \nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. \nExplore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more\n.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Or why tech billionaire Elon Musk is being featured in an ad promoting an investment opportunity that sounds too good to be true?\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNo matter how convincing it may have looked, the video is likely a deepfake, a term that refers to media manipulated or fabricated using artificial intelligence.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJeff Horncastle, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre's (CAFC) client and communications officer, is warning Canadians about rising video and audio scams that use the likeness of media personalities to advertise fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms and other scams.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"All (fraudsters) need is a little bit of audio from the person who they want to deepfake, potentially a photo or short audio clip, and they use that as an extra tool to try to convince potential victims that it's a real,\" Horncastle told CTV National News.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThese fraudsters often draw on household names to build trust, such as U.S. TV personalities Gayle King, Tucker Carlson and Bill Maher.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDeepfake videos advertising scams on YouTube have also featured CTV National News's own Chief News Anchor and Senior Editor Omar Sachedina. One of these ads appears to show Sachedina presenting a news item, but instead praising a cannabis company. The audio, while well-matched to the video, is fake.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnother video shows Tesla founder Elon Musk selling stock in fraudulent crypto companies.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough the AI technology behind this isn't new, it’s becoming easier to access apps and websites that can be used to generate convincing fake images, videos and audio clips featuring familiar faces.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSimilar to with \nrobocalls and spam emails\n, the creators of these deepfake videos have \nscammed people out of thousands of dollars\n. While there isn't any concrete data on how many Canadians have been scammed specifically with deepfake content, the \nCAFC reported in 2022\n that Canadians lost a total of $531 million to fraud. As of June, Canadians have lost $283.5 million this year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAI IS ONLY GETTING 'BETTER,' MAKING SCAMS WORSE\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAside from their eerily realistic look, the most frightening aspect of these deepfakes is that the technology is only getting better, making it harder for a person to identify a fake, says technology expert Mark Daley.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The important point to remember is the deepfakes you see now are going to be the worst you're ever going to see for the rest of your life. It's only going to get better,\" Daley, who is the chief digital information officer at Western University, told CTV National News.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDaley explains advancing technology has intensified in the last five years, as creating a deepfake used to require a highly skilled individual with access to exclusive technical software. Now, anyone with an average knowledge of AI and access to a gaming computer can spread misinformation through the likeness a well-known figure, such as a politician running for office.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nWorld needs to be 'vigilant' as AI technology improves and deepfakes spread: UN adviser\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis disinformation is particularly alarming to psychotherapist and tech journalist Georgia Dow, who says fabricated videos can feed into people's hate for certain groups and individuals, or sway them to believing something their favourite celebrity appeared to say during an interview that never really happened.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's almost like those revenge fantasies. People we don't like, we want to see in certain situations, people we do like, we want to see in certain situations. These produce a lot of clicks and people are now trying to get that social currency,\" Dow told CTV National News.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of the ways this technology can be harmful is when used amid important political events.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor example, ahead of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, potential candidates are already seeing videos of themselves working against their campaigns. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is currently seeking a nomination for the Republican Party, was seen in a deepfake video last week appearing to announce that he would be dropping out of the race.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's really kind of planted little tiny seeds in our head that perhaps this person is nefarious, or perhaps they have alternative feelings. I think that politically this is a really big deal,\" Dow said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRecently, \nGoogle announced\n it would using its own technology to add watermark warnings to AI-generated images in an effort to shut down false claims and denounce phony photographs; however, the concern over the potential spread of disinformation exists even with efforts such as these.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a statement to CTV News, a spokesperson for the company said: “We’re committed to keeping people safe on our platforms and when we find content that violates these policies we take action.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We continue to enhance our enforcement practices to combat abuse and fraud. We’ve launched new certification policies, ramped up advertiser verification, and increased our capacity to detect and prevent co-ordinated scams in recent years.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHOW TO SPOT A DEEPFAKE\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs technology advances, experts say it's important for people to question the media they consume online. Red flags that suggest a video could be fake include audio that doesn’t match a person's mouth movements, video that features unnatural eye movements and differences in lighting on the person talking and the background.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDow also advised focusing on the \"outline\" of a person compared to the background, including their hair and areas around their face, especially when the speaker is moving.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHorncastle recommended asking questions about why certain media personalities would be promoting products outside of their interest, and why they would be promoting anything at all if it's not something they normally do.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The first red flag should be, 'I'm thinking this celebrity isn't promoting this stuff,'\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"And if you're still not sure, do as much research as you can, but chances are that these websites that they're promoting are fraudulent.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHorncastle says researching the companies behind these products before buying from them will provide insight on how legitimate they are and where exactly your money could be going.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

It is also one of the few remaining slivers of hope for the relatives of the missing -- like Sophia Stavrinou.\n \n Her father was last seen on Aug. 14, 1974, when he and fellow Greek Cypriot soldiers retreated from a massive Turkish military advance. The remains of soldiers who were with Stavrinou's father that day have been found and returned to their relatives. But not those of her father.\n \n \nEmitting radio waves, the machine is probing for any disturbances through layers of soil beneath the asphalt to offer any clues supporting eyewitness accounts that people who vanished nearly a half century ago are buried in a makeshift mass grave, now squeezed between a two-story home and a fig orchard. (AP Photo/Petros Karadjias)\n \n \"There's hope,\" she said. \"To be honest, I don't know if it will happen.\"\n \n The committee, comprised of a Greek Cypriot, a Turkish Cypriot and a rotating member appointed by the United Nations, is looking to use the high-tech gear to help save both time and money in the search.\n \n Bruce Koepke, special assistant to the committee's U.N.-appointed member, says the machinery is expensive but that it's worth investing in the radar.\n \n \"Witnesses are dying, so we need to use this technology,\" he said.\n \n On the breakaway Turkish Cypriot side of the island, in the village of Exo Metochi, or Duzova in Turkish, the radar is busy collecting images from below ground along a road squeezed between a two-story home and a fig orchard.\n \n Harry M. Jol, a geography and anthropology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, which owns the pulseEkko, says that subsequent computer analysis of the images could reveal soil \"anomalies,\" possibly caused by digging for a burial site.\n \n Pinpointing such anomalies could then help divert resources to \"promising\" sites instead of costly and time-consuming excavations that may yield no results, Jol told The Associated Press.\n \n \"If you can look down at a depth of a meter\" in the images the radar collected, \"that could be a year's worth of excavation work,\" said Jol, a Canadian citizen who is volunteering on the project in Cyprus together with his son and assistant Connor.\n \n The two were looking at four sites in Cyprus over a week's time, with the committee only covering their travel expenses and accommodations.\n \n Yagmur Erbolay, a committee investigation coordinator, said an earlier dig at the orchard site abutting the road found nothing. But a second search was launched using the pulseEkko after consistent eyewitness accounts indicated several Greek Cypriots could be buried there.\n \n For Jol, it's the second time he has travelled to Cyprus to test out the radar.\n \n A trip last year produced few tangible results, but now they are using a more powerful version of the radar, which can probe deeper into the ground.\n \n If proven effective, it could convince the committee to purchase its own machinery.\n \n \"We're still testing the equipment and once the determination is made, the committee will meet to decide on whether to purchase the equipment,\" said Koepke.\n \n Of the 2,002 people who disappeared in Cyprus between 1963 and 1974, the remains of 1,033 have been identified and returned to their families since search efforts began in earnest in 2006.\n \n That marks the second-best success rate in the world, after the former Yugoslavia, where thousands disappeared during the ethnic wars in the 1990s that accompanied the country's breakup, according to Paul-Henri Arni, the committee's outgoing U.N.-appointed member.\n \n Deciphering the fate of those still missing -- 769 Greek Cypriots and 200 Turkish Cypriots -- is a huge challenge.\n \n \"Now we have the hard cases when somebody was killed in one location, taken in a pickup truck 20 kilometres (12 miles) away and buried without (a) witness in a second location,\" Arni told reporters last week.\n \n With imprecise and less-than-reliable information on burial sites, technology is seen as key to expediting excavations by ruling out areas where there's little or no evidence of soil disturbances.\n \n New technology, such as GPR, can pinpoint the search for potential grave sites where the topography has changed significantly from how witnesses remember them, said Nikos Sergides, president of the Organization of Relatives of the Missing.\n \n \"We hope that any new technology that's employed can expedite the process and that's more important to relatives now than ever,\" Sergides told the AP.\n \n Testing the pulseEkko is key for the committee, which relies on international donations to support its 3.2 million euro budget ($3.4 million), mostly funded by the European Union.\n \n Jol, who participated in searches for Holocaust victims in Latvia, said the technology could be a game-changer for burial sites in other former conflict zones.\n \n The whole point of his work, Jol said, is to offer closure to the families of the missing by \"working myself out of a job.\"\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He had suffered numerous health issues in recent decades.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nFrom 2017: W5 follows Gordon Lightfoot on tour\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tConsidered one of the most renowned voices to emerge from Toronto's Yorkville folk club scene in the 1960s, Lightfoot went on to record no less than 20 studio albums and pen hundreds of songs, including \"Early Morning Rain,\" \"Carefree Highway\" and \"Sundown.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We have lost one of our greatest singer-songwriters,\" tweeted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau late Monday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Gordon Lightfoot captured our country's spirit in his music -- and in doing so, he helped shape Canada's soundscape. May his music continue to inspire future generations, and may his legacy live on forever.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOther celebrities and politicians added their praises of Lightfoot's craft on Twitter. Author Stephen King described him as \"a wonderful performer,\" while the Beach Boys co-founder Brian Wilson added a simple \"rest in peace.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFormer Ontario premier Bob Rae said he was \"such a decent man\" and a \"musician with a magnificent tenor voice that will last forever\" while Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield said his \"poetry and melodies are an eternal inspiration.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOnce called a \"rare talent\" by Bob Dylan, Lightfoot's timeless compositions have transcended the boundaries of generations and musical genres.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDozens of artists have covered his work, including Elvis Presley, Barbra Streisand, Harry Belafonte, Johnny Cash, Anne Murray, Jane's Addiction, Sarah McLachlan and, perhaps most surprisingly, dance supergroup Stars on 54 who turned his classic \"If You Could Read My Mind\" into a disco-pop curiosity for the 1998 movie \"54.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMost of his songs are deeply autobiographical with lyrics that probe his own experiences in a frank and unclouded manner and explore issues surrounding the national identity.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHis 1975 song \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" chronicled the demise of a Great Lakes ore freighter, and 1966's \"Canadian Railroad Trilogy\" depicted the construction of the railway.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I simply write the songs about where I am and where I'm from,\" he once said. \"I take situations and write poems about them.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOften described as a poetic storyteller, Lightfoot remained keenly aware of his cultural influence. It was a role he took very seriously.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I just like to stay there and be a part of the totem pole and look after the responsibilities I've acquired over the years,\" he said in a 2001 interview.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut he was humble about his status: \"How does it feel to be an icon? It makes me feel no different as a human entity on the face of the planet.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile Lightfoot's parents recognized his musical talents early on, he didn't set out to become a renowned balladeer.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe began singing in his church choir and dreamed of becoming a jazz musician. At age 13, the soprano won a talent contest at the Kiwanis Music Festival, held at Toronto's Massey Hall.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I remember the thrill of being in front of the crowd,\" Lightfoot said in a 2018 interview.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It was a stepping stone for me... My father was doing all my driving. I was doing events all around. I was playing at weddings, all the various clubs, the Ladies' Auxiliary.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe appeal of those early days stuck and in high school, his barbershop quartet, The Collegiate Four, won a CBC talent competition. He strummed his first guitar in 1956 and began to dabble in songwriting in the months that followed. Perhaps distracted by his taste for music, he flunked algebra the first time. After taking the class again, he graduated in 1957.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBy then, Lightfoot had already penned his first serious composition -- \"The Hula Hoop Song,\" inspired by the popular kids' toy that was sweeping the culture. Attempts to sell the song went nowhere so at 18, he headed to the U.S. to study music for a year. The trip was funded in part by money saved from a job delivering linens to resorts around his hometown.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLife in Hollywood wasn't a good fit, however, and it wasn't long before a homesick Lightfoot returned to Canada. He pledged to move to Toronto to pursue his musical ambitions, taking any job available, including a position at Royal Bank before landing a role as a square dancer on CBC's \"Country Hoedown.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of his first gigs was at Fran's Restaurant, a downtown family-owned diner that warmed to his folk sensibilities. It was there he met fellow musician Ronnie Hawkins, who urged him to take his music to more suitable places, such as nearby Steele's Tavern.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt that point, Lightfoot was living with a few buddies in a condemned building in Yorkville, then a bohemian area where future stars including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell would learn their trade at smoke-filled clubs. Around that time, he befriended local folk duo Ian and Sylvia who became great admirers of his work and later recorded two of his songs as his star first began to rise.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLightfoot made his popular radio debut with the single \"(Remember Me) I'm the One\" in 1962, which led to a number of hit songs and partnerships with other local musicians. When he started playing the Mariposa Folk Festival in his hometown of Orillia, Ont., that same year, Lightfoot forged a relationship that made him the festival's most loyal returning performer.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBy 1964, he was garnering positive word-of-mouth around town that attracted Bernie Fiedler, owner of Yorkville's Riverboat coffee house, who showed up at one of Lightfoot's Steele's performances with an offer to pay him double.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAudiences were starting to gather in growing numbers and by the next year, Lightfoot's song \"I'm Not Sayin\"' was a hit in Canada, which helped spread his name in the United States.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA couple of covers by other artists didn't hurt either. Marty Robbins' 1965 recording of \"Ribbon of Darkness\" reached No. 1 on U.S. country charts, while Peter, Paul and Mary took Lightfoot's composition, \"For Lovin' Me,\" into the U.S. Top 30. The song, which Dylan once said he wished he'd recorded, has since been covered by hundreds of others.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThat summer, Lightfoot performed at the Newport Folk Festival, the same year Dylan rattled audiences when he shed his folkie persona by playing an electric guitar.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs the folk music boom came to an end in the late 1960s, Lightfoot was already making his transition to pop music with ease.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn 1971, he made his first appearance on the Billboard chart with \"If You Could Read My Mind,\" a reflection on a failing marriage likened to \"an old-time movie about a ghost from a wishing well.\" It reached No. 5 and has since spawned scores of covers.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLightfoot's popularity peaked in the mid-1970s when both his single and album, \"Sundown,\" topped the Billboard charts, his first and only time doing so.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue came to Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in 1975, Lightfoot was invited on stage. Afterwards, he hosted a party for the crew at his home where he was filming singing his folk contemporary's \"Ballad In Plain D,\" which later appeared in Dylan's pseudo-documentary \"Renaldo and Clara.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut with Lightfoot's intense fame came public intrusions into his private life. His 1973 divorce from Swedish wife Brita Ingegerd Olaisson made headlines and was branded as the costliest divorce settlement in Canadian legal history at the time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"When my first marriage broke up, it took me years to get over it,\" he recalled in 2012 with The Canadian Press.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I had a good wife and two great kids, but the business just ate me up. The women ate me up. I wasn't able to resist. I can now, but not then. And then it was alcohol, and there's no greater catalyst to getting into further (trouble) than drinking.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIndeed, Lightfoot endured a very public battle with alcoholism and other personal hurdles, particularly with the women who inspired his lyrics.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHis 1975 album \"Cold on the Shoulder\" purportedly reflects on his broken relationship with Cathy Smith, a troubled former girlfriend who lingered in his mind long after they broke up.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSeven years after its release, Smith was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving comedian John Belushi a fatal dose of drugs. The story was splashed across the tabloids and drew Lightfoot into the scandal.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe resented being painted as a drug user, saying he dated Smith more than a decade earlier, long before her hard drug use. But he also felt an obligation to help her get back on her feet. He gave her money after her jail sentence ended in 1988 and made the publishing connections for her memoir.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLightfoot went on to marry Elizabeth Moon in 1989. While his second marriage produced two children, the couple ultimately divorced in 2011.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThree years later he wed Kim Hasse, an Iowa-raised woman who he'd met at several shows. Despite their 23-year age difference, the pair became inseparable with Hasse frequently by Lightfoot's side at public events.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's actually quite surprising, I never thought I'd have a girlfriend again for as long as I've lived,\" he said at the time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLightfoot is survived by Hasse and his six children and several grandchildren.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDuring his career, Lightfoot collected 12 Juno Awards, including one in 1970 when it was called the Gold Leaf. He was also named four times as top folk singer at the RPM Awards -- the 1960s predecessor to the Junos. He was nominated for four Grammy Awards, received an Order of Canada citation in 1970 at the age of 32, and was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 2003.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn 1986, he was inducted into the Canadian Recording Industry Hall of Fame, now the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. He received the Governor General's Award in 1997 and was ushered into the Canadian Country Music Hall Of Fame in 2001.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn top of his musical accomplishments, Lightfoot branched out into acting with the 1982 Canadian film \"Harry Tracy, Desperado,\" starring Bruce Dern and Helen Shaver. Later in the decade, he appeared on an episode of prime-time soap \"Hotel,\" where he tapped into his own experience to play a musician struggling with alcoholism.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMuch of his late career was marred by persistent health problems that slowed -- but rarely stopped -- him from performing live.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn 2002, he suffered an aortic aneurysm and later fell into a coma, endured more surgery and a rehabilitation period that he says stretched for two and a half years. He later said the health scare took \"some of the starch\" out of his voice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA minor stroke that hit in 2006 made it difficult for him to use his right hand while playing guitar for a short while.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tStill, he continued touring. A strict workout regimen of six days a week helped him stay in shape.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn early 2010, Lightfoot learned of his own death when the CanWest newspaper chain splashed the false headline across some of their websites. The media company picked up on social media buzz that was eventually traced back to a prank call made to the management office of late singer and friend Ronnie Hawkins.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLightfoot took the hoax in stride, saying he learned of his demise as he was driving back from a dentist appointment.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I was quite surprised to hear it myself,\" he told CP24 with a chuckle.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSix years later, Lightfoot crossed the finish line on an astounding 80 tour dates in one year. He said his three alternating setlists were so meticulously focused that they all ran two hours and five minutes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"At this age, my challenge is doing the best show I can,\" he said in an interview with CP.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I'm very much improved from where I was and the seriousness with which I take it.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHowever, a lifetime of touring came at a hefty personal price that left him with guilt he still carried in his later years.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I was not always the dad I should've been,\" he acknowledged, reflecting on his absence from raising his six kids.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I've worked hard on improving that for many years now.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt 79, he quit smoking. \"Cigarettes, that is,\" he specified in a 2019 conversation. And despite a fall at home that forced him to postpone dates in mid-2021, he was back on stage four months later to reopen the renovated Massey Hall in a three-night engagement.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThose shows kicked off another tour that ran well into the following year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn early April, representatives for the singer announced he was cancelling all of his upcoming concerts due to unspecified health setbacks.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLightfoot's hometown enshrined his musical legacy in bronze when they unveiled a four-metre-high sculpture dedicated to him. It was one of several local honours he would receive later in his life.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"When I found out they were working on it, I thought, 'Why me? What have I done that is so great that I should deserve to have a statue, a very artistic work done?\"' he said at the time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"To have a monument of this kind and the location here (at) the Mariposa Folk Festival ... It's very appropriate.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 1, 2023\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The malaise is a key reason Apple's stock price has dipped by about 10 per cent since mid-July, dropping the company's market value below the US$3 trillion threshold it reached for the first time earlier this summer.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tInvestors apparently weren't impressed with what Apple rolled out Tuesday. The company's shares fell nearly 2 per cent Tuesday, a steeper decline than the major market indexes.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs has been the case with Apple and other smartphone makers, the four types of iPhone 15 models aren't making any major leaps in technology. But Apple added enough new bells and whistles to the top-of-the-line model -- the iPhone 15 Pro Max -- to boost its starting price by US$100, or 9 per cent, from last year's version to US$1,200. As part of the higher base price, the cheapest iPhone 15 Pro Max will provide 256 megabytes of storage, up from 128 megabytes for the least expensive version of the iPhone 14 Pro Max.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tApple is holding the line on prices for the rest of the lineup, with the basic iPhone 15 selling for US$800, the iPhone 15 Plus for US$900 and the iPhone 15 Pro for US$1,000.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough maintaining those prices is bound to squeeze Apple's profit margins and put further pressure on the company's stock price, Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro believes it's a prudent move with still-high inflation and spiking interest rates pinching household budgets. \"The reality was that Apple found itself in a challenging position leading up to this event,\" Monteiro said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnd the price hike for the iPhone 15 Pro Max could help Apple boost sales if consumers continue to gravitate toward the company's premium models. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives expects the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max to account for about 75 per cent of the device's total sales in the upcoming year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAll the new models will be available in stores Sept. 22, with pre-orders beginning this Friday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne of the biggest changes that Apple announced is a new way to charge the iPhone 15 models and future generations. The company is switching to the USB-C standard that is already widely used on many devices, including its Mac computers and many of its iPads.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tApple is being forced to phase out the Lightning port cables it rolled out in 2012 because of a mandate that European regulators plan to impose in 2024.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAlthough consumers often don't like change, the transition to USB-C ports may not be that inconvenient. That's because the standard is already widely used on a range of computers, smartphones and other devices people already own. The shift to USB-C may even be a popular move since that standard typically charges devices more quickly and also offers faster data transfer speeds.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe basic iPhone 15 models have been redesigned to include a shape-shifting cutout on the display screen that Apple calls its \"Dynamic Island\" for app notifications -- a look that was introduced with last year's Pro and Pro Max devices. The basic models are also getting a faster chip used in last year's Pro and Pro Max models, while the next generation of the premium iPhone 15s will run on an even more advanced processor that will enable the devices to accommodate the same kind of video games that typically require a console.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max also will be equipped with what Apple maintains is the equivalent of seven camera lenses. They will include a periscope-style telephoto lens that will improve the quality of photos taken from far distances. The telephoto lens boasts a 5x optical zoom, which lags the 10x optical zoom on Samsung's premium Galaxy S22 Ultra, but represents an upgrade from the 3x optical zoom on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn anticipation of next year's release of Apple's mixed reality headset, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will also have a spatial video option designed for viewing on that headset.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tApple is encasing the premium models in titanium which the company says is the same alloy used on some spaceships.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBesides its new iPhones, Apple also announced its next generation of smartwatches -- a product that made its debut nearly a decade ago. The Series 9 Apple Watch, available in stores Sept. 22, will include a new gesture control that will enable users to control alarms and answer phone calls by double snapping their thumbs with a finger.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The teeth are believed to be around 25 million years old.\n \n Named Lumakoala blackae, this small animal \"probably ate mostly soft leaves, but wouldn’t have turned down an insect given the chance,” Crichton \nsaid in a press release Thursday.\n \n “Our computer analysis of its evolutionary relationships indicates that Lumakoala is a member of the koala family (Phascolarctidae) or a close relative, but it also resembles several much older fossil marsupials called Thylacotinga and Chulpasia from the 55 million-year-old Tingamarra site in northeastern Australia.\"\n \n  \n \nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n \n \n The Pwerte Marnte Marnte fossil site is thought to be the site containing the oldest terrestrial mammals from the Oligocene (around 33.7 million years ago to 23.8 million years ago), which can be found in Australia.\n \n The discovery of Lumakoala blackae comes from field samples collected from the site in 2014 and 2020 and analyzed by Crichton. Although Pwerte Marnte Marnte contains a wealth of fossils, it's difficult to remove them from the limestone. These fossils were processed from 2020 to 2022 at the Flinders University Palaeontology Lab using acid, rock saws and other mechanical tools to painstakingly release the fossils from the stone.\n \n The field samples also contained fossils from two other early koala relatives, Madakoala and Nimiokoala, which are also described in the study.\n \n The similarities between Lumakoala blackae's molars and those of older marsupials found in the Tingamarra site suggest that Lumakoala blackae could be one of the intermediary stages of evolution between those marsupials and the modern day koala.\n \n \nComparison of upper molar morphology between Chulpasia jimthorselli, Lumakoala blackae and the modern koala. (A. Crichton / Flinders University)\n \n “These Tingamarran marsupials are less mysterious than we thought, and now appear to be ancient relatives of younger, more familiar groups like koalas,” Robin Beck, associate professor from England's University of Salford and co-author of the paper, said in the press release.\n \n “It shows how finding new fossils like Lumakoala, even if only a few teeth, can revolutionise our understanding of the history of life on Earth.”\n \n It's an exciting link in an evolutionary chain that has long been shrouded in mystery.\n \n Australia is home to many unique animals not found anywhere else in the world, including an incredibly diverse range of marsupials.\n \n Diprotodontia is the largest order of marsupials, including kangaroos, wallabies, possums, koalas, wombats and many others, totalling around 155 species.\n \n \"This group (Diprotodontia)is extremely diverse today, but nothing is known about the first half of their evolution due to a long gap in the fossil record,\" Crichton said in the release.\n \n Molecular analysis suggests that Diprotondontia diverged from Agreodontia — an umbrella order of marsupials which includes species that later evolved into modern-day bandicoots, Tasmanian devils and numbats, among others — sometime between the late Cretaceous period (from roughly 100.5 million years ago to 66 million years ago) and the earliest middle Eocene (roughly 47.8 million years ago).\n \n This means they would've diverged before Australia had completely finished separating from Antarctica, which only happened 30 million years ago. Australia and Antarctica were the last remaining pieces of the supercontinent Gondwana to separate from one another.\n \n After separation, what followed was a long period of isolation for Australia, which allowed for the increasingly diverse evolution of marsupials and other species.\n \n However, there's a lack of marsupial fossils from prior to the late Oliocene, making it hard to follow the path of evolution between much older fossils and newer ones. The key similarities found between Lumakoala's molars and two 55-million-year-old species potentially offer a way across that gap.\n \n Thylacotinga and Chulpasia are small marsupials whose familial relationships have long been speculated to lie in South America, as it used to be part of Gondwana. Fossils similar to Chulpasia have also been found in Peru.\n \n “In the past, it was suggested the enigmatic Thylacotinga and Chulpasia may have been closely related to marsupials from South America,\" Crichton said. “However, the discovery of Lumakoala suggests that Thylacotinga and Chulpasia could actually be early relatives of Australian herbivorous marsupials such as koalas, wombats, kangaroos and possums.\n \n “If our hypothesis is correct, it would extend the Diprotodontian fossil record back by 30 million years.\"\n \n The study raises the question of whether the koala's roots can be traced back to South American and Antarctica. This discovery is also the first time that an ancient relative of the koala has been found in Australia’s Northern Territory.\n \n Although there is only one modern species of koala, there used to be many, with at least seven having been identified as active in the late Oligocene. \n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

All 100 senators are invited, but the public is not.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nRead more headlines related to science and technology here\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSchumer, D-N.Y., who's leading the forum with Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, won't necessarily take the tech executives' advice as he works with Republicans and fellow Democrats to try and ensure some oversight of the burgeoning sector. But he's hoping that they will give senators some realistic direction as he tries to do what Congress hasn't done for many years -- pass meaningful regulation of the tech industry.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's going to be a fascinating group because they have different points of view,\" Schumer said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the forum. \"Hopefully we can weave it into a little bit of some broad consensus.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRounds, who spoke to AP with Schumer on Tuesday, said Congress needs to get ahead of fast-moving AI by making sure it continues to develop \"on the positive side\" while also taking care of potential issues surrounding data transparency and privacy.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"AI is not going away, and it can do some really good things or it can be a real challenge,\" Rounds said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSchumer says regulation of artificial intelligence will be \"one of the most difficult issues we can ever take on,\" and ticks off the reasons why: It's technically complicated, it keeps changing and it \"has such a wide, broad effect across the whole world,\" he said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCongress has a lacklustre track record when it comes to regulating technology. Lawmakers have lots of proposals -- many of them bipartisan -- but have mostly failed to agree on major legislation to regulate the industry as powerful tech companies have resisted.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMany lawmakers point to the failure to pass any legislation surrounding social media -- bills have stalled in both chambers that would better protect children, regulate activity around elections and mandate stricter privacy standards, among other measures.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We don't want to do what we did with social media, which is let the techies figure it out, and we'll fix it later,\" says Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., on the AI push.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSchumer's bipartisan working group -- comprised of Rounds, Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana -- is hoping that the rapid growth of artificial intelligence will create more urgency. Sparked by the release of ChatGPT less than a year ago, businesses across many sectors have been clamouring to apply new generative AI tools that can compose human-like passages of text, program computer code and create novel images, audio and video. The hype over such tools has accelerated worries over its potential societal harms and prompted calls for more transparency in how the data behind the new products is collected and used.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"You have to have some government involvement for guardrails,\" Schumer said. \"If there are no guardrails, who knows what could happen.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSchumer says Wednesday's forum will focus on big ideas like whether the government should be involved at all, and what questions Congress should be asking. Each participant will have three minutes to speak on a topic of their choosing, and Schumer and Rounds will moderate open discussions among the group in the morning and afternoon.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSome of Schumer's most influential guests, including Musk and Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, have signalled more dire concerns evoking popular science fiction about the possibility of humanity losing control to advanced AI systems if the right safeguards are not in place.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut for many lawmakers and the people they represent, AI's effects on employment and navigating a flood of AI-generated misinformation are more immediate effects.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA recent report from the market research group Forrester projected that generative AI technology could replace 2.4 million jobs in the U.S. by 2030, many of them white-collar roles not affected by previous waves of automation. This year alone the number of lost jobs could total 90,000, the report said, though far more jobs will be reshaped than eliminated.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAI experts have also warned of the growing potential of AI-generated online disinformation to influence elections, including the upcoming 2024 presidential race.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn the more positive side, Rounds says he would like to see the empowerment of new medical technologies that could save lives and allow medical professionals to access more data. That topic is \"very personal to me,\" Rounds says, after his wife died of cancer two years ago.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMany members of Congress agree that legislation will probably be needed in response to the quick escalation of artificial intelligence tools in government, business and daily life. But there is little consensus on what that should be, or what might be needed. There is also some division -- some members worry more about overregulation, and others worry more about the potential risks of an unchecked industry.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I am involved in this process in large measure to ensure that we act, but we don't act more boldly or over-broadly than the circumstances require,\" says Sen. Young, one of the members of Schumer's working group. \"We should be skeptical of government, which is why I think it's important that you got Republicans at the table.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tYoung says that Schumer has reassured him that he will be \"hypersensitive to overshooting as we address some of the potential harms of AI.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSome Republicans have been wary of following the path of the European Union, which signed off in June on the world's first set of comprehensive rules for artificial intelligence. The EU's AI Act will govern any product or service that uses an AI system and classify them according to four levels of risk, from minimal to unacceptable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA group of corporations has called on EU leaders to rethink the rules, arguing that it could make it harder for companies in the 27-nation bloc to compete with rivals overseas in the use of generative AI.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn the United States, most major tech companies have expressed support for AI regulations, though they don't necessarily agree on what that means.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We've always said that we think that AI should get regulated,\" said Dana Rao, general counsel and chief trust officer for software company Adobe. \"We've talked to Europe about this for the last four years, helping them think through the AI Act they're about to pass. There are high-risk use cases for AI that we think the government has a role to play in order to make sure they're safe for the public and the consumer.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAdobe, which makes Photoshop and the new AI image-generator Firefly, is proposing its own federal legislation: an \"anti-impersonation\" bill to protect artists as well as AI developers from the misuse of generative AI tools to produce derivative works without a creator's consent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSenators say they will figure out a way to regulate the industry, despite the odds.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Make no mistake. There will be regulation. The only question is how soon, and what,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., at a Tuesday hearing on legislation he wrote with Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBlumenthal's framework calls for a new \"licensing regime\" that would require tech companies to seek licenses for high-risk AI systems.

Here's how to combat the post-summer blues", "summary": "", "content": "\n     \n    \n\r\n\tSummer holidays are officially coming to an end, with a new school year just a calendar flip away. For some children and teenagers, this can be a daunting time, as feelings of post-summer sadness and back-to-school anxiety loom.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhile a new school year can always be nerve-wracking, data suggests there's been a significant jump in youth struggling with anxiety – from 11.6 per cent of youth experiencing a form of anxiety in 2012, to 20.5 per cent of youth in 2021, according to a meta-analysis of 29 different studies by the Journal of the American Medical Association's \npediatrics research.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA Canadian registered psychologist told CTVNews.ca that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is part of this, and is still being felt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“We know the pandemic impacted youth in terms of academic learning and milestones, social isolation and development as well as ongoing family stress,” said Marlene Taube-Schiff, director and founder of Forward Thinking Psychological Services, a multidisciplinary practice offering services in Ontario and B.C., in email to CTVNews.ca.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“It can take time for youth to recover from these ongoing stressors. In addition, youth and teens can face challenges with emotion regulation, social development, peer pressure and academic stressors. Altogether, this can amount to mental health issues, including anxiety and low mood.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSIGNS OF ANXIETY IN YOUNG PEOPLE\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnxiety can show up differently in everyone.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor those with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), it often involves a persistent feeling of anxiety or dread, which can interfere with daily life. GAD is not the same as anxiety due to stressful life events, however.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor some people, the latter type of anxiety could look like increased irritability, frustration or difficulty sleeping, according to Megan Rafuse, psychotherapist and co-founder and CEO of Shift Collab, an online mental health practice.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOther \nsymptoms of anxiety\n may include feeling restless, wound-up or on edge, feeling easily fatigued, or having difficulty concentrating.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor younger kids, complaints about stomach aches, increased clinginess or expressed worries are signs to look out for.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe transition of the back-to-school time of year can be filled with all kinds of anxiety-inducing uncertainty: adjusting to new teachers, learning new routes to class and re-socializing with peers, to name a few.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“These uncertainties and fears over what to expect for the year ahead can lead to increased feelings of anxiety and result in a whole lot of unhelpful 'what if’-type thoughts,” said Rafuse. “What if my teacher doesn’t like me? What if I don’t fit in? What if I fail? Combined with the physical symptoms of anxiety, these thoughts can be highly distressing.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“While experiencing some anxiety is a normal human experience, if you notice your child really struggling, it’s important to talk to them about what they are feeling,” said Rafuse.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\n5 Things to Know newsletter: Sign up to start your day with the biggest stories\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHOW TO NAVIGATE PRE-SCHOOL ANXIETY\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor some, the end of summer vacation may mean saying goodbye to friends, family or activities that bring joy, as well as the escape the months of brings from the stress of the school year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Summertime is often marked by freedom from structure and schedules, academic pressures and possibly peer challenges, which might include bullying. There is a significant change in routine over summer. And while this is often a welcome change, it can be very difficult to go back to the rigid nature of school,” said Taube-Schiff.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe suggests youth take stock of what they are most worried about and take action to relieve some of those fears.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“If you are starting a new school and don’t know many people, try connecting with anyone you know who might be going there. Even if they are not a close friend, they are a familiar face and that will help you greatly on that first day,” said Taube-Schiff.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe added that re-establishing connections with friends that students may not have seen over the summer may help with the first-day jitters.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOther tips include eating well, getting physical activity and even saying coping statements to manage anxiety.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor example, stating “I have done this before,” could be helpful, said Taube-Schiff. “Writing down some helpful coping statements and putting them in your room can be a great reminder when you find your anxiety is starting to rise.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf it’s returning to the building itself that is instilling so anxiety, she suggests visiting the school beforehand as a form of exposure to the fear.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMeanwhile, Rafuse recommends kids and teens take time to reflect on what they did in the summer with gratitude, and consider how they could implement these same activities into their school year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOne example may be playing recreational sports after class, for those who enjoyed an active couple of months off.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn fact, \nsome studies\n have shown that physical activity can be an effective tool to reduce anxiety in teens. Many community centres run year-round programming for kids and youth at low-cost or subsidized rates.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMore holistically, it’s important to acknowledge the uncomfortable feelings of transition periods, says Rafuse.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“If you find yourself worrying about the unknown, there are a few things you can do. First, remind yourself of what you can control. For example, you can choose your outfits, your lunch or who you choose to spend time with at school during the day,” she said. “You can also use a therapy trick to help you to deal with the big worries by asking yourself, 'What would I say to the person I love the most if they were feeling this way?' Surely, you wouldn’t be telling them that the worst-case scenario is going to happen.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe added that creating a routine ahead of school can help.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“At least a week before the first day of school, start to get back into that school-year routine by getting back into your sleep routine, reducing time on social media, choosing outfits for school, or doing a walk-through with your child about what they can expect on the first day of school.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHOW EDUCATORS AND PARENTS CAN SUPPORT\n\r\n\n\r\n\tEducators or parents and guardians can also take action to support students as they head back to school.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRafuse says they can help by working hard to alleviate as much uncertainty as possible.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Share lots of details about what your child can expect and what the new routine will look like, and allow them to make decisions as part of their school experience and give them a sense of ownership over preparing for back to school, where possible.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTaube-Schiff suggests teachers address anxiety at the start of the school year in ways such as allowing caregivers to visit the classroom during the first week to check in, as a way of normalizing anxiety and showing support. Similarly, she added that offering drop-in hours at the start of the school year, when these feelings may be heightened, can be helpful.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFor young students, a more hands-on approach can be taken - such as learning how to do mindful breathing or journaling within the classroom.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“Engaging students in these types of activities can ground them in the present moment and allow them to 'reset' and tolerate their distress and anxiety,'\" Taube-Schiff said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Distress tolerance strategies can also help. This could involve taking breaks from the classroom, splashing cold water on one’s face or being able to run up and down the stairs,” she says.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAnxiety Canada, a science-based anxiety relief organization, has also developed \na free online course that parents can use to teach children about anxiety and coping tools\n.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Flick's team has not won any of its last five games and conceded 13 goals in that time.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"At some point, expectations and reality are so far apart that you have to accept that currently you aren't good enough,\" Germany captain Ilkay Gundo─ƒan told broadcaster RTL. \"Perhaps we also think that we are better than we really are.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFlick said he believes he is still the right coach for Germany and he was supported by Gundo─ƒan, who said he still trusts him. Another challenge comes Tuesday with a friendly against World Cup runner-up France.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tJapan targeted Germany left-back Nico Schlotterbeck from the off. A low cross in the 12th minute allowed Junya Ito to score with a shot that appeared to take a deflection off Antonio Rudiger.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGermany responded when Florian Wirtz found Leroy Sane in space to score, but conceded again almost immediately when Ayase Ueda finished off another move involving a cross from the right.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tFlick tried to shake things up in the second half, introducing Brighton midfielder Pascal Gross on debut and giving Thomas Muller a game for the first time since the World Cup.

Musk had refused due to concerns that Russia would launch a nuclear attack in response. Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and claims it as its territory.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nComplete coverage of the war in Ukraine\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nIf you're on Telegram, subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on top stories\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMusk was not on a military contract when he refused the Crimea request; he'd been providing terminals to Ukraine for free in response to Russia's February 2022 invasion. However, in the months since, the U.S. military has funded and officially contracted with Starlink for continued support. The Pentagon has not disclosed the terms or cost of that contract, citing operational security.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut the Pentagon is reliant on SpaceX for far more than the Ukraine response, and the uncertainty that Musk or any other commercial vendor could refuse to provide services in a future conflict has led space systems military planners to reconsider what needs to be explicitly laid out in future agreements, Kendall said during a roundtable with reporters at the Air Force Association convention at National Harbor, Maryland, on Monday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"If we're going to rely upon commercial architectures or commercial systems for operational use, then we have to have some assurances that they're going to be available,\" Kendall said. \"We have to have that. Otherwise they are a convenience and maybe an economy in peacetime, but they're not something we can rely upon in wartime.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpaceX also has the contract to help the Air Force's Air Mobility Command develop a rocket ship that would quickly move military cargo into a conflict zone or disaster zone, which could alleviate the military's reliance on slower aircraft or ships. While not specifying SpaceX, Gen. Mike Minihan, head of Air Mobility Command, said, \"American industry has to be clear-eyed on the full spectrum of what it could be used for.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs U.S. military investment in space has increased in recent years, concerns have revolved around how to indemnify commercial vendors from liability in case something goes wrong in a launch and whether the U.S. military has an obligation to defend those firms' assets, such as their satellites or ground stations, if they are providing military support in a conflict.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUntil Musk's refusal in Ukraine, there had not been a focus on whether there needed to be language saying a firm providing military support in war had to agree that that support could be used in combat.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We acquire technology, we acquire services, required platforms to serve the Air Force mission, or in this case, the Department of the Air Force,\" said Andrew Hunter, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics. \"So that is an expectation, that it is going to be used for Air Force purposes, which will include, when necessary, to be used to support combat operations.\"\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Margaret Court also collected a total of 24, but 13 of those came before professionals were admitted to the Slam events.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThere were moments, particularly in the 1-hour, 44-minute second set that was as much about tenacity as talent, when Djokovic appeared to be faltering. After some of the most grueling points -- and there were many -- he would lean over with hands on knees or use his racket for support or pause to stretch his legs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThis triumph against Medvedev, the opponent who beat him in the 2021 final at Flushing Meadows to stop a bid for the first men's calendar-year Grand Slam in more than a half-century, made Djokovic the oldest male champion at the U.S. Open in the Open era.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"First of all, Novak, I want to ask: What are you still doing here?\" Medvedev joked during the trophy presentation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDjokovic's fourth championship in New York, where he was unable to compete a year ago because he isn't vaccinated against COVID-19, goes alongside his 10 trophies from the Australian Open, seven from Wimbledon and three from the French Open, extending his lead on the men's Slam list. Rafael Nadal, who has been sidelined since January with a hip problem that required surgery, is next with 22; Roger Federer, who announced his retirement a year ago, finished with 20.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWhen it was over, Medvedev tapped Djokovic on the chest as they chatted at the net. Djokovic flung his racket away, put his arms up and then knelt on the court, with his head bowed. And then the celebration was on. First he found his daughter for a hug. His son and wife came next, along with his team.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSoon, Djokovic was donning a shirt with \"24\" and \"Mamba Forever\" written on it as a tribute to the late NBA star Kobe Bryant, who wore that jersey number. And on top of that went a white jacket with the same significant number stamped on the chest.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAs good as ever, Djokovic went 27-1 in the sport's most prestigious events this season: The lone blemish was a loss to Carlos Alcaraz in the final at Wimbledon in July. Djokovic will rise to No. 1 in the rankings on Monday, overtaking Alcaraz, who was the defending champion at Flushing Meadows but was eliminated by No. 3 Medvedev.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAt the start Sunday, with the Arthur Ashe Stadium retractable roof shut because of rain in the forecast, Djokovic was comfortable as can be. No sign of the occasion weighing on him, no trace of the tension he acknowledged briefly arose late in his semifinal against unseeded American Ben Shelton.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHis exemplary movement good as ever, every stroke just so, Djokovic came out as his best self. He grabbed 12 of the first 16 points - three via aces perfectly placed, and with pace, and four via exchanges that lasted 10 strokes or more - along the way to leads of 3-0 and 4-1.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMedvedev, in contrast, seemed tight, jittery, the looping swings of his white racket breaking down repeatedly, whether on a trio of double-faults in the opening set or during the lengthier points, other than on one 37-shot back-and-forth that ended when Djokovic blinked, stumbling as he flubbed a backhand.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBeyond that, though, Djokovic was as reliable as a metronome, anticipating nearly everything headed his way and scurrying this way and that to retrieve and respond, as is his wont.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Saleh said Rodgers will have season-ending surgery, but he wasn't certain when that would occur.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tTorn Achilles tendons typically take several months of recovery due to the extensive rehabilitation needed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop sports headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\tOn his fourth regular-season snap in a Jets uniform, Rodgers tried to avoid a rushing Leonard Floyd, who wrapped up the quarterback and spun him down to the MetLife Stadium turf. Rodgers stood up after a few moments, looked over to the Jets' sideline and then sat on the turf -- seemingly knowing he was seriously hurt.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe needed help from trainers to get to New York's sideline, where he was taken to the blue medical tent to be examined. Rodgers then got on a cart to go to the locker room, hopped off near the tunnel and limped inside.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tZach Wilson replaced Rodgers just 3:45 into the game and finished 14 of 21 for 140 yards with a touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson and an interception in the victory.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe third-year quarterback will now start for the Jets on Sunday at Dallas -- and the foreseeable future.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"This is Zach's team and we're rolling with Zach,\" Saleh said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWilson praised the work Rodgers did with him during the offseason and training camp, helping him feel \"a lot more prepared\" to take the next step in his development.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The hardest part is now putting it into a game and I've got to be able to do that,\" Wilson said Monday night. \"Going into this week, it's applying everything that he's kind of helped walk us through and being able to watch him and the coaches, how they've handled this offense. I've got to be able to handle that efficiently.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRodgers, who spent his first 18 seasons with Green Bay, was acquired by the Jets in April and immediately raised expectations for the frustrated franchise.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe gave the Jets their most accomplished quarterback since Brett Favre, who was acquired from Green Bay in 2008 -- clearing the way for Rodgers to become the Packers' signal caller.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRodgers, who repeatedly has said he won't be one-and-done with the Jets, agreed in July to a restructured contract that gives him $75 million in fully guaranteed money over this season and next.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut now, he'll have to focus on a lengthy recovery and rehabilitation process, which could make his playing future uncertain.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe situation evoked eerily similar memories of 1999, when Vinny Testaverde -- who, coincidentally, was the Jets' honorary captain Monday night -- ruptured his Achilles tendon early in New York's season opener against New England.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLike this year's squad, those Jets had Super Bowl aspirations after going to the AFC championship game the previous season. New York instead finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tWith Rodgers likely out for the season, New York will not give up a first-round draft pick to Green Bay next year as part of the trade's terms. It will remain a second-round pick that could have become a first-rounder if Rodgers had played 65 per cent of the Jets' plays this season.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe Packers also received the 13th overall pick, a second-rounder and a sixth-rounder in this year's draft in exchange for Rodgers, the No. 15 overall pick and a fifth-rounder this year.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

It should also clear the way for Spain to get back on track with its bid to host the men's World Cup in 2030 along with Portugal, Morocco and possibly Ukraine.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"It's over,\" Irene Montero, the acting minister of equality in Spain, wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRubiales had been widely criticized after he kissed Jenni Hermoso on the lips during the awards ceremony following Spain's 1-0 win over England in the Women's World Cup final on Aug. 20 in Sydney. Hermoso said the kiss was without her consent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRubiales had been expected to resign at an emergency general meeting of the federation shortly after the World Cup final, but instead said he was victim of a \"witch hunt\" by \"false feminists.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHis defiant stand did not make the problem go away.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"The feminist country is advancing faster and faster,\" Yolanda Diaz, Spain's acting Deputy Prime Minister, wrote on X after Rubiales made his resignation public. \"The transformation and improvement of our lives is inevitable. We are with you, Jenni, and with all women.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpain's National Court announced Monday it has agreed to a request from prosecutors to look into whether Rubiales should face charges of sexual assault and coercion. That means the court will gather evidence in the case, likely including asking Rubiales to testify before deciding whether it can go ahead.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to a sexual consent law passed last year, Rubiales could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty of sexual assault. The new law eliminated the difference between \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual assault,\" sanctioning any unconsented sexual act.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRubiales had been without public supporters other than his mother, who held a short-lived hunger strike in a church in southern Spain. His own federation also publicly asked him to step down and one of his biggest supporters, women's team coach Jorge Vilda, was fired last week.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPedro Rocha has been in charge of the federation since Rubiales was provisionally suspended by FIFA, the governing body of world soccer. The Spanish federation said in a statement early Monday that it would start proceedings to call for a new presidential election.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tRubiales also said he has resigned as a vice president of European soccer body UEFA because of the reputational danger the scandal could inflict on Spain's joint bid to host the men's World Cup.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"I don't want Spanish soccer to be hurt by this exaggerated campaign against me, and above all, I take this decision after being assured that my exit would help contribute to the stability that will allow both Europe and Africa to stay united for their dream of 2030, which will permit the greatest sporting event in the world to go to our country,\" Rubiales said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Insisting in waiting and hanging on would not contribute anything positive (for) either the federation or Spanish soccer, among other reasons, because the powers that be would stop me from returning (to my job).\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe next men's World Cup will be played in the United States, Mexico and Canada in 2026.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe statement from Rubiales late Sunday came at about the same time as the release of clips of an interview he did with TV host Piers Morgan on Britain's TalkTV.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpanish state prosecutors last week opened the door for Rubiales to face criminal charges, which he still will have to deal with despite resigning from the soccer federation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"What I hope is that he goes away through a conviction, a sentencing, not because of his voluntary decision,\" Victoria Rosell, a government official dealing with gender violence, was quoted as saying by Spain's EFE news agency.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tSpain, which has moved up to No. 2 in the FIFA rankings, is scheduled to start the Women's Nations League on Sept. 22 with a visit to top-ranked Sweden.

The AI-generated label remains regardless of modifications like added filters or altered colours.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe SynthID tool can also scan incoming images and identify the likelihood they were made by Imagen by scanning for the watermark with three levels of certainty: detected, not detected and possibly detected.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\nTop science and technology headlines, all in one place\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"While this technology isn't perfect, our internal testing shows that it's accurate against many common image manipulations,\" wrote Google in a blog post Tuesday.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA beta version of SynthID is now available to some customers of Vertex AI, Google's generative-AI platform for developers.

They don't look amateur, they don't have spelling errors or grammatical problems,\" he said.\n \n \nCybersecurity expert Chester Wisniewski says Canadians need to be more aware of sophisticated phishing emails becoming more increasingly convincing and frequent. Photo credit to Sophos X-Ops.\n \n Those behind phishing and spear phishing scams either pretend to be a generic, known business or organization, or they act as a targeted business that an individual has current ties to; like the banking institution they use on a daily basis. According to the \nCanadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC)\n, 9,000 phishing and spear phishing scams were reported to the CAFC in 2021, amassing $54 million in victim losses.\n \n Wisniewski says these scams have evolved from small groups of criminals to entire networks where criminals can buy and sell their services to send and create these fake emails. He explains a job in this marketplace could look like a personal being hired to create a bank's logo and write the email in the main language of the country being targeted. It could also involve hiring a person to rent out a computer, which is then used to send out phishing scams to the most victims as possible.\n \n \"The people that do each job in the criminal ecosystem have got very, very good at it and that's increasing the success rate of the criminals being able to steal larger amounts of money,\" he said.\n \n STAYING PROTECTED, ESPECIALLY AMID CORPORATE HACKS\n \n \nThe CRA details on its website\n it will never demand immediate payment or send a link with your refund amount online, and it will only contact individuals to notify them of a new message, followed by directions to go to their CRA portal.\n \n Wisniewski says because the CRA will only approach individuals online for message notifications, it can be easier to detect fraudulent activity from scammers pretending to be the CRA. However, he says, he's concerned with emails from scammers pretending to be banking institutions or targeted businesses, especially after recent cybersecurity attacks.\n \n \nIndigo\n was recently affected by a cyberattack that impacted the bookstore chain's website and electronic payment system. While it's still unknown if customer data was impacted, Wisniewski explains similar cyberattacks that gain access to customers' personal data could make email scams more believable.\n \n \nCybersecurity expert Chester Wisniewski says Canadians need to be more aware of sophisticated phishing emails becoming more increasingly convincing and frequent. Photo credit to Sophos X-Ops.\n \n \"We do see them impersonate name brands after these big hacks, where they now know all these people have a Marriott Rewards number or they know that people have an Indigo account,\" he said.\n \n \"As a result, this lends more credibility to something you're used to interacting with.\"\n \n Ultimately, Canadians need to be on alert for suspicious and unsolicited \nemails, texts and phone calls\n as scammers get a head start on tax season, Wisniewski said.\n \n He recommends not clicking any links for payments you're not expecting, or if you're being sent an email from the CRA, go directly to your CRA account, rather than clicking any links, to see if the message is in fact authentic.\n \n \"I would expect that we will not only continue to see them, we'll likely see more of them, in more frequency, as we get closer to tax day,\" he said. \n \n Canadians can file their 2022 taxes starting Feb. 20, 2023 and the deadline for most Canadians is April 30, 2023. \n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

More than 2,000 people were killed, and the toll was expected to rise as rescuers struggled Saturday to reach hard-hit remote areas.\n \n  \n \nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n \n \n The magnitude 6.8 quake, the biggest to hit the North African country in 120 years, sent people fleeing their homes in terror and disbelief late Friday. One man said dishes and wall hangings began raining down, and people were knocked off their feet. The quake brought down walls made from stone and masonry, covering whole communities with rubble.\n \n The devastation gripped each town along the High Atlas' steep and winding switchbacks in similar ways: homes folding in on themselves and mothers and fathers crying as boys and helmet-clad police carried the dead through the streets.\n \n \nPeople drive past a damaged wall of the historic Medina of Marrakech, after after an earthquake in Morocco, Saturday, Sept. 9, 2023.

(AP Photo/Mosa'ab Elshamy)\n \n Remote villages like those in the drought-stricken Ouargane Valley were largely cut off from the world when they lost electricity and cellphone service. By midday, people were outside mourning neighbours, surveying the damage on their camera phones and telling one another \"May God save us.\"\n \n Hamid Idsalah, a 72-year-old mountain guide, said he and many others remained alive but had little future to look forward to. That was true in the short-term -- with remnants of his kitchen reduced to dust -- and in the long-term -- where he and many others lack the financial means to rebound.\n \n \"I can't reconstruct my home. I don't know what I'll do. Still, I'm alive, so I'll wait,\" he said as he walked through the desert oasis town overlooking red rock hills, packs of goats and a glistening salt lake. \"I feel heartsick.\"\n \n In historic Marrakech, people could be seen on state TV clustering in the streets , afraid to go back inside buildings that might still be unstable. The city's famous Koutoubia Mosque, built in the 12th century, was damaged, but the extent was not immediately clear. Its 69-metre (226-foot) minaret is known as the \"roof of Marrakech.\" Moroccans also posted videos showing damage to parts of the famous red walls that surround the old city, a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n \n At least 2,012 people died in the quake, mostly in Marrakech and five provinces near the epicentre, Morocco's Interior Ministry reported Saturday night. At least 2,059 more people were injured -- 1,404 critically -- the ministry said.\n \n \"The problem is that where destructive earthquakes are rare, buildings are simply not constructed robustly enough to cope with strong ground shaking, so many collapse, resulting in high casualties,\" said Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London.\n \n In a sign of the huge scale of the disaster, Morocco's King Mohammed VI ordered the armed forces to mobilize specialized search and rescue teams and a surgical field hospital, according to a statement from the military.\n \n The king said he would visit the hardest hit area Saturday, but despite an outpouring of offers of help from around the world, the Moroccan government had not formally asked for assistance, a step required before outside rescue crews could deploy.\n \n \nPeople take shelter after an earthquake in Marrakech, Morocco, Friday, Sept. 8, 2023.

Al Haouz is known for scenic villages and valleys tucked in the High Atlas Mountains.\n \n Police, emergency vehicles and people fleeing in shared taxis spent hours traversing unpaved roads through the High Atlas in stop-and-go traffic, often exiting their cars to help clear giant boulders from routes known to be rugged and difficult long before Friday's earthquake. In Ijjoukak, a village in the area surrounding Toubkal, North Africa's tallest peak, residents estimated nearly 200 buildings had been levelled.\n \n Couch cushions, electric cords and grapes were strewn in giant piles of rubble alongside dead sheep, houseplants and doors wedged between boulders. Relatives from the town and those who had driven from major cities cried while they wondered who to call as they reckoned with the aftermath and a lack of food and water.\n \n \"It felt like a bomb went off,\" 34-year-old Mohamed Messi said.\n \n Morocco will observe three days of national mourning with flags at half-staff on all public facilities, the official news agency MAP reported.\n \n World leaders offered to send in aid or rescue crews as condolences poured in from countries in Europe, the Middle East and the Group of 20 summit in India. The president of Turkey, which lost tens of thousands of people in a massive earthquake earlier this year, was among those proposing assistance. France and Germany, with large populations of people of Moroccan origin, also offered to help, and the leaders of both Ukraine and Russia expressed support for Moroccans.\n \n In an exceptional move, neighbouring rival Algeria offered to open its airspace to allow eventual humanitarian aid or medical evacuation flights to travel to and from Morocco. Algeria closed the airspace when its government severed diplomatic ties with Morocco in 2021 over a series of issues. The countries have a decadeslong dispute involving the territory of Western Sahara.\n \n The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.8 when it hit at 11:11 p.m. (22:11 GMT), with shaking that lasted several seconds. The U.S. agency reported a magnitude 4.9 aftershock hit 19 minutes later. The collision of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates occurred at a relatively shallow depth, which makes a quake more dangerous.\n \n Earthquakes are relatively rare in North Africa. Lahcen Mhanni, Head of the Seismic Monitoring and Warning Department at the National Institute of Geophysics, told 2M TV that the earthquake was the strongest ever recorded in the region.\n \n In 1960, a magnitude 5.8 tremor struck near the Moroccan city of Agadir and caused thousands of deaths. That quake prompted changes in construction rules in Morocco, but many buildings, especially rural homes, are not built to withstand such tremors.\n \n In 2004, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake near the Mediterranean coastal city of Al Hoceima left more than 600 dead.\n \n Friday's quake was felt as far away as Portugal and Algeria, according to the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere and Algeria's Civil Defence agency, which oversees emergency response.\n \n ------\n \n \nAssociated Press writers Angela Charlton in Paris, Ahmed Hatem in Cairo, and Brian Melley and Hadia Bakkar in London contributed to this report.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Prosecutors said he didn't stop until his girlfriend, former WNBA player Kysre Gondrezick, ran out into the hallway covered in blood.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe NBA star, who had been in police custody since his arrest around 6:45 a.m. Monday, was released after posting bail, which was set at US$75,000 cash or US$100,000 bond.

Porter claimed he didn't know the gun was there, and his charges were eventually dismissed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPorter, a 2019 first-round draft pick from the University of Southern California, was traded from Cleveland to Houston a few months later after he reportedly blew up at the Cavaliers' general manager after finding out that his locker had been moved to make room for a newly acquired player.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn April 2021, the NBA fined Porter US$50,000 for violating the league's COVID-19 health and safety rules by visiting a Miami strip club.

The CRA says this is to ensure that My Account users can get notified when important changes are made to their account.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAdding an email address on file won't affect how you get your notices of assessment (NOA) and other correspondence from the CRA, unless you set your correspondence preference to \"electronic mail.\" Otherwise, you can still choose to get paper NOAs by mail, if you prefer.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf you've signed up to receive CRA mail electronically, be sure to regularly check your junk or spam folders to ensure that you don't miss any important information. Better yet, adding do_not_reply-ne_pas_repondre@cra-arc.gc.ca to your safe senders list will ensure the CRA's emails will arrive in your inbox.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nMulti-factor authentication\n, also called two-factor authentication, is a tool that offers a second security check on your account after you've entered your username and password.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe CRA had been rolling out multi-factor authentication to My Account users since 2020. Previously, multi-factor authentication had been an optional feature. But sometime in fall of 2021, the CRA updated its website to indicate that multi-factor authentication is \"mandatory for all users who wish to use the CRA sign-in services.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf you've never enabled multi-factor authentication on your CRA account, the website will prompt you to enroll after logging into My Account. You'll have the choice of using a telephone or a passcode grid.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf you choose the telephone option, you'll be prompted to enter a cell or a landline number. Now, when you log into My Account, the CRA will send a one-time passcode through a text message or an automated phone call. Enter the one-time passcode and you'll be logged in.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf you don't have a phone, you can also choose to \nuse a passcode grid\n for multi-factor authentication. If you enroll with this method, you'll be given a grid of numbered rows and lettered columns, similar to a bingo card, that you can print or save. Each time you log into My Account, the CRA will ask for three letter and number combinations on your grid to be used as your one-time passcode.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tA NEW LOOK FOR MY ACCOUNT\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe CRA has rolled out \nMy Account Beta\n, introducing a new user interface for the online service. If you'd like to give the beta a try, sign into My Account and click \"Try the new My Account BETA.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tYou can switch back to the full version of My Account at any time. If you choose to use the new interface, be aware that some services, such as COVID-19 benefits, may not yet be available on the beta website.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBE AWARE OF SCAMS\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt's important to be vigilant of fraudulent emails, text messages and phone calls from scammers masquerading as CRA agents. The CRA has a \nlist of guidelines on its website\n to make it easy for you to identify a fraudulent communication.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIf you've received something that appears to be from the CRA, you can call the CRA to confirm whether or not the communication was genuine. You can also check your mailbox on the My Account portal, which will also have all official correspondences from the CRA.\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}}
