His parole was extended by another six months in July.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the terms of his release, he was required to return to the facility every night, abstain from alcohol and report all sexual and non-sexual relationships with women.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHe was also ordered not to go to Saskatchewan without permission and not to contact Paskemin's family.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe board's decision noted MacKay's case management team in prison was not supportive of day parole because he was a high risk for violent reoffending and required a more gradual release plan.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There continue to be concerns regarding power and control issues and possible issues with women,\" the document said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tAccording to the law, an offender's parole may be suspended if they breach a condition of their release or if a member of the parole board believes it is necessary to prevent a breach or to protect society.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tVictoria police spokesperson Const. Terri Healy told CTV News the department was asked by correctional officials to arrest MacKay.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tLisa Saether, a regional manager with the parole board, said she could not discuss the specifics of the case. She said Correctional Service Canada is responsible for the supervision and custody of offenders in the institution and on parole.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"If an offender on parole fails to abide by conditions imposed, their release may be suspended by CSC and they will be returned to prison,\" Saether said in an email to CTV News.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMURDER OF PASKEMIN\n\r\n\n\r\n\tDuring his murder trial, the court heard that MacKay met Paskemin at a country bar in Saskatoon. He offered the young Indigenous woman a ride home, but instead brought her to an isolated road on the outskirts of the city.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tParole documents said he sexually assaulted Paskemin violently in his truck. When she managed to escape, he hit her with such force that he broke her jaw and knocked out a tooth.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMacKay drove his truck over Paskemin's head before using a chain to drag her naked remains into a ditch. Her body was also set on fire.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMacKay was arrested less than a week later after a driver reported seeing blood on the road. Paskemin's DNA was found throughout MacKay's vehicle, on his belt buckle and on the chain.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt took weeks for her body to be discovered by motorists driving by the area.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMacKay said at trial that the killing was an accident and denied any sexual component to the slaying. Parole documents showed that MacKay had only recently admitted culpability in her death.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe board said MacKay had a \"flat affect\" throughout the hearing and \"appeared to show no emotion\" while talking about the killing and harms he caused.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"There remain concerns that you have minimized your actions against the victim,\" the parole board's decision said.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe board noted he has received three institutional charges while incarcerated, twice for possession of unauthorized items and once for delaying a prisoner count.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt also noted that MacKay sent a letter to a staff member that appeared to cross boundaries. He also asked a family member to contact that staff member so he could keep in touch.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tHowever, the parole board ultimately found MacKay \"will not present an undue risk to society if released on day parole\" and the move would help him reintegrate into society.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tGROUP CALLS FOR RESIGNATION OF PAROLE BOARD\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIn a statement Wednesday, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations called for the resignation of the Parole Board of Canada over MacKay's release and subsequent arrest.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"Killers who inflict such devastating harm on First Nations women are unfit to be part of society,\" reads the statement. \"Killer Kenneth MacKay has violated the basic principles of human dignity and justice, and he has forfeited his right to belong to a civilized community.\"\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe federation, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, accused the parole board of failing to protect the public and uphold justice and reconciliation with MacKay's release.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tPaskemin was from the Sweetgrass First Nation and her family said in February that she had a contagious smile and magnetic character. They started Crystal's Gift, a non-profit that rehomes gently used furniture to single mothers fleeing violence, in her name.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tShe had four younger sisters, all under 19 when she was killed.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\"We pray that no family must go through the hell-on-earth that we have had to navigate, through the darkest depths of evil, at the hands of this murderer,\" the family said in a prepared statement.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t\nWith files from The Canadian Press\n\r\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Young children are considered high-risk of developing a serious condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) up to 10 days after symptoms begin.\n \n \"The kidney is the most commonly affected organ but it can affect almost any organ in the body, including the brain, the heart, the liver, the pancreas,\" Freedman said.\n \n \"So until the last child exposed is out of the at-risk window, which is about 10 days after the onset of their symptoms, then we will continue to worry that we will see children who have seen significant disease.\"\n \n Nine patients have confirmed cases of HUS.\n \n AHS said Thursday all of the patients are stable and receiving care in hospital.\n \n Some children are spending several hours a day at the hospital, getting blood tests to monitor for HUS.\n \n \"Children can really deteriorate acutely. They can go from looking quite well and having a really quite normal biochemical bloodwork profile to, you know, requiring dialysis within 24 hours,\" Freedman said.\n \n A family member of a three-year-old E. coli patient says the severity of the situation is not being communicated.\n \n He says while parents have been complaining about not having a daycare, he has watched a previously perfectly healthy three-year-old suffering in hospital.\n \n It started Saturday, when they noticed blood in the child's stool, and he was suffering from severe stomach cramps.\n \n They took him to the Alberta Children's Hospital, where he was admitted and they were told it was good to catch it early.\n \n Over 24 hours, things went from bad to worse.\n \n They were told the child had the worst form of E. coli but hadn't developed HUS.\n \n Six hours later, they were told he in fact does have it.\n \n He underwent surgery on Wednesday and was then put on dialysis.\n \n Doctors say they are monitoring his situation.\n \n The scariest part for the family is they were told it's not clear how this might impact his other organs.\n \n The child has labour-level stomach cramps every three to five minutes, as well as bruises from all the blood they've taken from him.\n \n \"It's just hell,\" the family member said.\n \n \"Hemolytic uremic syndrome can potentially be a life-altering, deadly complication,\" said Bill Marler, a renowned American food safety lawyer.\n \n Marler has been contacted by Calgary families with children infected by the daycare E. coli outbreak, and a Canadian lawyer.\n \n Though he cannot practice in Canada, he can provide consultation.\n \n \"I would not be surprised that you saw a class-action lawsuit filed immediately,\" he said.\n \n \"These kinds of outbreaks, where you have literally hundreds of people sick from consuming food, you know, don't happen without some high degree of negligence.\"\n \n Of the 25 patients in hospital, 20 are at the Alberta Children's Hospital and five are at the Peter Lougheed Centre.\n \n \n \n Thursday evening, AHS released the following statement to CTV Calgary:\n \n \"To ensure the safety of our patients, families and care teams, a limit of two designated visitors are permitted to visit inpatients receiving care for E. coli at Alberta Children’s Hospital at this time. One caregiver is permitted to attend an appointment with a child receiving outpatient care.\n \n \"This visitor restriction is in place to reduce any potential risk of spread of infection to our patients, families and staff.\n \n \"Other means of communication with inpatients other than in-person visits include phone, or FaceTime.\n \n \"We appreciate everyone’s understanding and patience as we work to care for the patients and families that need our care.\"\n \n Freedman says approximately 50 to 60 per cent of children who develop the hemolytic uremic syndrome will need dialysis for a short period of time.\n \n Freedman says most of those children will recover kidney function and will not require chronic dialysis but could be at risk of complications as they get older.\n \n \"This group of children will be predisposed to having chronic kidney disease,\" he said.\n \n AHS says most people who get sick from E. coli improve on their own within 10 days.\n \n \"Antibiotics are not recommended and in fact have a risk of increasing the risk of children developing the hemolytic uremic syndrome,\" Freedman said.\n \n \"We have no other specific treatment for this disease at the moment aside from really preventing dehydration.\"\n \n The source of the outbreak is still under investigation.\n \n Many parents wonder if the contamination may have been in meatloaf served for lunch on Tuesday of last week.\n \n Public health inspectors have collected and are testing food samples from Fueling Minds, the central kitchen used by all the daycares.\n \n A main focus now is preventing secondary cases, which can be spread when bacteria is shed in stool.\n \n \"Obviously, meticulous attention to hand hygiene is of paramount importance to reduce the risk of transmission, which is estimated to occur in about 10 per cent of households,\" Freedman said.\n \n Secondary cases can be just as serious.\n \n Marler represented families affected by a deadly E. coli outbreak at U.S. Jack in the Box restaurants in 1993, including one of the children who died.\n \n \"That child was a secondary case,\" Marler said.\n \n The American lawyer, who was in Banff in June 2023 speaking at the 11th VTEC Symposium on Shiga Toxin Producing Escherichia coli Infections, says this may be the largest reported E. coli outbreak connected with a daycare.\n \n \"I'm not aware of any daycare case that I've ever heard of, where you have over 100 people sick,\" he said.\n \n Not all the 11 Calgary-area daycares have confirmed cases, but six Fueling Brains Academy locations in Calgary and five other sites will remain closed until the issue is resolved.\n \n AHS has launched a central website with information for parents of kids at these daycares.\n \n Alberta Children's Hospital has set up a dedicated clinic to monitor symptomatic patients after their initial emergency room visit.\n \n AHS advises families not to take children to hospital if they are not symptomatic.\n \n AHS health inspection reports for Fueling Minds dating back to 2021 show some violations, including dirty food contact surfaces and food not being stored at safe temperatures, but follow-up inspections, most recently in April, show the kitchen in compliance.\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He was finally taken into police custody three months after Vasilije’s death and extradited back to Canada in January 2018.\n \n He was found \nguilty of second-degree murder on May 25\n.\n \n HASAN’S SPEAKS OUT\n \n “There are zero excuses for taking someone’s life,” Hasan told the court on the second day of his sentencing hearing. “She should be alive, having kids of her own with a partner.”\n \n He said he couldn’t forgive himself for Vasilije’s death.\n \n “It makes little sense to ask for forgiveness,” he added. “I cannot, and will not, forgive myself.”\n \n Hasan also told the court he wants to dedicate a portion of his life to combat intimate partner violence.\n \n ‘COMPLETE LACK OF REMORSE’\n \n The mandatory sentence for second-degree murder is life in prison with no chance of parole for 10 to 25 years, depending on the judge’s discretion.\n \n The Crown asked for a sentence of 18 years, beyond the normal guidelines for this type of crime, arguing that the court needs to send a “message against domestic homicide.”\n \n Hasan admitted to killing Vasilije during his trial but claimed she attacked him first. He said he \nstabbed her twice before blacking out\n.\n \n When asked if he intended to kill her, Hasan answered “no,”\n \n “I should be in jail for a very long time, but I swear to God, I lost control. Convict me for life, I don’t care… but I blacked out. Don’t try to say I did this in the right mind,” he said on the stand. “I killed her, yes. I didn’t do this out of anger. I didn’t do this because we didn’t get back together. It happened because I was an […] idiot, it’s all just hitting me.”\n \n The Crown’s submissions stated Vasilije did not attack Hasan first and that Hasan was the only attacker – bringing up the fact that he used two knives.\n \n “This is a serious homicide with 47 stab wound, using two knives in multiple locations,” said Crown Attorney Brendan Thomas. “It was a brutal, vicious killing in the victim’s home.”\n \n He added that at the time of Vasilije's death, a court order stated Hasan was not allowed in Waterloo Region or permitted to speak with Vasilije.\n \n \"Hasan immediately and continously breached a court order from an April 3rd altercation at Vasilije's apartment,\" Thomas continued.\n \n He also pointed out that Hasan only started participating in “in-prison programs” after his conviction in June 2023.\n \n Thomas added that Hasan taunted Vasilije’s family after her death.\n \n “[He] sent a vicious message to the mother of the victim and left a vicious [social media] post on the ‘Justice for Melinda’ Facebook page,” Thomas said. “A complete lack of remorse on the behalf of the accused.”\n \n The defense argued there’s no proof Hasan was responsible for the Facebook post and message, saying others also had access to his phone while he was on the run in the U.S.\n \n The defense has requested a sentence of 14 to 15 years for Vasilije’s death, asking the court to consider Hasan's violent and turbulent childhood. They also argue that Hasan has shown remorse and taken partial accountability, and stands a better chance of rehabilitation with the support of his family and friends.\n \n PLEA FROM THE FAMILY\n \n The court, in making its sentencing decision, will also consider \nvictim impact statements\n.\n \n Seven of them were read in court on Wednesday.\n \n Vasilije’s mother, Anna Todorivic, tearfully called Melinda: “My heart, my soul, my best friend.”\n \n She said she looks at her daughter’s photo every night and cries herself to sleep.\n \n “The day she died I was destroyed … a part of me is gone with her,” Todorivic said. “Melinda longed to be a mother… I will never get to hold her babies.”\n \n \nMelinda Vasilije appears in an undated photo. (Submitted)\n \n Vasilije’s sister Kristina said she “remember[s] the agonizing pain in my mother’s scream.”\n \n She said she constantly thinks: “Is there anything I could have done different, if I stayed in the apartment?”\n \n SENTENCING HEARING\n \n Hasan’s parole eligibility began on July 11, 2017, the day of his arrest.\n \n On Friday morning a sentencing date was set for Sept. 27.\n \n \n-- With reporting by CTV's Jeff Pickel\n\n", "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He said he was confident about the language's future.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tBut some Metro Vancouver Cantonese speakers say its fate is uncertain in its homeland, and overseas communities play a vital role in its preservation.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe concerns come after the shutdown of an online group promoting Cantonese in late August, after authorities in Hong Kong said content on the website violated the city's national security laws.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tMandarin - China's official spoken language - is increasingly taught and promoted in Hong Kong, even though education officials there have denied plans to switch Chinese instruction away from Cantonese. But Cantonese advocacy has been associated with a localist movement that is facing suppression in Hong Kong.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tZoe Lam, a lecturer at the University of British Columbia's Cantonese language and culture program, said the situation in Hong Kong means language learning has been inevitably politicized - something that is much less of an issue in overseas communities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tIt means Cantonese speakers and learners can view overseas Chinese communities as a “very safe space,” which can promote the language's survival and growth.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“I think these will be major hubs of overseas Cantonese communities,” she said of cities including Vancouver and Toronto. “That's why our language program also wants to play the role of the education hub of Cantonese in North America.”\n\r\n\n\r\n\tUBC offers Canada's only comprehensive, for-credit Cantonese-language university program, and enrolment has climbed steadily from 67 when the courses launched in 2015 to 559 last school year.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tCommunity members said they have seen a new wave of Cantonese speakers in places such as Metro Vancouver in recent years, triggered in part by an exodus of Hong Kong residents amid a crackdown on political dissent.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tData from the 2021 census released last year showed a 6.1 per cent increase of Hong Kong-born people in Vancouver's census metropolitan area in the past five years, where it had previously been falling for decades.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tThe census also showed about 183,000 people in Vancouver's census area claimed Cantonese as their mother tongue in 2021, up by about 38 per cent from 133,000 in 2011.\n\r\n\n\r\n\tNon-profit group HK House runs the annual Vancouver Hong Kong Fair. Board member Agnes Hui said she and a significant number of friends moved from Hong Kong to Canada last year, joining a new pathway to permanent residency.\n\r\n\n\r\n\t“From my circle, I have quite of lot of friends coming to other cities, including Vancouver, Toronto and even Ottawa and Calgary,” Hui said. “So it is true that there's a gr,

Stylistically, they dressed up, they stripped down. They were drunk with life, they were sobering. They pushed pleasure on us even while they occasionally provoked and puzzled us.

There was no sign of interference from the amateur archaeologists who swept the Beothuk Lake region years ago with metal detectors, digging up all manner of artifacts and leaving little in the ground.\nIt was the rarest find in that region for decades.\n\"At the time that it was discovered it was the only known Beothuk house pit in that region … that had not been impacted by erosion or unauthorized digging,\" said provincial archaeologist Jamie Brake. \nJamie Brake, Newfoundland and Labrador's provincial archaeologist, says more excavations are planned for the area so as much can be learned as possible before the site is lost to erosion.\n \n(Ted Dillon/CBC)\nBeothuk Lake was the last refuge for Newfoundland's Indigenous group. They struggled with European diseases, violent encounters, and losing crucial migration routes to colonization. Shawnadithit, widely recognized as the last Beothuk, died in 1829. \nResidents around Beothuk Lake have raised concerns that the last remaining archaeological sites could be lost due to water levels on the lake, which doubles as a hydroelectric reservoir.\nAfter the site was discovered, Brake said, archaelogists were concerned about erosion and teams have taken action to learn all they can from the house pit before it gets swallowed by the lake.\nBeothuk Lake is at risk of losing its last archaeological sites to coastal erosion\nWhat's been done to protect the site\nThe area was mapped by drones, and the land was surveyed in and around the house pit. Crews removed trees that were deemed to be at risk of falling over and damaging the site.\nArchaeologists have spent parts of three summers excavating the most vulnerable parts — removing important artifacts before they're lost to erosion.\nA pair of Beothuk deer spears were uncovered near the site. Brake says they're perhaps the best preserved example of the tool used to hunt caribou.\n \n(Submitted by Jamie Brake)\nAmong the items found were a pair of deer spears — metal rods taken from European settlements and sharpened at the tip to kill caribou. Brake said they're perhaps the best preserved spears uncovered by archaeologists. \nThis harpoon tip was found near the remnants of a Beothuk mamateek on Beothuk Lake. Its presence at an inland site shows the continued importance of coastal seal hunting right to the end of the Beothuk period, says Brake.\n \n(Submitted by Jamie Brake)\nAnother item found was a pointed piece of iron, which is an exact match to a drawing done by Shawnadithit depicting the end blade for a harpoon that would have been used for sealing.\nShawnadithit was one of the last Beothuk people, captured by English furriers in 1823. She died of tuberculosis in 1829.\nBrake said more excavations are planned for the area, to learn as much as they can before the site is lost to erosion.\nArtifacts tell a story\nThe items found help archaeologists date the site to the late 1700s or early 1800s, Brake said, which falls toward the end of the Beothuk period. \nIts location is also important. While water is now sloshing against the walls of the house pit, it would have been located deep inland before Beothuk Lake was dammed and flooded in the early 1900s.\nIt dates to a period where the Beothuk were trying to hide from Europeans who were taking over important hunting and fishing grounds, Brake said. \nIn that context, the presence of a sealing tool is a curious find — since there are no seals in the middle of Newfoundland. Brake said it shows the Beothuk still must have trekked to the coast at some point, despite moving further inland to avoid detection.\n\"It's probably a good indication of the continued importance of the coast for these people right to the end,\" Brake said. \nMore discoveries possible — but leave it to professionals\nThe discovery of an inland site sparks some hope that more could be discovered in places that haven't been searched before — not just at Beothuk Lake, but in other areas around the province. \nBrake said it's important that work be done by archaeologists. An artifact taken without proper study is an artifact lost, he said. \n\"If it's pulled out of its context, you lose its meaning,\" Brake said. \"[It's] sort of like taking a word out of a page of a book. Once it's taken out of its context, you can no longer understand what it is, what its meaning is.\"\nBeothuk Lake erosion threatens homes and cultural sites\n12 days ago\nDuration \n2:57\nA group of Newfoundland residents are concerned about water levels around Beothuk Lake. They say Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro is keeping levels too high, endangering both their property and archaeological sites of the extinct Beothuk culture.\nThe stakes are huge, Brake said. Every item can go a long way to discover more about a people who are no longer here to share their own history.\n\"There's such a small amount of of surviving Beothuk material in existence today,\" Brake said. \"We lose a tremendous sort of opportunity to learn more about these people.

Jutting out into the ocean on the tip of southwestern Newfoundland, the fishing community is home to around 4,000 people. Almost a year later, some residents are grappling with whether to rebuild or move away — a question tied to whether they can ever feel safe again so close to the ocean. \nWATCH | Port aux Basques home becomes a symbol of Fiona's destruction: \nPort aux Basques home becomes a symbol of Fiona’s destruction\n12 months ago\nDuration \n3:02\nThe now-iconic picture of Josh Savery’s family home in Port aux Basque, N.L., teetering on the edge of a cliff captured the terror of post-tropical storm Fiona in a single image. While the famous picture reminds the family of what they lost, it also attracted an outpouring of sympathy and kindness.\nAs the storm receded last year, news reports around the world \ncarried a picture of Peggy's house\n, already battered by the storm and slouching toward the churning ocean below. Moments after that photo was taken, a wave came over the top of the house and pulled it from the rocks it was built on.\nIt's not how Peggy likes to remember what she calls her \"dream home,\" with ocean views and a deck that stretched out over the water. She prefers to think of evenings on that deck with her husband Lloyd, stargazing and listening to the dark water lapping the shore below.\nShe visits the site a few times a week to see what the ocean has spat back, and try to wrap her mind around everything they've lost.\nIn the debris where her house used to stand, Savery often finds fragments of old belongings, from things like plates and cutlery to cat toys.\n \n(Brianna Gosse)\nThis section of wall is the last standing part of Savery's former home.\n \n(Brianna Gosse/CBC)\nThe couple and their son, Josh, have since moved into a new house, albeit one that doesn't quite feel like home yet. Their new place is further inland, away from the ocean that \"used to lull me to sleep at night,\" she said.\n\"Now I just look at it differently … I can't imagine sleeping here at night, sleeping this close to it. That'd be a little scary.\"\n'Panic in his voice'\nPeggy and Lloyd had intended to stay home and wait out the storm last year — until Lloyd went outside briefly to get timber, and noticed the roiling sea was higher than he'd ever seen it.\nHe rushed back inside to tell Peggy they had to leave. \n\"There was a bit of panic in his voice, but I still didn't take it serious and I said, 'Well, I'm going for a shower first,'\" Peggy said. \n\"And he just said, 'You don't have time. We have to go.'\"\nPeggy grabbed their cats, but Lloyd didn't stop to take even his wallet or his glasses. They went to his brother Ben's house, where the two men decided to check in on Ben's son Scott Savory, who lives right across the cove from his Aunt Peggy and Uncle Lloyd.\nWATCH | Drone video shows devastation in Port aux Basques, N.L.: \nDrone video shows devastation in Port aux Basques, N.L.\n12 months ago\nDuration \n0:53\nFootage shot over Port aux Basques, N.L., shows the damage caused by post-tropical storm Fiona.\nScott's house is about 10 metres above sea level and 30 metres from the shoreline, but waves were already hitting it. The younger man was trying to get his motorcycle out of his garage, and enlisted his father's help.\n\"We weren't here for 10 seconds, and another wave hit and caved my garage door in and pretty much pinned myself and my dad back in a corner,\" said Scott.\nThe water was waist high but they managed to push off the debris and make for the exit. \n\"We got out front and we noticed that Uncle Lloyd was standing just on top of the hill there watching towards his house — and his house was getting demolished.\"\nThe shoreline beside Peggy's former home.

There's a watermark half a metre up his walls, yet the house itself is still standing. \nBut his home is one of 60 buildings that have been marked for demolition, in an impact zone close to the ocean. The provincial government has ruled it's just not safe for anyone to live there.\nScott has to be out by spring. \n\"It's going to be heartbreaking to give up what I worked so hard for over the last ten, 12 years,\" he said.\nHe intends to stay in the community, but he too struggles with being close to the ocean. He watches weather reports for storm warnings, and feels Fiona took away his \"peace of mind.\"\nHe said the bigger loss is not having his aunt and uncle just across the way. Before the storm, he would often pop in after work to sit on their deck and enjoy a beer together.\nNot being able to \"look over and yell at Lloyd and Peg … it just changed everything,\" he said.\nScott Savory's house survived the storm, but he's been told it must be demolished because it's too close to the ocean. \n \n(Brianna Gosse/CBC)\nThe emotional fallout and \"intangible costs of climate change are things that we often forget about,\" said Kelly Vodden, a professor in the environmental policy institute at Grenfell Campus at Memorial University. \n\"To have to move away from the coast where they have their identity and connections and histories, certainly there's an incredible cost there,\" she said.\nAndrew Parsons, Channel-Port aux Basques's representative in provincial parliament, said ongoing mental health support is available to people whose homes are due for demolition — as well as the wider community. \n\"The impact wasn't just those who lost homes ... it's really been a cumulative effect on the entire community. But supports have been provided,\" said Parsons, who is member of the house of assembly for Burgeo-La Poile and also the province's minister of industry, energy and technology.\nTo stay or go\nPeggy's other nephew, Shawn Savery, also suffered extensive damage to his home in Channel-Port aux Basques — but his house isn't in the demolition zone, which means no buy-out. \n\"The foundation has cracked, the siding has cracked. My sewer system was demolished, my basement was flooded out with probably three feet of water,\" he said.\nShawn Savery's home was heavily damaged, but is not included in the demolition zone.\n \n(Brianna Gosse/CBC)\nShawn said his family was thinking about moving before the storm hit, but he doubts he'd find a buyer now and isn't even sure he'd be comfortable selling.  \n\"I wouldn't be able to sell to anybody knowing that they could themselves be put in danger,\" he said. That leaves him in \"a tough place,\" he added, made worse by the fear that another storm could hit.\n \nIn June, the \nprovincial government said in a statement\n that it had outlined an impact zone in collaboration with town officials, \"based on objective, evidence-based considerations including the debris line of the storm surge, aerial photography and on-site verification.\" Property owners had been notified, and were receiving support from the provincial government, the statement said.\nParsons said the work of deciding the impact zone's borders was \"very much done with empathy in mind,\" and added that he feels for people who might want to be included — but aren't.\nBut he said there is no solution that would have been satisfactory for everyone.\nParsons, who is from Channel-Port aux Basques, said it's been personally hard to watch the changes to the community, especially \"where you've got an entire neighbourhood that's almost no longer in existence.\"\nAndrew Parsons, MHA for Burgeo-La Poile, said work of deciding the impact zone’s borders was “very much done with empathy in mind.\" \n \n(Mike Simms/CBC)\nBut he's confident that the fabric of Channel-Port aux Basques can survive, even through the difficulties.\n\"Right now I still think that it is an everyday issue in the community for a number of people,\" he told \nThe Current\n.\n\"My hope is that it gets to the point where it becomes a memory, and not something that we are still living. But that takes time.\"\nThe next storm\nVodden said that extreme weather events are going to \"become more severe and more frequent\" due to climate change, and communities like Channel-Port aux Basques need help to be ready.\n\"We need to put more resources and effort into helping communities understand what their climate change vulnerabilities are, and what some of the [adaptation] options are,\" she said.\nShe said different areas will have different needs, so planning discussions must have local input — particularly with remote communities that find it hard to \"get the ear of decision-makers.\"\nPeggy's father brought her this candlestick when she was 17. After the storm, it was retrieved from the ocean floor. \n \n(Brianna Gosse/CBC)\nShe said the risk of a failed strategy is division within a community, or even outright conflict where a government tries to move residents from homes they don't want to give up. But she added that the destruction of Fiona has helped many people face up to what's a \"tough conversation.\"\n\"Maybe some of the education also has to be in areas outside of these rural and remote communities about … how they need support in order to adjust,\" she said.\nPeggy said the storm has been a wake up call for her around climate change — but the wider world needs to pay attention too. \nBack at her new house, a big storage box holds some of the sentimental-but-broken things she finds on the shoreline. But other items are on display, including a candlestick that her father bought her when she was 17.\n\"Lloyd's nephew went diving one day to see how bad it was down there.

We don't want to damage where we're growing our products,\" he said.\nThe Newfoundland and Labrador aquaculture industry is dominated by salmon farming, but the provincial government is investing in a fund to help the industry diversify into other species and plants.\n \n(Northern Harvest Sea Farms)\nAquaculture production soared to nearly 20,000 tonnes in 2021, a nearly 90 per cent increase over the previous year. The value of the industry also increased to $189 million in 2021, according to the latest information available from the Fisheries Department.\nThat growth is expected to continue, with Grieg N.L. expected to harvest at least 5,000 tonnes of salmon in Placentia Bay this fall.\nBut critics continue to hammer the industry over concerns about disease outbreaks, pesticide use and fish escapes from sea-based cages.\nThat criticism is brushed off by the fisheries minister, who calls critics naysayers.\n\"This industry is going to continue, is going to thrive, and is going to provide protein for the world demand,\" said Loveless.\n\"I'm happy to be here this morning to talk about it in a positive light, not in a negative one, to say that this industry is alive and well and we're supporting it and fish is going to continue to grow.\"\n \nWe are going to hold companies' feet to the fire in terms of the environment, absolutely.\n- Elvis Loveless\nLoveless visited a world leader in aquacuture, Norway, last month, and he said companies there are looking to invest in Canada.\n\"We know there's potential for growth and we'll see that in the months and years to come,\" he said.\nWhen challenged about the environmental concerns, Loveless said, \"We are going to hold companies' feet to the fire in terms of the environment, absolutely.\"\nThe provincial government wants annual production to grow to 50,000 tonnes, and George says that's achievable, though it might take longer than planned.\n\"I always say you gotta get good before you get big. So the industry gotta be improved and be consistent and then grow numberwise. So I think we will get there,\" said George.\nThe Fisheries Department hopes diversifying the industry will help with that growth.\nNew multi-species R&D fund\nLoveless announced a new multi-species research and development fund during his speech to delegates, with up to $150,000 annually for the next three years.\nFarming companies, research groups and Indigenous organizations can apply for grants of up to $50,000 to study the feasibility of farming cultured plants such as seaweed and new aquaculture species such as wolf fish and sea urchins.\n\"The program supports our government's commitment to establishing Newfoundland and Labrador as a global leader in responsible aquaculture production while providing economic stability in rural areas,\" said Loveless.\nThe aquaculture industry is largely based on Newfoundland's south coast, in regions such as the Coast of Bays.\nHermitage-Sandyville Mayor Steve Crewe is one of the industry's biggest champions, because he's seen first-hand the benefits it has brought to his and other communities.\n'Lots of money to go around': mayor\nBefore the arrival of aquaculture, the local fish plant operated for 14 weeks each year, and workers struggled to get by. Now the plant operates for 50 weeks, he said, and workers are thriving.\n\"There's lots of money to go around,\" said Crewe.\nCrewe said there is full employment in the region, and for the first time, temporary foreign workers began showing up this year.\n\"[Aquaculture] is what's keeping us down there. And they're high-paying jobs,\" Crewe added.\nCrewe said new homes are being built, the accommodations sector is expanding, and households that once earned $20,000 annually are now over $100,000.\nAnother sign of prosperity? Hermitage-Sandyville is a town of 400 residents, with a tax collection rate of 99 per cent, said Crewe.\n\"I'm still looking for that one per cent,\" he joked.\nGet the news you need without restrictions.

He last saw his mother 16 months ago, weeks after Russia began its attack on Ukraine.", "content": "In May 2022, Serhii Semenets fled his home country of Ukraine to move in with Kelly Power, whom he'd never met, in St. John's.\n \n(The Canadian Press)\nIn many ways, Serhii Semenets is like any other 17-year-old starting Grade 11 in Newfoundland this week. He likes playing guitar, he struggles with Shakespeare and his ideal dinner is a plate of poutine.\nBut unlike most kids at Holy Heart of Mary High School, Semenets is 6,000 kilometres away from his family; he last saw his mother 16 months ago. Weeks after Russia began its attack on Ukraine last year, Semenets's mother hurried him onto a bus to Warsaw just in time for him to board a plane to Newfoundland. He got on the plane by himself; his mother returned to the war.\n\"It was a little bit hard to say goodbye,\" Semenets said in a recent interview. \"Because you're going to another country without your family and you don't know when you will come back.\"\nRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Shortly after, the Newfoundland and Labrador government announced it would open an office in Warsaw to help fleeing Ukrainians relocate to Canada's easternmost province. Over the next nine months, the government chartered four flights to carry Ukrainians from Warsaw to St. John's.\nMore than 2,400 Ukrainians have since settled in more than 30 communities, the province's Association for New Canadians has said.\nSemenets arrived on the first plane, on May 9, 2022, with about 165 other Ukrainians. He moved in with a woman he had not met before: Kelly Power, who used to work at a pharmacy with Semenets's older sister. Shortly after Russia began its assault, Semenets's sister asked Power if she would take in her little brother.\n\"I have no regrets. Not one regret,\" Power said in a recent interview, her eyes filling up as she sat beside the teenager.\nPower said Semenets's family recounted that shortly before his 17th birthday, officials from the Ukrainian army came looking for him, wanting to conscript him into the army the day he turned 18.\nBut he was already safe in St. John's, living with Power and her 26-year-old son.\nArrival\nIn the airport when he arrived in May, Semenets was shy and reserved, avoiding the journalists who gathered to report on the flight. But on a recent afternoon in downtown St. John's, he looked at least six inches taller, towering above Power in a black hoodie and with chin-length black hair. After a year of school and English tutoring, he spoke confidently, opening up about the ways the people in Newfoundland — like Power and his teachers — have made him feel welcome.\nHe gave a particularly enthusiastic review of Christmas in his \"second home.\" Power showered him with gifts and made him a holiday meal of poutine and orange cheesecake — a nod to the importance of oranges in Ukrainian Christmas celebrations.\nPower, he said, \"has given me everything I need to be at home.\"\nSemenets and Power are close. They have shared jokes, and they jostle each other affectionately when they talk about his messy room.\n\"He's like my second child now,\" Power said. \"After my son graduated, I never thought I'd be back at parent-teacher meetings or getting ready for school and fighting to do homework. But we're doing it. We're rocking it.\"\nDozens of Ukrainian refugees arrived at St. John's International Airport on a government-chartered flight in June 2022. \n \n(Ted Dillon/CBC)\nIn the middle of the interview, she stepped away to take a phone call. It was someone in Ottawa confirming that his passport application had arrived. She's trying to send him to Italy in November for a visit with his mother.\nGetting his passport in order — and his work permit, health card and other official paperwork — has been difficult, she said. Canada has welcomed Ukrainians and granted them temporary residency status and work permits, but Semenets's arrival as an unaccompanied minor has added bureaucratic delays.\nStarting school\nHe started Grade 10 last September in downtown St. John's. There are about a dozen other Ukrainians at his school, and they support each other in navigating a new school in a new language, he said. Teachers have provided the students with tests and assignments translated into Ukrainian to help them out.\nHe was nervous when he started last year, he said, but not this year. His English is much better and he knows what to expect. He has a core group of five Ukrainian friends, and they like to go walking around the city.\n\"It's very beautiful nature here,\" Semenets said, adding that he especially likes hiking to the top of Signal Hill, which looks over downtown St. John's and out over the ocean.\n Semenets is starting Grade 11 at Holy Heart of Mary High School. \n \n(Paul Daly/CBC)\nHe and his friends don't often talk about what they've been through, he said.\nSchool is easier in Newfoundland than it is in Ukraine, Semenets said, explaining that there are fewer classes in Canada and therefore less homework. With more time on his hands in St. John's, he got a part-time job at a grocery store.\nHe regularly video chats with his mother and father back home. They're safe, \"but it's hard to say 'safe' when you're living in Ukraine,\" he said.\nHis friends from Ukraine are now scattered across Europe, and due to the time differences, he wakes up at 5 a.m. to text and message them.\nIt likely won't be safe for Semenets to return home before he turns 18, he said. In the meantime, he wants to keep working and save money for when he finally can go back to Ukraine. He misses home, but he's happy in St. John's.\n\"I am not living a very hard life here, because Kelly makes it easy for me,\" Semenets said. \"I'm living with a beautiful family who helped me with everything. I don't have a very hard life.\"\nGet the news you need without restrictions.

Hydro mulls building new diesel-powered turbine\nA $600M solution: Holyrood thermal plant can back up Muskrat Falls for another 8 years\nWithout the knowledgeable people at both Liberty and the PUB — which regulates utilities in Newfoundland and Labrador — Penney said the public would never have known about the Muskrat Project delays, among other issues with a megaproject that was announced when Danny Williams was premier and which is still not fully operational.\nHowever, Penney has his doubts over Liberty's future replacement, pointing out that the province recently appointed Kevin Fagan as the board's chairperson.\n\"I'm sure he's very competent and so on, but it's a very big conflict of interest because he was in charge of regulatory affairs,\" said Penney.\n\"And coming up, probably next year, is the rate application to pay for Muskrat Falls, and he's been in the thick of that.\"\nPenney thinks that potential conflict of interest could mean Fagan will not be able to participate in important hearings.\nSlow and steady\nThere are reliability concerns with the \nLabrador Island Link\n that brings Muskrat power to this province and Nova Scotia, and that a backup will be needed.\nAt the moment, \nthe backup\n is the Holyrood thermal generating station, which is an older facility and a polluter, as it burns heavy fuel oil to produce power.\nN.L. Hydro extends life expectancy of Holyrood plant by another year as Muskrat delays continue\nHydro \nis anticipating\n greater demand for its power as more consumers switch to electric vehicles and ditch oil heating their homes.\nOne of the issues Antonuk\n \nraised in his letter was around N.L. Hydro delaying considering adding a gas turbine capacity to the Holyrood generating station, which he said could increase power reliability.\n   \nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador\n  \nHe wrote, \"if proven feasible, the timing for installing such a resource may have the potential to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars from extending Holyrood.\"\nHydro CEO Jennifer Williams was not available for an interview. \nIn a statement, the Crown corporation defended its slow and steady approach.\nAn independent assessment of the Holyrood thermal generating station has determined the oil-fired power plant can continue to operate for another decade as a backup to Muskrat Falls.\n \n(Terry Roberts/CBC)\n\"The utility regulatory process is a transparent and thorough process, one that we value and one that will continue to play a critical role as Hydro and others ready our future electrical system to meet customer's expectations,\" it stated.\nIt also contained a rebuff to Antonuk's letter regarding the addition of gas turbines at Holyrood.\n\"We also are insistent that we do the appropriate work to gather all evidence necessary to make well-informed and prudent decisions that benefit the people of this province,\" the statement said.\n\"Hydro intends to honour the lessons of past decisions as we look to the future, and rushing, in our view, is not prudent.\"It added that N.L.

Their salaries are now more in line with Nova Scotia, but prosecutors there are currently negotiating for more money to account for an increase in the cost of living.\nPatten commended the province for listening to their concerns but said money is just one piece of the pie.\n\"We've essentially got the same amount of lawyers more or less that we've had within the last 10 years, but our file loads have actually doubled,\" Patten said.\n\"On top of that, not only have the files doubled, we're seeing more severe and extreme crime.\"\nA report released in July by Statistics Canada backs that up.\nBetween 2021 and 2022 in Newfoundland and Labrador there was a six per cent increase in the crime severity index, which takes into account the change in volume of a particular crime and the relative seriousness of that crime in comparison with others. It has risen 21 per cent in the province over the last decade.\n\"I acknowledge that the increase in salaries are going to help with retention and recruitment. That's a long-term thing,\" said Patten.\n\"But certainly if people are just going with attrition and you're recruiting new people to replace them, that's not necessarily going to help us with the increase in file load that we've seen over the last 10 years.\"\nCraig Pope's case is the oldest of all homicide cases before the courts in Newfoundland and Labrador.

The original Fredericton location is about 10 kilometres from downtown.\nPublic safety couldn't find any records\nCBC filed a right to information request to the Department of Justice and Public Safety for records about how the minister reached the decision to abandon the Fredericton jail site.\nThe department told CBC it \"failed to retrieve any records relevant to your request.\"\nBut it's not because records on the topic don't exist. A separate request to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure uncovered numerous emails back and forth between senior officials in the transportation and public safety departments, leading up to the province's announcement that it would abandon the Fredericton site.\nThe plan to build a $32-million provincial jail in the Fredericton area was first announced in December 2021, with then-Public Safety Minister Ted Flemming saying the correctional system was \"stretched.\" Since taking over the portfolio in October 2022, Austin has been steadfast on the need for the jail, citing rising crime.\n   \n \nProvince didn't do analysis of corrections system before deciding to build Fredericton-area jail, records show\n \n  \nCriminologists and opponents of the jail have argued the money should be spent to address issues such as homelessness and addiction instead.\nFredericton site scored highest in review of 16 locations\nIn early January, staff in the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure briefed Comeau on the process of selecting the site, ahead of a presentation at Fredericton council. \nMike Cashin, a senior project engineer in the department's buildings division, explained the site selection was facilitated by the infrastructure department. Public Safety reviewed and approved the criteria for the site, while Cashin reviewed each site to give it a score.\nCashin's email says 16 properties in the greater Fredericton and Oromocto area were reviewed, and four were shortlisted for deeper review. The Vanier Industrial Park area site scored highest. \nThe criteria included being within city limits, close to mental health and addiction services, having good street and highway access, and not being immediately adjacent to residential areas. \nThis parcel of land near the Vanier Industrial Park was the original location for the jail, based on criteria such as its proximity to downtown Fredericton and the distance from homes.\n \n(Google Earth)\nHours after Comeau received the information, he was among several speakers who addressed a packed Fredericton council chamber, including some who opposed the construction of a new jail. Later that month, council approved the rezoning of the land, paving the way toward the sale of the land for the jail.\n   \n \nOpponents of Fredericton jail proposal pack council chamber to hear public comments\n \n  \nBut the sale wouldn't happen.\nOn Jan. 30, a week after Fredericton council's vote, Comeau wrote to several people in the public safety and transportation departments, saying he needed a briefing note for multiple ministers. \nThe note should cover the site selection, status of the agreement with the city, and \"implications should [the government of New Brunswick] for some reason decide not to finalize this purchase and build somewhere else,\" he wrote.\nComeau said both departments should be \"fully aligned,\" noting he'd been confused about who selected the site for the jail up until that very morning.\n\"Let's make sure we're in agreement on whatever are those facts,\" Comeau wrote.\nOn a Sunday morning a few days later, Comeau emailed several people, including Premier Blaine Higgs, Austin and Carr, with the subject line: \"advice to Ministers: Fredericton Region Correctional Centre site selection.\" \nThe contents of the email — marked of \"high\" importance — were redacted in the copy provided to CBC.\n'There really is no other site worth targeting'\nIn late February, staff in the transportation department were called to a meeting with the premier to discuss the jail. It's not clear what happened in that meeting. No notes were included in the records given to CBC.\nA few days later, Comeau sent Austin, Carr and deputy transportation minister Taylor his argument for why the province shouldn't scrap its plans in Fredericton.\n\"I think we need to ensure we are moving in the right direction and be able to rationalize it to the local MLA and residents,\" Austin wrote back to Comeau. \"If there are other options that are easier to swallow I'm open to hearing about them as well.\"\nPublic Safety Minister Kris Austin has been adamant that New Brunswick needs a new jail in the Fredericton region. It will be built in Minto in his riding.\n \n(Aniekan Etuhube/CBC)\nComeau doubled down, and sent a lengthy email to Austin, Carr and Taylor, saying staff in his department who were part of the process concluded \"there really is no other site worth targeting,\" listing several \"disadvantages of cancelling this deal and starting over with a search outside the city.\" \nHe wrote that 75 to 80 out of 100 people in the new jail are expected to be local to Fredericton.\n\"The further we get from Fredericton, the longer the drive to move inmates to jail and back, and longer drives mean more risk of escape and collision (and thus cost and injury), more gas and employee time consumed,\" Comeau wrote.\n\"It also takes the inmates further away from support services and their loved ones.\"\nComeau also argued the province couldn't guarantee it would quickly find a parcel of land elsewhere that wouldn't draw the same opposition as the site in Fredericton.\n\"Jail can draw NIMBY [not in my backyard] fury outside of Lincoln Heights,\" he wrote. \n   \n \nLack of open Q&A at Minto jail meeting leaves sour taste for some at packed public meeting\n \n  \nComeau's argument didn't seem to have an effect. The next day, staff in the infrastructure department were asked \"for points describing the disadvantages of relocating jail build to [the second- and third-ranked sites] or to a rural area.\" The addresses of the second- and third-ranked sites were redacted in CBC's records.\n\"Clearly somebody is still pushing against this decision,\" Mike Johnston, the assistant deputy minister of public safety, wrote.\nPrice of jail has climbed $10 million \nTransportation staff warned that the second- and third-ranked sites weren't feasible options because they were too close to residential areas. They also warned the province would be facing higher costs to build infrastructure for the jail outside the city.\nThe province opted to cancel plans for the Fredericton site anyway, announcing the decision on May 29, months after residents in the area first raised concerns about the location. \nWhen the province announced the new site in Minto on July 31, it noted the jail is now expected to cost about $42 million, which is $10 million more than the original estimate in December 2021.\nNeither Carr, Austin nor Comeau were made available for an interview with CBC to explain why the province made the decision when it did. Fredericton Mayor Kate Rogers also wasn't made available for an interview.\n   \nFredericton to seek more than $100K in costs associated with cancelled jail plan\n  \n\"We have no additional comments to make about the location of the correctional centre and no update to provide on seeking reimbursement,\" City of Fredericton spokesperson Wayne Knorr wrote in an email.", "author": [{"name": "Karissa Donkin", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/author/karissa-donkin-1.4292802", "email": "NBInvestigates@CBC.ca", "about": "Karissa Donkin is a journalist in CBC's Atlantic investigative unit.

So just being able to maintain the same number without a primary care provider is still a gain in terms of number of people that are covered,\" he said.\nDeputy health minister Eric Beaulieu said collaborative care practices are another focus of the department, and he expects to see another two to four open across the province in the next few months.\n \n(Government of New Brunswick)\nBeaulieu acknowledged the intent of Health Link is to be a temporary placement until a permanent primary care provider can be identified for a patient.\nSo far, a total of 1,853 people who went through Patient Connect have managed to secure a primary care provider, he said.\nMcKee asked if the department has specific targets and timelines with the provincewide roll out.\nBeaulieu said the two primary goals are for every New Brunswicker to have a primary provider \"with a leading physician,\" and access within five days.\n\"We don't have a deadline, I'll say it that way, but it is a measure that we monitor on a monthly basis with expected improvements every single month.\n\"Our initial objective, our initial primary health-care plan, was an 18-month plan and we're about six months into that.\"\nProvince restores blood-work referrals to eVisitNB service\nMcKee noted that when the government took over recruitment from the regional health authorities in 2020, the goal was to give every New Brunswicker a doctor within six months. \"As you know, this target was not met.\"\nWhen the government released its health reform plan, one of the action items was to fully address the waitlist for access to primary care by the end of September 2022. Again, the target was not met, McKee said.\n\"Primary care is the biggest challenge that is faced across the country, not just New Brunswick,\" replied Beaulieu.\nFormer Tory health minister Dorothy Shephard pointed out Nova Scotia has a primary care waitlist of 148,000.\nN.B. Health Link \"is running behind,\" said Shephard, who was social services minister when she resigned from cabinet in June. \"It hasn't met any of the targets that we were told it could meet.\"\n\"However, it is certainly going to be one-of-a-kind throughout the country and is ensuring that people are not left without primary care.\"\nBeaulieu agreed. \"As a model, I think other jurisdictions are looking at it because it is quite promising.\"\nSeek to recruit 120 family doctors\nNew Brunswick also seeks to recruit 120 family physicians this fiscal year, he told the legislature's standing committee on public accounts. He could not provide an update on its progress to date.\nIn 2021-22, the province recruited 45 doctors, but lost 17, for a net gain of 28.\n\"We've seen an increase since then in terms of number of physicians recruited and we will also see corresponding increase in the number of physicians leaving simply because of age.\" Beaulieu said.\nAs of March 31, 2022, New Brunswick had 916 active general practice family medicine doctors. They're not all necessarily full time, stressed Beaulieu. \"Some may only be working one day a week, right?\"\nThe regional distribution includes:\n   \nMoncton region, Zone 1 — 287.\n   \nSaint John region, Zone 2 —  182.\n   \nFredericton region, Zone 3 — 205.\n   \nEdmundston region, Zone 4 — 64.\n   \nCampbellton region, Zone 5 —  28.\n   \nBathurst region, Zone 6 — 98.\n   \nMiramichi region, Zone 7 —  46.\n  \nThe final six are not necessarily associated with one specific zone, Beaulieu said.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-05T18:30:50.482000", "date_modified": "2023-09-06T08:19:02.701000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

For example, New Brunswick did not have an updated pandemic plan, based on lessons learned from the H1N1 flu experience, he said.\nThe Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health was as the bottom of New COVID-19 decision-making hierarchy, the auditor general's report shows.\n \n(Office of the Auditor General)\nHe also found problems with the government's decision-making process, record keeping and communications.\n\"We found six instances out of 14 sampled restrictions in mandatory orders where public health measures were supported by verbal updates only,\" the report says.\nN.B. failed to ensure nursing homes were prepared for a pandemic, audit finds\nOne mandatory order from June 2020, that everyone who enters any building open to the general public must wear a face mask covering their mouth and nose, was revised the next day, \"after decision-makers asserted that it did not reflect the intended decision.\"\nHolder said this \"pointed out a significant gap.\"\n\"That wasn't leaving out a comma or a colon somewhere.

They work out of clinics, hospitals and patients' homes, with the option of home-birth if patients choose.\nThere are currently 16 midwives working at three sites in Nova Scotia — Halifax, Lunenburg and Antigonish.\nA recent letter from the Department of Health and Wellness to a legislative committee said an additional 5.5 full-time equivalent positions would have cleared the IWK's wait-list in 2022. However, funding for the program has been stagnant for the past four provincial budgets at around $2.3 million.\nA spokesperson for the department said the province \"has been focused on stabilizing midwifery services within existing teams and locations,\" while exploring future expansion.\nMany Inuit must fly south to give birth.

It's not like you can just increase the amount of midwives and solve this wait-list problem.

Anyone who does not live in the catchment areas of St. Martha's Hospital in Antigonish, the IWK in Halifax, and Fishermen's Memorial and South Shore Regional hospitals in Lunenburg County would not be able to access midwifery care, or be on a waiting list. \nNova Scotia signed on with the other three Atlantic provinces in 2022 to conduct a feasibility study for a regional midwifery school.

The department hired two infection prevention and control specialists to guide nursing homes on minimizing the spread of COVID-19.\n\"According to the department, the specialists made efforts to work with each home in outbreak, but with the number of nursing homes experiencing outbreaks they were unable to visit every home in person,\" \nthe report\n says.\n\"Departmental staff informed us the risk of contamination was high in nursing homes due to a lack of conformity with [infection prevention control] measures and poor PPE [personal protective equipment] competency among nursing home staff,\" such as some COVID units not utilizing PPE, not changing PPE between units, and improper donning and doffing procedures.\nAuditor General Paul Martin, pictured with his new deputy, Diedre Green, said a review of inspection results for a sample of 30 nursing homes found non-compliance with appropriate care staff ratios rose from 30 per cent in 2018 to 87 per cent in 2022. Non-compliance with the requirement for a full- time registered nurse at all times rose from 10 per cent to 40 per cent during the same period.\n \n(Jacques Poitras/CBC)\nThe department continued annual inspections of nursing homes during the pandemic and several areas of non-compliance were noted, \"however, enforcement options were limited as the department lacked enforcement mechanisms.\"\nAs it stands, the department can either modify a nursing home's licence, revoke it, or place a home into trusteeship. The department has been \"hesitant\" about the first two because of the hardship they could cause for residents, according to the report.\nAs a result, \"modified licences have been the primary enforcement mechanism and it has not proven to be an effective one.\"\nAreas of non-compliance increased during the pandemic, said Martin. For example, 20 nursing homes reported staffing levels as \"strained or critical,\" and 73 per cent of the homes did not meet nursing home design standards.\n\"Departmental staff informed us they believe a contributing factor to COVID-19 outbreaks was that older home layouts were not adequate to deal with airborne and communicable disease,\" the report says.\nThere is no formalized plan to bring nursing homes up to the design standards or convert double occupancy rooms into single rooms, as this would \"have a significant financial impact [and] cause patient backlog in hospitals.\"\n\"Nursing home risks remain unaddressed,\" Martin concluded.\nStaffing remains biggest challenge, says union\nSharon Teare, president of the New Brunswick Council of Nursing Home Unions, said she's not surprised by the auditor general's criticisms.\nThe biggest issue was, and remains, staffing, she said.\n\"I think any of the improvement we've seen is, you know, the utilization of staffing agencies, which is a real Band-Aid fix to the situation.\n\"Folks aren't staying. I know in our sector that we need continuity of care as well as the consistency.\"\nTeare is hopeful lessons will be learned. She contends that's owed to the seniors and the workers who take care of them.\nMartin made a total of eight recommendations, including that the department work with nursing homes to address key inspection non-compliance areas, particularly staffing levels, and that timely access to infection prevention and control specialists be ensured.\nGreen Party Leader David Coon told reporters he thinks the government should use its \nbudget surplus, now estimated at nearly $200 million\n, to improve the the salaries and working conditions of nursing home and special care home employees, and to upgrade homes to modern standards to \"ensure the infrastructure itself is more effective at resisting the transmission of viruses.\"\nScope of report criticized\nCoon said he's \"quite upset\" the auditor general looked at only roughly half the long-term care sector in his report. He questioned why Martin didn't also review the pandemic response at special care homes, which have about 6,000 residents, compared to about 5,000 in nursing homes.\nHe noted the first COVID outbreak at a long-term care home was at Manoir de la Vallée, a special care home in Atholville. The Manoir was also the site of the province's first COVID death — Daniel Ouellette, 84, and the first place where someone couldn't be with their loved one who was dying because of COVID restrictions.\nMartin \"really missed the opportunity to produce a report that in the end needs to be of a quality and of a comprehensiveness to enable us to ensure that we're better prepared for a variant that might come along that's COVID, that's going to be particularly problematic, or a new novel virus,\" Coon told reporters.\n\"And that's what concerns me because in the end this is all about being better prepared for what what we may face in the future, and this report doesn't do that for me.\"\nGreen Party Leader David Coon said the pandemic is not over.

So it's a really quick process.\" \nThe site of a forest fire can even be ideal for a lot of species, he said. \n\"You have lots of nutrients available, you have low competition. And so lots of plants will love that sort of environment and will be fierce competitors to actually fill the room, basically.\"\nD'Orangeville said even without fire to dramatically re-set the playing field, forests are always changing and species come and go. It's called forest succession.\nLoïc D'Orangeville, a professor in the forestry program at the University of New Brunswick, says even without fire to dramatically re-set the playing field, forests are always changing.\n \n(Submitted by Loïc D'Orangeville)\nWildfires simply give certain species an immediate jump on succession.\n\"Think about poplar, birch, cherries that are adapted to grow rapidly after such a massive disturbance. So they're the first ones to get in and grow fast, but then they die young and so they're going to be replaced by more shade-tolerant species.\" \nThose are \"later successional species\" that are then followed by \"climax species,\" like sugar maple and yellow birch, he said.\nThis drone shot was taken from the other side of Bill's Lake toward Bocabec Cove. The fire came down from Clark's Mountain and continued to burn to the left, toward Bocabec Cove, and to the right, toward Kerr's Ridge.\n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC)\nThat could mean that after several decades, the forest will end up looking exactly like it did before it burned. But, said D'Orangeville, there are now other factors at play, such as climate change. \n\"If we have a more stressful climate this might favour certain species over others.\"\nFrom 'hilltop to hilltop to hilltop': residents grapple with impact of fast-moving forest fire\nOne month later, Stein Lake fire still not considered officially out\nIn New Brunswick, there are boreal and temperate species that naturally grow back after harvesting — balsam fir, for example. \n\"But with climate change, we now know that it's less adapted to the warmer conditions. So you might have a shift towards more warm-adapted species like red maple.\" \nWhat grows back immediately will depend on the intensity of the fire, said D'Orangeville.\n\"Some trees actually do very well with burning. Some trees have really thick bark. They can recover from a fire.\"\nHe said red and white pine can withstand fire and \"actually take advantage of fires because it reduces competition and it allows them to grow better.\nD'Orangeville says dead trees are 'critical components of a healthy forest ecosystem.'\n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC)\nIn some other cases, such as trembling aspen, \"what you see burned is dead, but what you don't see underground is actually very alive and well, D'Orangville said. \"So it doesn't mean because the tree is dark and burned that the tree is dead.\"\nBut if the fire is severe enough, there are no trees left to grow back. That means regrowth will depend on the seeds of neighbouring stands and which species can get their seeds to the burned area. \nDead trees give life\nThe trees that were definitely killed by the fire will eventually fall over, said D'Orangeville. But until that happens, he said \"they'll become apartment buildings for lots of biodiversity.\"\n\"These dead trees are critical components of a healthy forest ecosystem,\" he said. \nAnd some of those dead trees can also be salvaged, said Sarah Dickson-Hoyle, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia's faculty of forestry, whose PhD is in fire ecology and wildfire recovery with First Nations.  \nTrees are often only charred on the outside, according to so they can still be used to prevent them from going to waste, Dickson-Hoyle says.\n \n(Roger Cosman/CBC)\nWhen vast areas of woodland are burned, \"there is often a real push\" to \"salvage-harvest\" what's left. \nShe said the trees are often only charred on the outside, so they can still be used, preventing them from going to waste. Typically, though, they have \"a shelf life\" of only a few years. \nFor Childs, it took about a month after the fire, but the deer eventually came back to his property.\nHe points out two fawns, still sporting their baby spots, nibbling at the foot of a blackened tree trunk. \n\"So the animals are back and, you know, I'm content.\"", "author": [{"name": "Mia Urquhart", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/author/mia-urquhart-1.5495969", "email": "mia.urquhart@cbc.ca", "about": "Mia Urquhart is a journalist with CBC New Brunswick, based in Saint John.

Then-president of the union Dean Stienburg said members felt morale was low and the workplace was hostile. \n   \n \nHalifax police union passes no-confidence vote on chief, union president calls for resignation\n \n  \nThe service has problems with adequate staffing, which \na recent report attributed in part to workplace injuries\n. The HRP has also \nhad difficulty attracting members\n fast enough to replace officers who retire or resign. \nAfter the meeting Wednesday, Darla Perry, the interim president of the union, said she found out Kinsella was retiring on Wednesday along with everybody else.\n\"Chief Kinsella's time with the Halifax Regional Police has been a trying time,\" said Perry. \"It's a difficult time for policing and we wish the chief happiness in his retirement.\"\nExaminations of policing\nDuring his time as chief, \nKinsella testified before the Mass Casualty Commission\n about the day a gunman killed 22 people across the province. \nHe told the commission he believed a public alert about the gunman should have been issued \"much earlier\" in the 13-hour event. \nWhile the Mass Casualty Commission spent a lot of time examining RCMP actions, it also drew conclusions that apply broadly to all police services and \nmany of its findings have yet to be implemented\n. \nThere is a review underway looking at police actions in August 2021 during a protest against the eviction of people from homeless camps in Halifax, pictured in this file photo.\n \n(Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press)\nAnother issue that will fall to Kinsella's successor is the results of \na review of the eviction\n of people from homeless camps in city parks in Aug. 2021. \n   \nWhat happened when Halifax police pepper-sprayed people protesting removal of shelters for homeless people\n  \nThe new chief will also take over at a time when the city is examining what role policing will have in community safety, as plans for more \ncivilian-led responses to mental health incidents and other issues are underway.\nKent said the April report on a transformation of policing, including possibly \nintegrating the city's municipal police and RCMP\n, will be a good roadmap for the new chief.\n\"This is an opportunity to bring someone to the table that really is well-suited for transformation because we've made a commitment to transformation,\" Kent told reporters after the meeting.\n\"Nova Scotia is being watched carefully and HRM is being watched carefully due to the number of things that have happened over the last number of years. So policing is changing and we can be a leader in that.\"\nKinsella thanks family\nIn his retirement announcement, Kinsella thanked his family for their \"undying support and love\" and also thanked the families of his team members for being a \"source of unconditional strength for them.\" \nHe alluded to the challenges of policing in the last few years, and said HRP members \"served with patience and fortitude while demonstrating a commitment to learn and modernize as an organization.\"\nKinsella said he has confidence that recent \"studies and engagements\" will help policing in HRM to keep evolving. \nMORE TOP STORIES \nCape Breton singer-songwriter Bruce Guthro dies at 62\nN.S. fire chief wants protection for volunteers who respond to emergencies while on the job\nRenters with pets need protection in tenancy rules, says animal-welfare charity\nClimate change is affecting telecommunications infrastructure.

That's following increases of 4.9 per cent in 2021, 3.9 per cent in 2020 and 3.7 per cent in 2019.\nAs a result, the report says, more people are being forced to cover housing costs with \"discretionary\" budget items such as food.\n\"This level of increase has not been seen in the previous 30 years. Significantly increasing investment in affordable housing with a priority on public and non-market is urgently needed,\" the report states.\nMinimum wage should be $20: report\nAs part of battling the rising cost of living, the report also calls for a tax system that more fairly reflects wage earners' ability to pay. It also calls for adjusted tax credits at the provincial and federal levels to capture more of the taxpaying public.\nOtherwise people are working just to pay off their bills, Saulnier said.\n\"Unless governments address what income level is needed to cover the real costs that people are facing, their income thresholds for those transfers are not helping the people that they should help,\" she said. \"I'm not talking about one-offs, I'm talking about making some permanent changes here.\"\nProvincial Finance Minister Allan MacMaster expressed concern over the report's findings and over the effects of inflation, but he didn't offer specifics on whether the government would implement any tax changes in order to help people to stretch their earnings.\n\"Since we were elected as government, we have focused on targeted supports to focus on those in most need and we will continue to do that,\" MacMaster said following a cabinet meeting Thursday in Halifax. \"We are also trying to invest to fix the health-care system, and that takes a lot of spending.\"\nWith the hourly minimum wage in the province set to hit $15 on Oct. 1, the report also called for the rate to be set at $20.\n\"It's a little too late for $15,\" said Saulnier. \"We've been calling for $15 since we started the reports in 2015 where it would have made a difference.\"\nLabour Minister Jill Balser said the province's minimum wage review committee will be considering the report's findings during deliberations this fall and will be bringing a recommendation to her on the wage rate at the end of the year.\nBalser was noncommittal when asked whether the minimum wage should be $20.\n\"I think it's important that we take a balanced approach to make sure that we have voices heard from all Nova Scotians, and that's businesses as well as workers,\" she said.\nMORE TOP STORIES\nStore manager in Sydney says she's inundated by international students desperate for work\nNo end in sight for midwife shortage in Nova Scotia\nDan Kinsella, chief of Halifax Regional Police, announces retirement\nCape Breton singer-songwriter Bruce Guthro dies at 62\nOn flooded N.S. street, some ask province to consider buying and demolishing houses", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-07T09:57:41.241000", "date_modified": "2023-09-07T17:06:59.313000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

After a review, the mark stood and the Canadian finished seventh in the final behind Fanny Roos, Dongmo, Ealey, Schilder, Ewen and Thomas-Dodd.\n\"That [result] gave her all the confidence in the world to say, 'I can compete against these other girls,'\" said Parkinson. \"Any of these girls can win on any day.

Most non-Indigenous harvesters attempt to avoid detection when [conservation officers are] present, likely out of fear they do not have the same rights asserted by Indigenous harvesters.\"\nBalaclavas, hidden licence plates and midnight violence — why Nova Scotia's baby eel fishery was shut down\nCourt upholds DFO transfer of commercial elver quota to Maritime First Nations\nThat dynamic had consequences, according to the documents.\n\"There is a heightened safety risk when unauthorized harvesters purposefully work in large groups, making it extremely difficult for fishery officers to monitor for compliance and take enforcement action,\" Murray was told on April 14.\n\"There is also an added risk of further escalating the pre-existing tensions by undertaking focused operations to disrupt large groups with additional fishery officers, in particular when Indigenous harvesters are poised to defend what they view to be a treaty right to participate in this fishery. This has factored into the approach taken to date, balancing efforts to monitor both the harvesting and sale of elvers.\"\n'Officers barricaded'\nThe department cited an April 11 incident: \"DFO fishery officers barricaded in at Gold River, N.S., and prevented from leaving for close to one hour. RCMP attended and eventually road opened up.\"\nThe RCMP provided its own version of the incident to CBC this week saying its Lunenburg detachment \"responded to a request for assistance on Beech Hill Road in Gold River First Nation. RCMP officers learned that a peaceful demonstration was ongoing relating to the elver fishery.\n\"In consideration of the RCMP's role of promoting public safety our members attended the scene and monitored the situation. At approximately 8:35 p.m. the demonstration ended peacefully and everyone, including our members, left the area.\"\nDFO cited another incident the following day when 50 Sipekne'katik fishers threatened commercial fishers on the Sissiboo River near Digby.\nPressure to increase Indigenous access\nPrior to the season, Fisheries and Oceans was notified by three Maritime First Nations who did not have DFO approved fishing plans — Sipekne'katik, Millbrook and Elsipogtog — that they were proceeding with their own commercial fishery.\nKwilmu'kw Maw-klusuaqn (KMKNO), the negotiation office for the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaw Chiefs, also told DFO \"a revised elver plan is being provided that will no longer only be the four Kespukwitk communities. It will now include five Unama'ki (Cape Breton) communities and Pictou Landing First Nation which represents over 100 per cent increase in previously authorized community population.\"\nDuring the season fishery officers observed unauthorized harvesters from Eskasoni, Whycocomagh and Listuguj First Nations and received reports of unauthorized harvest from other Maritime First Nations, as well as from the United States.\nMembers of First Nations with approved fishing plans were also seen \"fishing on rivers that are not part of their respective licences, leading to conflicts with other commercial fishing operations.\"\nWhat DFO approved\nIn 2023 DFO approved fishing plans and allocated a 450-kilogram quota shared between four Kespukwitk groups in southern Nova Scotia — Acadia, Bear River,Annapolis Valley and Glooscap.\nSix Wolastoqey First Nations in New Brunswick were allocated 750 kilograms.\nThe quota was 13.7 per cent of the overall total allowable catch and was taken from non-Indigenous commercial licence holders without financial compensation.\nThe minister rejected advice to reduce the commercial quota by 25 per cent in 2023 and transfer it to Indigenous groups.\nThe We'koqma'q First Nation in Cape Breton maintained its long standing commercial quota.\nKMKNO did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\nAcadia, Sipekne'katik and Millbrook also did not respond.\n'Poaching' continued after legal fishery closed\nBoth KMKNO and the Wolastoqey objected to the closure of their previously approved fisheries. The Kespukwitk bands had caught 369 of its 450-kilogram quota when it closed. The New Brunswick bands had netted 111 of their 750-kilogram quota.\nThe closure did not end what the Fisheries minister called \"poaching\" despite hopes it would severely limit \"the opportunity to disguise or launder unauthorized product\" within the legal fishery supply chain.\nThe out-of-control fishing season also affected the East River near Chester, N.S., which is the \"index river\" used by DFO to monitor the health of the elver stock, according to the documents. DFO uses the information to estimate the abundance of the elver population for the entire region and manage conservation.\nIndustry had funded the research for over two decades.\n\"The increase in unauthorized activity in that location is a risk to conducting the planned work to inform science advice on the fishery, thereby contributing to longer term conservation challenges,\" DFO said.\nAfter the shutdown, a non-Indigenous licence holder captured trail camera images of poaching on the East River on 30 different nights and sent the photos to the minister of Fisheries.\nCommercial licence holders\nMichel Samson represents Wine Harbour Fisheries, one of the commercial elver licence holders suing DFO.\n\"What we saw in the spring was clearly known to DFO and should have been predicted and should have been prepared for,\" Samson told CBC News.\nSamson says Wine Harbour has made an unsolicited offer to sell its 1,200-kilogram quota back to the federal government to provide more Indigenous access.\nThe Department of Fisheries abandoned previous negotiations saying licence holders wanted too much money.\n\"The minister can no longer say that all of the proposals were too expensive. There is now an option, and that option is to buy out licence holders and be able to distribute that quota to new First Nations.\"\nWhat happened to industry\nThe Kespukwitk bands were first brought into the commercial fishery in 2022 in an effort to implement moderate livelihood rights.\nTheir quota was taken from the eight commercial licence holders without compensation, triggering a Federal Court lawsuit by commercial licence holders on the grounds it amounted to an unfair expropriation and violated a commitment to buy out existing licence holders when new entrants are brought into a commercial fishery.\nThe 2022 suit was rejected by the Federal Court last week on the grounds DFO was entitled to reallocate quota. But a suit filed when DFO maintained the overall 13.7 per cent cut to non-Indigenous commercial quotas in 2023 remains open.\nOutside perspective\nFisheries consultant and author Rick Williams says the elver fishery is unique: offering huge returns on low effort that is very difficult to police.\nAnd it illustrates the ongoing challenge of integrating moderate livelihood into commercial fisheries while maintaining oversight.\n\"There's a lot to be worked out about how the First Nations and the federal government are going to work together. In this extremely vulnerable fishery that has to happen very quickly if there is going to continue to be a regular commercial fishery and a moderate livelihood fishery in future,\" he says.\n\"The reality that everybody has to live within is that there's a limited amount of fish in the water. And although people do have rights of access to that fish, those rights have to be constrained by conservation requirements.

resigned from his seat on Hanwell council a month and a half after his colleagues voted to suspend him from council for a three-month period over allegations that he spread misinformation about them publicly.", "content": "A months-long saga that has seen a Hanwell councillor have his pay withheld and then get suspended from his position has possibly come to an end with his resignation.\nPat Septon said he resigned Aug. 28 as councillor-at-large for the rural municipality southwest of Fredericton because the series of events that has been difficult for him.\n\"It's been taxing, especially for me and I'm sure others,\" said Septon.\n\"I don't want to take away from the other councillors at all, including the ones perpetrating this. It's tough on everybody and frankly, maybe somebody else is going to have a better chance at succeeding than, than I have.\"\nHanwell Mayor Dave Morrison says he doesn't think Septon 'really understood his role as councillor.'\n \n(Aidan Cox/CBC)\nAccording to Mayor Dave Morrison, conflict that had been brewing between Septon and other councillors and municipal staff since last fall came to a head in December.\nTwenty-six allegations were made that Septon violated the councillors' code of conduct, and an investigation by the municipal clerk deemed 19 to be founded.\nThat led to Septon being sanctioned, which included a reprimand, his remuneration being suspended for six months and a requirement he apologize to the clerk and assistant clerk.\nDespite the sanctions, Morrison said, Septon continued breaching the code of conduct, prompting the community to solicit an independent investigator. Rollie King, a senior adviser with MC Advisory, affiliated with the McInness Cooper law firm, also found Septon breached the code of conduct.\nHanwell councillor suspended for 3 months over accusations of spreading misinformation\nCrosswalk for new Hanwell school would be 'too dangerous,' says mayor\nSome of those breaches centred around statements Septon made on social media regarding the construction of a trail and crosswalk along Route 640 to accommodate students at the recently built Hanwell Park Academy school.\n\"He made unsubstantiated claims such as the RCMP did not want the trail installed,\" wrote the independent investigator, in his report.\n\"He asserted claims that were misleading and could harm the professional reputation of Staff including a statement to the effect that the [chief administrative officer] and another member of Council had no compassion for a child who was struck by a vehicle.\"\nSome of those breaches centred around statements Septon made on social media about the construction of a trail and crosswalk along Route 640 to accommodate students at the recently built Hanwell Park Academy school.\n \n(Hanwell Park Academy/Facebook)\nThis summer, Hanwell councillors voted to amend their code of conduct bylaw to give them powers to suspend a councillor for breaching it, and at a later meeting on July 19, councillors voted 4-2 to suspend Septon for three months.\n\"Pat, I don't think really understood his role as councillor,\" Morrison said.\n\"He kind of [saw] himself as the overseer of council and you know, in Hanwell we've got 7,500 overseers of council, we certainly didn't need another one.\"\nControversy prompts another resignation\nSepton isn't the only councillor resigning from his seat.\nDeborah Peck also quit, as of last month, as councillor for Ward 5, over concerns she had that the ongoing conflict was preventing staff from effectively doing their jobs.\nIt comes less than a year after she was sworn in after winning a byelection for the new seat that represents a ward covering the annexed Kingsclear local service district.\nDeborah Peck says she resigned from Hanwell council because staff were unable to get work done efficiently because of the influx of right to information requests.\n \n(Aidan Cox/CBC)\nPeck said her decision isn't in any way in support of Septon, adding that she filed her letter of resignation before learning he was doing the same.\nShe said the reason she resigned was that she didn't see any end to the conflict on council.\n\"I found that the stress the staff was going through definitely impacted the way councillors could do their work in a timely fashion,\" she said.\nShe said a big challenge to staff was having to process a flurry of requests under the Right to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, which poured in in recent months.\n\"There are so many requests for information ... being submitted to Hanwell. They take a tremendous amount of time.\"\nMorrison said the municipality has fielded at least 15 right to information requests in recent months, some of which have come from Septon, and others from members of the public who he encouraged to do the same.\n\"They're just frivolous and people are just doing it to, you know, tie up time for whatever reasons,\" he said.\n\"It's too bad because, I mean, it hurts the community, it keeps council from moving forward, getting stuff done that we'd like to get done.\"\n3 seats open for byelection\nOn top of the two recent resignations, the council seat for Ward 4 has remained vacant since an earlier resignation last fall.\nThat means three seats will be on the ballot for the Oct. 23 municipal byelection.\n\"I encourage people to put their name out there and and and run for office,\" Morrison said.\n\"But I certainly don't encourage anybody out there that has their own personal agenda.\"", "author":

The summer of 1927 is at the top of the wettest summer list for Halifax, with 687 mm recorded at the old downtown site.\nRecorded rainfall totals in the Halifax area ranged from 555 mm in Eastern Passage to 860 mm in the Hammonds Plains area. \n \n(Ryan Snoddon/CBC)\nThanks to modern day observations, we know that 2023 rainfall totals in the Halifax-Dartmouth area actually ranged between 650 to 740 mm, including Environment Canada's Halifax Windsor Park site (728 mm) and Halifax Kootenay site (740 mm).\nIf we zoom out a little further we see that totals were even higher just to the northwest, where Hammonds Plains recorded 780 to 860 mm of rain, Fall River picked up 812 mm of rain and the Environment Canada Bedford Range site recorded 816 mm.\nSo based on these numbers, can we unofficially say that 2023 was also the wettest modern-day summer in Halifax.\nWhile it probably was, if we had the same number of official and unofficial stations in 1985 and 1927 that we do today, we might also have found some higher totals in those summers as well.\nAgain, it's complicated when it comes to limited weather stations and variable summer rainfall.\nThe bottom line is the summer of 2023 was a cloudy soaker of a summer in the Maritimes and one that we will won't forget any time soon.\nMORE TOP STORIES \nUpdated\nRising rent, food costs driving significant increase in Nova Scotia's living wage\nStore manager in Sydney says she's inundated by international students desperate for work\nNo end in sight for midwife shortage in Nova Scotia\nDan Kinsella, chief of Halifax Regional Police, announces retirement\nOn flooded N.S. street, some ask province to consider buying and demolishing houses", "author": [{"name": "Ryan Snoddon", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/author/ryan-snoddon-1.2985078", "email": "", "about": "Ryan Snoddon is CBC's meteorologist in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.", "metadata": {"title": "Meteorologist"}}], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-07T13:03:16.479000", "date_modified": "2023-09-07T13:03:16.479000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

I have no one else in this world but I was able to stay here,\" Kumar said, gesturing to where the shelter was located. \"Now that it is destroyed, where can I go?\n\"All I need is a place to sleep.\" \nTwo men walk by the site where a homeless shelter used to stand in central New Delhi.\n \n(Salimah Shivji/CBC)\n'Treated like a fly in milk'  \nWorld leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will descend on India's capital for the two-day event, the most high-profile guest list India has ever hosted. \nAhead of the summit, the razing of the shelters and slums left activists feeling disheartened and questioning the methods of Delhi officials. \n\"Who demolishes a shelter home at midnight?\" asked Sunil Kumar Aledia, a longtime Delhi-based social worker with the Centre for Holistic Development.\n\"You cannot demolish someone's home in the name of beautification,\" Aledia told CBC News, adding that the city's homeless population that he serves feels as though they \"are not citizens of this country\" ahead of the G20. \nPeople who are homeless, Aledia said, \"are treated like a fly in milk and thrown away. They have no value.\"  \nIshant Kumar, 10, stands next to his bulldozed house during a demolition drive by authorities at a slum area near the upcoming G20 summit venue in New Delhi on June 1.\n \n(Adnan Abidi/Reuters)\nThe Indian government has denied the charge, saying the settlements were built illegally and their removal was ongoing and not linked to the upcoming summit. \nAfter a string of demolitions in the Delhi area this spring, a minister responsible for housing in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government told India's parliament in July that 93 hectares of government land had been reclaimed, adding that no houses were destroyed to make the city presentable for the G20 summit. \nBillboards across the country \nAfter India took over as host of the G20 in December of last year, a massive advertising campaign lurched into gear alongside beautification efforts, with billboards appearing across the country. More than 200 G20-linked meetings were held in cities all over India, often with great fanfare.\nIndian officials have looked at the G20 \"not as an event. They're looking at it as a sort of national celebration,\" said Indrani Bagchi, head of the Ananta Aspen Centre, a New Delhi-based think-tank.\n\"It's putting global concerns in the minds of Indians.\"\nBagchi said that it's important for the Modi government that the summit goes off without a hitch to show both a domestic and global audience \"that we can do something on this scale.\" \nWATCH | Slum demolished ahead of G20 meeting in New Delhi:\n \nNew Delhi slum destroyed in May ahead of G20 summit\n2 days ago\nDuration \n0:50\nTemporary houses made of tin sheets in Janta Camp were demolished in May, ahead of September's geopolitical summit in India's capital.\nThe messaging from government officials has been consistent: that its G20 presidency confirms that India is now a major player and power broker on the world stage, as the fifth-largest economy and growing quickly. \nIndia has used the platform to position itself as the leader of the global south, Bagchi said, highlighting issues important to developing countries and lobbying to extend G20 membership to the African Union. \nPromoting national pride \nThe G20 publicity campaign is as much a domestic one as a global one, with officials taking the opportunity to promote national pride as the country hosts foreign dignitaries. One state-issued dinner invitation referred to the \"president of Bharat\" instead of \"India,\" fuelling speculation the Modi government will move to get rid of the country's English name, a vestige of British rule.\nWhy India's ruling government might be pushing to change the country's name\nBharat, a Sanskrit term that can be traced back to ancient Hindu scriptures, is already one of the two official names of the country enshrined in the constitution. It is also a term the prime minister uses often in his speeches, preferring it to India.\nElsewhere, in preparation for the large-scale G20 summit, statues and fountains have been built and potted plants installed on New Delhi's streets. \nSunil Kumar Aledia, a longtime New Delhi-based social worker, wonders 'who demolishes a shelter home at midnight?'\n \n(Salimah Shivji/CBC)\nSeveral screens have been set up and now hide shanty dwellings that are on the routes where delegates might pass to reach the city's newly built convention centre. \nDuring the two-day event, dozens of people will also be standing outside Delhi's venues, mimicking the sounds of langur monkeys to keep the pesky animals that normally roam freely around the city away from high-profile guests. \nTens of thousands of police officers and security personnel will be stationed around the capital, with many having recently gone through training simulating responses to various high-risk scenarios, such as hostage-takings or building takeovers. \nGlaring absences \nBut Modi's geopolitical ambitions tied to the summit may be tarnished by the deepening divides among the world's most powerful countries that make up the G20, with consensus unlikely over the Russia-Ukraine war. \nBoth Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are skipping the event. It will be the first time Xi, or any president of China, will miss the G20, in what many see as a snub to India, given the border tensions and chilly relations between the neighbouring countries.\nIndia's foreign minister, S. Jaishankar, said in an interview with local news agency ANI that the absences have \"nothing to do with India.\" \nBagchi said Indian officials tried to persuade Xi to attend, but ultimately, China's absence at the table is not a surprise. \n\"In the past year, we've seen Chinese officials opposing all consensus,\" Bagchi told CBC in an interview, highlighting that none of the high-level ministerial G20 meetings so far this year have resulted in a joint communique, a key document every summit strives for. \nIndrani Bagchi, head of the Ananta Aspen Centre, a New Delhi-based think-tank, says Indian officials are looking at the G20 summit 'as a sort of national celebration.'\n \n(Salimah Shivji/CBC)\nAnd that could very well be the same outcome at the leaders' summit this weekend — for the first time since the G20 began meeting in 1999. \nThe Indian side, Bagchi said, is \"not unaware that China wants to snub India or to hold it down or keep it off balance.\" \nBut the geopolitical wrangling or perceived snubs between countries mean nothing for those who are left without a place to sleep as Delhi hosts the G20. \nWar in Ukraine expected to block consensus at G20 as Trudeau visits Asia\nTrudeau 'disappointed' Ukraine not invited to G20, vows to bring Kyiv's concerns to the table\n\"These are the people who make a city,\" said Aledia, gesturing to a group of homeless men gathered around him under New Delhi's punishing midday sun.\n\"It is not possible to develop for G20 without them,\" he said. \"They are back to zero, left with nothing.\"  \nThe loss of the central Delhi homeless shelter, which activists say was demolished as part of a beautification campaign ahead of the G20 leaders' summit, has hit many hard, leaving them with few options aside from sleeping on the streets. \n \n(Salimah Shivji/CBC)", "author": [{"name": "Salimah Shivji", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/author/salimah-shivji-1.2559561", "email": "", "about": "Salimah Shivji is CBC's South Asia correspondent, based in Mumbai.

According to the Association of Atlantic Universities (AAU), every university in Halifax is looking to expand student housing. \nNova Scotia Community College (NSCC) is the furthest along, with construction already underway for about 350 new units across three of its campuses, but other schools are still in the early stages of planning and, perhaps most crucially, fundraising.\nLahey said the size of the new build at King's will be determined, in part, by how much money can be raised. The project could cost anywhere from $40 million to $80 million. Help from the provincial and federal governments will be needed, he said.\nThe province has given $112 million to the NSCC housing projects. Advanced Education Minister Brian Wong said further plans for addressing the student housing shortage are coming, though he did not provide any details.\nWong's department was supposed to release a student housing strategy this past spring, but he told reporters this week it remains incomplete.\nBrian Wong is Nova Scotia's minister of advanced education.\n \n(CBC)\n\"The plan is still being worked on, we want to put our final touches on it,\" said Wong. \"But … whatever comes out in the plan, isn't going to make things happen any faster.

A warden has a similar position to a mayor, but is elected by their fellow councillors instead of by the voters.\nThe UARB does not have jurisdiction over the warden versus mayor debate, so that will not be changed through the boundary review process.\nSteve Raftery lives in Bridgetown, which is part of the Municipality of the County of Annapolis.\n \n(Steve Raftery)\nThe county's UARB application details how the survey, done last year, saw a turnout of about 400 responses, which municipal staff said was one of their highest engagements ever.\nThe winning choice with about 29 per cent (114 votes) was six districts and a mayor, with the second-highest votes (67) coming in for a mayor system with eight districts.\nBut councillors have raised concerns about the validity of that survey both during county meetings and within the UARB application. They said there was a low voter turnout with 400 responses registered, or about two per cent of the county's roughly 18,800 population. And some IP addresses, used to identify individual computers, entered multiple responses.\nRaftery said it's unclear whether those responses could have come from computers in a public library, but with only 19 responses at most from one IP address it does not seem like a deliberate hacking attempt.\nEvery municipality has been going through this review process which is done every eight years to ensure the number of electors eligible to vote in each district is balanced.\nHalifax boundary changes renew calls to allow permanent residents to vote\nProposed Halifax boundary changes would reunite Black neighbourhoods\nMaria Hagen was one of the three residents, including Raftery, who urged the UARB to order Annapolis County to reduce its districts on Wednesday.\n\"If the survey was faulty, if it was not well-advertised — which in my opinion I don't think it was — then take the time to do it again,\" Hagen told the hearing.\nShe and Raftery pointed out the neighbouring Municipality of the County of Kings only has nine councillors and a mayor while serving a population of about 48,700 — more than double Annapolis County.\nThe UARB \ndecision for Kings County's\n review said each of its nine councillors is responsible for 4,264 electors. In Annapolis, the 11 councillors each have an average of 1,383 electors.\nComparing counties is not helpful: warden\nCurrently, Annapolis councillors make just under $34,000 a year for a role that is considered part-time, with the warden making about double that. Hagen said even cutting back to nine councillors would save the municipality tens of thousands of dollars.\nBut Warden of Annapolis County, Alex Morrison, said it's possible that there wouldn't be much savings with increased expenses from councillors keeping up with committee work or having to burn more gas driving across larger districts.\n\"Sometimes ... local conditions are different and it's hard to compare one county to another because various criteria change,\" Morrison said Thursday.\nHe pointed out that since the former Town of Bridgetown and its five-person council were dissolved in 2015 and absorbed into the county, there are now fewer councillors for Annapolis overall.\nAlex Morrison is warden of the Municipality of the County of Annapolis.\n \n(CBC)\nWhen it comes to the survey, Morrison said the opinions of the people who voted \"do matter\" and were taken into consideration, but the council members made what they felt was the best decision for the entire county.\nBut earlier this year, Coun. Mike Gunn voted against the county's decision to keep the status quo.\n\"I know the turnout may be low, but I believe that's the will of the people,\" Gunn said Thursday.\nAs the councillor for Upper Clements, Gunn said it's the largest district in the county and takes him an hour to cross —but said adding more residents to his area wouldn't make his job unbearable.\nGunn said since the province has taken up many responsibilities rural municipalities used to handle, like schools and waste, the job is \"much less than it used to be.\"\nRichard Melanson, the UARB member leading the hearing, said he hopes to deliver a decision on the county's application before the end of the month.\nMORE TOP STORIES\n \nNova Scotia plans to increase fine for buying out-of-season lobster to $1 million\nN.S. minister says international students need to take responsibility for finding housing, jobs\nInside the failed Maritime elver fishery: documents describe confrontation, risk to safety\nDocuments show Nova Scotians urging minister to proclaim Coastal Protection Act\nWeather\nSummer of 2023 was the wettest on record for much of the Maritimes", "author": [{"name": "Haley Ryan", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/author/haley-ryan-1.5457142", "email": "haley.ryan@cbc.ca", "about": "Haley Ryan is the municipal affairs reporter for CBC covering mainland Nova Scotia.

It could have been worse,\" he said. \"You could have [gone] on and something could have catastrophically failed. And that's devastating.\"\n'Just shocked' \nAs images of the structural flaws discovered inside the building were projected across the room, owners heard the details of why their homes are unsafe. Many asked questions about who was involved in construction and how the structural flaws were overlooked. \nCastledowns Pointe was built in 1999. Lisa Brown, who has owned a unit in the building since 2008, said she can't fathom how the design flaws went unnoticed through the construction process.\nNear cracks that had formed in the hall outside her unit, engineers opened up the drywall to discover bowing trusses and flawed framing.\n\"I was just shocked to see what was behind the wall because there is no explanation, there is no craftsmanship,\" Brown said.\n\"There is literally nothing that can explain what was found in the framing, which then brings up why did the City of Edmonton pass this? Because they had to have passed this.\" \nUpdated\nResidents of Edmonton condo building ordered out over concerns of collapse\nIn a statement to CBC, a city spokesperson said \"no concerns were noted\" during the final inspection on the building in November 2000.\nCastledowns Pointe's property manager, Simco Management, said the condo board has retained legal counsel and is exploring litigation against the parties involved in the construction process.\nBrown said she expects she and other owners will have little legal recourse. She fears for the financial hardships ahead, with condo fees and mortgage payments still due.\n\"Sometimes having more information is hard because you know what's going to come, and the hardship that's going to come with it,\" she said. \n\"If we have to rebuild this building, and it would cost millions of dollars, we are on the hook.\n\"We are not people of a lot of means, so there are going to be a lot of people who are going to suffer with this.\"\nOwners and tenants received notice Sept. 1 that their homes were at risk of collapse. The condo board urged residents to pack a bag and vacate the building immediately. A formal evacuation order from the city followed on Tuesday. \nStructural engineering firm Read Jones Christoffersen Ltd. determined the building's construction did not match the original architectural and structural designs — and that it is under-designed to carry the structural load.\nThe firm's investigation discovered incomplete framing that was beginning to twist and crack, as well as bowing walls, incomplete foundations and dangerously weak trusses inside the walls. \nMurphy, the engineer who spoke at Wednesday's meeting, said making the building safe will be difficult and costly as each of the problem spots would need to be exposed before repairs could be made. \nLisa Brown has owned a unit in the Castledowns Pointe condo building since 2008. She worries about the financial hardships ahead for her and other owners.\n \n(Mrinal Anchan/CBC)\nThe City of Edmonton said a building permit for the project was issued in August 1999. \nThe city declined to provide CBC a copy of the inspection report but detailed how the process usually works.\nSpokesperson Mary-Ann Thurber said the building code required the involvement of professional architects and engineers who were responsible for design and construction.\n\"The city does not specifically or necessarily inspect the structural components of large buildings which employ professional involvement,\" she said. \n\"Passing the final building/occupancy inspection marks the end of the building safety codes process.\"\nThurber said that for certain buildings, follow-up inspections may be carried out by fire safety code inspectors, or be done if a building falls into disrepair.\nRobert Noce, an Edmonton-based lawyer who specializes in condominiums, said owners will need to decide if the building is worth saving, and if they want to pursue what would likely be a costly, protracted legal battle.\n\"This is an absolutely tragic situation,\" Noce said Thursday.\n\"There are a lot of questions that need to be answered in terms of a budget, timing and whether or not the corporation even has a chance of winning and being successful in getting a judgment.\"\nHugh Willis, a lawyer with Willis Law hired by the condo corporation, said all legal options are being explored as his firm begins to investigate the construction process in detail.\nCases like this are incredibly challenging to litigate, especially two decades after construction, he said. They will need to identify every party involved in the project and determine where critical safeguards in the inspection process may have failed.\nBut for now the focus is on ensuring that displaced owners can retrieve their belongings and be better prepared for the hard decisions ahead, he said.\n\"The personal toll this takes on the individuals is significant,\" Willis said. \n\"Whenever we have a catastrophe, getting the group together in a room in the immediate aftermath is absolutely critical.

supports\n21 hours ago\nDuration \n2:23\nFive First Nations communities in northern Alberta have declared a regional state of emergency due to an ongoing mental health and addictions crisis.\nThe ATC said community members don't want to travel hundreds of kilometres away for help, as residential schools once forced them to do, leaving them even more vulnerable. \n\"We're seeing a significant rise in violence and illegal activities by people coming from outside our region and preying upon those experiencing crisis who are desperate for some relief,\" said Karla Buffalo, CEO of the Athabasca Tribal Council. \nMeanwhile, said Adam, drug-related violence just adds to the trauma.\n\"People are scared because drug dealers are shooting at each other, and they're doing it right in broad daylight when kids are around.\"\nIn April, toxic drugs killed 182 people in Alberta, the most deaths in a month since 2016, according to provincial statistics.\nThe Confederacy of Treaty 6 First Nations declared its own state of emergency in July backed by figures showing Indigenous people are seven times more likely to die of opioid toxicity than non-Indigenous Albertans.\nPlans by the ATC to declare an emergency in June were sidelined by encroaching wildfires that forced chiefs to focus on protecting and evacuating communities.\nOn Thursday, Treaty 8 Grand Chief Arthur Noskey told governments to step up to address the mental health and addiction crisis rooted in unhealed trauma from colonization, residential schools and the suppression of cultural practices.\nMany community members continue to struggle, he said, due to the lack of local, cultural, relevant and safe resources.\n\"So I challenge you and encourage you as a collective, let's work together … for them to see that there is help here.\"\nThe Athabasca Tribal Council addresses questions from concerned community members.\n \n(Submitted by Athabasca Tribal Council)\nThe ATC task force includes community members, health-care professionals, emergency management officials and RCMP.\nAdams said leaders have met with Indigenous Services Canada and thanked the provincial government and Sandy Bowman, mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, for their support.\nIn a statement to CBC News, Zeus Eden, press secretary, Office of the Minister of Indigenous Services, said the federal government shares the concerns of the ATC and is committed to working with all partners to support community-led solutions.\nEden said the minister has met with Adam, and that Indigenous Services Canada officials meet regularly with the ATC and other partners to discuss mental health and wellness supports.\nHe said that an ISC crisis response team has been deployed in the area since April and the ISC has provided more than $5.8 million to support Indigenous mental health services in the Wood Buffalo region of Alberta.\n\"We will continue to work with the Athabasca Tribal Council and all communities in the Wood Buffalo area to offer services that are culturally-appropriate and self-determined,\" said Eden.\nIn an emailed statement, the provincial government expressed its sympathy to families, friends and communities who have lost loved ones to addiction.\n\"We have been committed since day one to working with Indigenous partners to address the issue of addiction in their

And he was compelled, for some reason, to demonstrate that to the world over and over and over again, and that's what the circles were.\"\nGuthro transcended genres — from rock to traditional — and marched to the beat of his own drum, said Cormier, forging his own path in a cutthroat industry through his ability to connect with people and brush off negativity.\nMainstreet NS\n17:53\nRemembering Cape Breton singer-songwriter Bruce Guthro\nBruce Guthro, one of Cape Breton's most well-known troubadours whose remarkable 40-year career made waves on both sides of the Atlantic, died on Tuesday evening after a battle with cancer. We hear from Bill MacNeil, one of Guthro's co-producers, and fellow musicians Kim Dunn, Matt Minglewood and Sam Moon.\nIn his early days, even as he was signed to a major label and rose to number 1 in the Canadian charts with \nWalk This Road\n, Guthro always avoided the \"troublemakers\" of the business and floated above adversity, said Cormier.\n\"He was very smart. He knew people. He knew more about people than most guys I've met,\" said Cormier, who has himself sat in Guthro's circle more times than he can count.\n\"He loved people and so his success was unavoidable.\"\nFor fellow Cape Breton songwriter Gordie Sampson, Guthro was the Yoda of performance — \"He just had the force.\"\n\"He could work the crowd and he knew it, and there was absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. That's what entertainment is,\" said Sampson. \"He was able to read his audience.... He lived and fed off the crowd, and it was so innate.\"\nGuthro started from humble beginnings, growing up in the small coal mining community of Sydney Mines. He was the seventh of nine children.\nSheumas MacNeil, one part of the Cape Breton family band the Barra MacNeils, recalled playing with Guthro at the local beverage room in their teen years and then returning to the MacNeil homestead to continue the revelry until the wee hours. \n\"On the weekends, we would gather in the woods around a fire and sing songs, and actually a lot of famous singers from Sydney Mines gathered around that fire with Bruce,\" said MacNeil, joking that perhaps the \"Brown Street Country Club\" campfire jams were the origin of his songwriters' circles.\nIn the late 1990s, a Celtic band from Scotland called Runrig was looking for a new lead singer. Enter Guthro, who held the band's main microphone and helped fill European stadiums until their final performance in 2018, which drew more than 50,000 people.\nFormer Runrig bandmate Pete Wishart described Guthro as \"the nicest person you could ever hope to meet, and a joy to perform with.\"\n\"An exceptional singer, musician and songwriter taken far too soon. We are going to miss him,\" Wishart said in a social media post.\nWatch as Bruce Guthro plays guitar with his young son in 1998\n2 days ago\nDuration \n1:12\nBruce Guthro's son Dylan Guthro, then seven years old, accompanied him on guitar for the song Walk This Road.\nDespite his success on the world stage, Guthro's loyalty to his home province was unwavering, hosting his songswriters' circle in Halifax multiple times a year and becoming a mainstay act at the annual Stan Rogers Folk Festival in Canso, N.S.\nHis legacy will also live on through his children, who themselves have established their own place in the music industry — Dylan Guthro is a songwriter and producer currently based in Nashville and Jodi Guthro is a singer-songwriter in her own right.\n'He'll never die'\nA few weeks before his death, Guthro posted a video on his Facebook page, a stand-in for his would-be performance at the Canso folk festival.\nFlanked by his children around a kitchen table with a drink in his hand, Guthro asked for prayers from his fans before launching into a newly written song that includes the line, \"Can I get an amen?\"\nHe appears composed as he recites the Lord's Prayer while Jodi and Dylan harmonize the song's main passage.\n\"Thank you all for your support over the years in this blessed musical career I've had. You were always the inspiration behind it all,\" Guthro wrote in the post.\nCormier said Guthro's death will leave a noticeable void in Nova Scotia's music scene, but he promised to help carry on his renowned songwriters' circles in some way.\n\"Our little world here just got smaller. But like I said, if we remember what he did, and we continue what he did, he'll never die.\"\nAfter battling cancer, singer-songwriter Bruce Guthro dies at 62\n2 days ago\nDuration \n2:25\nBruce Guthro, one of Cape Breton's most well-known troubadours whose remarkable 40-year career made waves on both sides of the Atlantic, has died.

Most of that increase was driven by mental health calls, said Charlottetown Police Chief Brad MacConnell.\n\"I'm going to be challenging myself and my staff to do more with the resources we have because I know our community needs us,\" MacConnell said.\n\"Drug addiction largely is a coping mechanism for deep-rooted mental health issues, people suffering anxiety or stresses of being homeless.\"\n'Zero tolerance'\nMacConnell outlined some of the immediate changes he has ordered.\nCharlottetown police will be more visible in the city, with more foot patrols and a focus on senior and student safety.\nMany complaints at the meeting focused on the Community Outreach Centre.\n \n(Kevin Yarr/CBC)\n\"I've instructed my staff to have a zero tolerance for people trespassing on private property,\" said MacConnell, but he acknowledged police face difficulties.\n\"One of the challenges with that commitment is we can issue the fines and bring people before the court, but we have also heard stories of people being back in the community after being charged. And that's challenging because it undermines people's confidence in the police force.\"\nA further challenge facing police is that in 2020, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada asked all federal lawyers to avoid prosecuting \nsimple drug possession\n cases unless there are major public safety concerns, MacConnell said.\nTommy Ford says he wants to see the Community Outreach Centre shut down.\n \n(Tony Davis/CBC)\nMany at the meeting warned police that community members are prepared to take matters into their own hands.\nCharlottetown resident Tommy Ford is one of those who thinks the outreach centre needs to go.\n\"Stop enabling them and shut down the program,\" Ford said.\nFord believes a solution starts with federal government policies, and he said he wants to see representatives of the federal government at public meetings surrounding drug use in the city.\n'I think fundamentally to solve the drug-related problem is to have drug-related services that actually serve the addicted public,' says Dane Cutcliffe.\n \n(Tony Davis/CBC)\nCharlottetown resident and business owner Dane Cutcliffe said rather than cutting back, programs need to be expanded and adapted so that people dealing with addiction can get the treatment they need more quickly.\n\"Fundamentally, to solve the drug-related problem is to have drug-related services that actually serve the addicted public, and working toward programming that really helps those people rather than enable them with services that provide paraphernalia,\" he said.\nPeople close to Cutcliffe have told him they have tried to get into a treatment facility but sometimes have to wait up to a week to access services, he said.\nTensions rise in Charlottetown neighbourhood after serious assault, issues at seniors' housing\n'People not feeling safe' around Charlottetown Outreach Centre, says MLA\n\"If they can go back to using a drug in the meantime, often by the time they get called, they don't even want the help anymore,\" Cutcliffee said, adding he's concerned people could get clean needles from the outreach centre and source drugs close by.\nSeveral were critical of harm reduction supplies being given out at the outreach centre, but MacConnell said cutting off access to clean needles or taking drugs away could cause health issues for the person facing addiction.\n\"Taking drugs off people that are addicted to them can cause people to become very desperate and dangerous,\" he said.\nHow a safer site to use drugs fits into P.E.I.'s addiction strategy\nOutreach centre would be better fit in different location, says person who oversees it\nWhile police have a large role to play in controlling illicit drug use, said MacConnell, it isn't something police can solve alone.\n\"As a police chief I can't provide housing, I can't provide long-term mental health support, I cannot provide addiction support,\" he said.\n\"We can try to keep people safe and make people feel safe in their homes and neighbourhoods, but again that is challenging and we will need support from all levels of government.\"\n'How you talk about them is sickening'\nNot everyone at the meeting wanted to see the Community Outreach Centre shut down.\n'What I have heard this evening is that you don't consider the most vulnerable people in our community of Charlottetown members of our community,' says Daniel Cousins.\n \n(Submitted)\nDaniel Cousins said they are worried Charlottetown's most vulnerable people are not being considered.\n\"What I have heard this evening is that you don't consider the most vulnerable people in our community of Charlottetown members of our community.

And sometimes other traffic, seeing the lights flashing and somebody pulled over, certainly acts as a deterrent.\"\nThe number of tickets being written is up, said MacFarlane, but more importantly the number of complaints about speeding drivers is down.\nBetween January and the end of July, tickets are up more than 70 per cent, with almost 1,000 tickets issued.

It also wants the REM to plan, as soon as possible, a presentation to residents focused on the sections located beyond the Ruisseau station.\n Emmanuelle Rouillard-Moreau, a spokesperson for CDPQ Infra, says the company is sensitive to the situation of local residents and takes the issue of REM noise seriously.\nDuring the REM design phase, noise modelling was carried out and then presented in 2021. The noise barrier planned for Saint-Laurent has not changed since 2020, she said.\n\"In the event of significant impacts, mitigation measures were developed and presented during the same period,\" she said in an email.\n\"Finally, we will follow up on this issue and implement a noise monitoring program as part of REM's operational phase.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-07T04:00:00.981000", "date_modified": "2023-09-07T04:00:00.981000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

But she didn't find the archives until much later.\n\"We hear about Sappho, Gertrude Stein, all these famous artists and writers, but what about ordinary lesbians in Quebec? Who were they, how did they live?\" said Neuville.\n\"When you're\n madame tout le monde\n it's not always simple.\"\nLaure Neuville, an archivist at the Lesbian Archives of Quebec, holds up the lesbian magazine Treize. She was once the publication's editor-in-chief.\n \n(Erika Morris/CBC)\nShedding light on hidden history\nArchivists spend hours upon hours searching for traces of lesbian history through coded language or hidden stories in old documents. Many stories about homosexuality still aren't indexed as such, like a wedding between two women in 1942.\nWomen passed themselves off as men during the Second World War to work in factories and earn a man's wage — which was much higher than a woman's — and in Sainte-Thérèse, Que., one such woman got married to another female colleague.\nSix months after the wedding, her wife came out publicly and denounced their marriage as a sham, exposing her \"husband\" as a woman, who was then pursued in court for identity fraud.\n\"We aren't sure how the story ended. There aren't archives of the verdict,\" said Neuville.\nThe Lesbian Archives of Quebec's original indexes are Neuville's favourite to look through.\n \n(Erika Morris/CBC)\n\"All the big newspapers like La Presse were reporting on it at the time, but it was never written 'two lesbians' or 'lesbian wedding in Sainte-Thérèse in 1942.' When you're doing research, you have to look at all the newspapers of that year and happen to stumble on the stories.\"\nWomen's history has long been suppressed, said Neuville, even more so for those marginalized like racialized, working-class and queer women. She said the first real studies of women's history started in the 1960s, and gender studies only started being seen as a legitimate field in universities in the 1990s.\nNeuville pointed out that it was once very difficult to live as an independent woman. They couldn't \nhave their own bank account\n or sign a lease until the '60s — nevermind live with another woman when homosexuality was criminalized.\nEven in feminist movements, lesbians often stayed in the closet as their sexuality was seen as a threat to the movement's image, said Neuville, making it hard to track them.\n\"There were others before us and they succeeded in conditions that are more complicated than ours to survive and create a community, be in a couple, start a family even,\" said Neuville.\n\"It helps us find our identity but it also helps us reflect on our current struggle and strategies for queer liberation.\"\nFrom basement to basement\nThe lesbian archives got their start at La Kahéna restaurant in 1983, when the women running it started collecting documents. They later moved to the Gilford School.\nBut when the school was turned into a co-op in the '90s, the archives were kept in various lesbians' homes.\nThey were dormant until the Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre gave them a room — \"more like a closet,\" said Neuville — to keep the boxes.\n\"This is pretty typical for queer archives,\" said Julie Podmore, an LGBT researcher who sits on the archives' board of directors.\nFor one, it's often difficult to find institutional space and secure funding for an archive, she said.\n\"And then there's that tension, of course, with not wanting to give it over to institutions like universities or libraries and to keep it within the community,\" said Podmore.\nLesbians held picnics at Jeanne-Mance Park every Sunday and advertised them by putting up posters with maps around the city.\n \n(Submitted by the Lesbian Archives of Quebec)\nThe Lesbian Archives of Quebec have a lot of typical archival materials like posters, news clippings, old magazines and videos but also unconventional items like clothes, banners, buttons and other cultural artifacts.\nAlmost every copy of the Quebec lesbian magazine Treize — of which Neuville was once editor-in-chief — are kept in neatly labelled boxes, along with other publications and scrapbooks full of posters.\nLast spring, the archives moved to the Cité-des-Hospitalières monastery right by Jeanne-Mance Park.\n\"It's funny to be near Jeanne-Mance Park, considering its history,\" said Neuville.\nMany lesbians lived in the Plateau-Mont-Royal area in the '80s — where the city's first lesbian bars opened, all of which have since closed — and would have picnics at the park every Sunday.\nPosters would be pasted around the city that included a small map to find the group that would gather under a banner for the \ncercle des vieilles filles\n (spinsters' circle).\nLesbians held picnics at Jeanne-Mance Park every Sunday under the Cercle des vieilles filles banner.\n \n(Submitted by the Lesbian Archives of Quebec)\nPassing on knowledge\nNow that the archives have found a proper home, Podmore said the collective wants to work on more community initiatives. It now offers internships for library and archiving students and welcomes researchers, for example.\n\"That's what we really want to do, because I think community-based archives need a community to support them and to make them relevant,\" said Podmore.\nNeuville and volunteers are working on indexing and digitizing the archives — though most won't go online due to copyright and privacy concerns.\nThey also hope to incorporate the archives, develop protocols to acquire new material and continue receiving operating grants.\nNeatly labelled boxes hold hundreds of Quebec lesbian magazines and zines.\n \n(Erika Morris/CBC)\nNeuville and Podmore want the next generation of queer people who identify with the lesbian experience to have access to these historical materials, feel connected to those who came before them and maintain a continuity of activism in the community.\n\"Queer history is not mainstream.… We don't know stories about things like \nSex Garage\n or the Gilford School. And that's because, of course, queer history has been marginalized from mainstream history, like a lot of other histories,\" said Podmore.\nNeuville agrees.\n\"I would like for younger lesbians to not have to reinvent the wheel with every generation.… That's not to say that we shouldn't keep reflecting and evolving with time, but there's something important in not starting at square one,\" she said.", "author": [{"name": "Erika Morris", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/author/erika-morris-1.6201667", "email": "", "about": "Erika Morris is a journalist at CBC Montreal.", "metadata": {"title": "CBC News journalist"}}], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-07T04:00:00.663000", "date_modified": "2023-09-07T04:00:00.663000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The borough mayor, Laurence Lavigne Lalonde, suggested Khan go first since she had a young child who would need to go to bed shortly. \nKhan's question about what she and her husband will do with their two vehicles — a small car and a van — once the parking spaces would be lost launched a series of shouts in her favour that prompted Lavigne Lalonde to request that some attendees be escorted out.\nStella Bailakis, a longtime resident who works for several community organizations and seems to know everyone in the area, was among those asked to leave after she compared the mayor to Maurice Duplessis, a Quebec premier in the 1940s and 1950s known for his authoritarian streak. \nA crowd gathered outside after a borough council meeting in Parc-Extension grew rowdy over a debate about parking spaces and bike lanes Tuesday night.\n \n(Verity Stevenson/CBC)\n\"When you're doing a project like the bike lane, have a compromise in mind,\" Bailakis said in an interview outside. \"Why do the old people, kids, families get booted out [of the conversation] just to please one people: the bike people?\" \nSimilar arguments have been made on the other side. But while there have been debates over parking and bike lanes in several other boroughs across the city, Park Ex residents say their gripes go beyond parking and are also about feeling underrepresented in a borough that encompasses three vastly different neighbourhoods in an era of rapid change. \nFrench-language stickers on Park Ex sidewalks miss the mark, locals say\n\"As soon as we cross the tracks to Villeray,\" Bailakis said, \"everything's pretty; there are flower boxes everywhere … everything's taken care of.\" Garbage has been another \nbig issue\n in Park Ex in recent years, she added. \nBike lanes take up 2 per cent\nIn response to another resident's parking concerns at the council meeting, Lavigne Lalonde said 50 per cent of Park Ex's population doesn't use a car and that bike lanes occupy only two per cent of the borough's roadways; three per cent is for public transit and 20 per cent is for pedestrians. \n\"The rest is for cars. So, when people come and tell me we're putting [bike lanes] everywhere — I'm sorry, but at the moment it's two per cent,\" the borough mayor replied. According to one environmental advocacy group, parking takes up 29.8 per cent of the space in Park Ex. \nThere are currently two bike lanes on either side of Querbes Avenue separated from parked and rolling cars only by faded painted lines on the pavement. Work to revamp them is expected to last from mid- to late-September and will move the lanes next to the sidewalks and create a physical barrier between them and cars.\nThe added barriers mean the city must remove a lane of parking on the eastern side of Querbes from Ogilvy Avenue to Crémazie Boulevard, as well as on a part of Ball Avenue, Lavigne Lalonde said in an interview with CBC Wednesday.\nThe mayor says it was her responsibility to make sure people commuting without cars can get around safely and that Park Ex lacks safe cycling infrastructure. Home-care workers will be given parking stickers that will grant them priority to park on the street. \nLaurence Lavigne Lalonde is the borough mayor for Villeray-Saint-Michel-Parc-Extension.\n \n(Verity Stevenson/CBC)\nBut residents like Khan say they feel pushed aside. \nWhen Khan asked her question, Lavigne Lalonde replied that her administration had made the decision to revamp the bike lanes and remove parking spots, knowing it would affect people's lives.\nKhan felt she was being told to change her lifestyle, which involves a constant series of appointments and errands to keep the family of six afloat. Her husband has a one-hour commute to the South Shore every day to the fertilizer manufacturing company he works for. \nWednesday afternoon, Khan had just returned from a doctor's appointment on foot with her three-year-old's stroller packed with groceries when she was met by two CBC reporters outside her house. \n\"I felt like I had no voice. I felt like I just wasted two hours of my time without being heard,\" she said of the meeting. \nLavigne Lalonde said she didn't have a chance to fully respond, given the shouting.\n'Who is going to help her?'\nA few doors down, Matilda Ramacieri's reserved disability parking space will be moved around the block to D'Anvers Avenue as a result of the bike lane changes. \nMatilda Ramacieri obtained a parking spot reserved for people with disabilities after she lost mobility following three major operations in recent years. The borough is moving her spot around the corner. \n \n(Verity Stevenson/CBC)\nRamacieri, 66, has been off work as a crossing guard in the neighbourhood for three years following three major operations to her hip, shoulder and knee. She struggles to walk more than 15 metres, she said. \n\"What am I supposed to do in the winter? It's going to be difficult,\" said Ramacieri, who was born in the building she now owns. Her parents first rented it when they moved to Canada from Italy. \nHer 24-year-old son, Marco Paredes-Ramacieri, went to borough council Tuesday evening but was turned away because of overcrowding. \n\"If I'm not there to remove the snow from her car and she falls in the street or something, who is going to help her?\" he said. \nParedes-Ramacieri was among a couple dozen people outside the borough office on Ogilvy Avenue late Tuesday night. Seven police cars were parked on the street, though Montreal police said they made no arrests and were there simply to make sure things remained calm.\nBenefits outweigh costs: advocate\nBlaise Rémillard, who oversees transportation and urbanization initiatives for the environmental advocacy organization CRE-Montreal, said he understands why the loss of parking spaces in Park Ex is a sensitive topic. \nPlan to replace curbside parking with bike paths in NDG pushes forward despite citizen protests\nMontreal could save $500M a year by nixing free parking, environmental group says\n\"I think there's a cumulative effect in neighbourhoods with more marginalized populations,\" Rémillard said.

There's no shortage of stuff to talk about when you have hours of a morning show, but some of those things are so tough.\nHB:\n Absolutely.

And it, I think, moulded the way that I covered the story in the future in that I really got a sense of what it was like to be a vulnerable person in that situation.\nThere were about 800 people in line waiting seven or eight hours, many times without food or water and with children and babies and people in wheelchairs. It was a way that I had never seen my city before. And it was absolutely heartbreaking. \nI had to take my journalism hat off and become a member of the community first.

As a kid, Montique said he wasn't aware of the family's immigration status or its precarity.\n\"I was at a young age ... I didn't know anything that was really going on,\" he said. \nFamily allowed to stay in Canada\nBy 2019, his parents and siblings applied for permanent residency as a family under humanitarian and compassionate grounds, which is a type of application that examines how settled someone is in Canada, their family ties in the country and the best interests of any children involved. \nThe Montique family used an immigration application counselor, who Montique said advised him not to apply as part of his family's application. That might have been due to him being in his mid-20s and no longer considered a dependent, he said, although he's not sure as he feels the counselor didn't properly explain the paperwork to him.\nMontique ended up applying as an individual in Dec. 2021, also under humanitarian and compassionate grounds.\nWhile his family's application was approved, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) denied Montique's application on Aug. 1 of this year.\nMontique has been ordered to leave by the end of September. His lawyer has launched an appeal on his behalf.\n \n(Submitted by Kemo Montique)\nHe has been ordered to leave Canada by the last week of September. Though he has retained a lawyer who is fighting the deportation decision, Montique said he's devastated at the prospect of leaving his home. \n\"It was so shocking. Canada is a place all about immigrants. It's our number one priority. But it seems there's a strong sense of urgency to remove specific people in the country and I don't understand why,\" he said.\n\"I've never committed a crime. I pay my taxes. I've worked. I've attended school. I've considered Canada my home for many, many years.\"\nHe came to Canada with a college acceptance in hand. Next week, he's scheduled for deportation\nAdrienne Smith, a Toronto immigration lawyer and adjunct professor at Queen's University's law school who isn't involved in the case, said she is disappointed Canada is trying to deport Montique. She said he came here as a child by no choice of his own, and has been living here for 16 years, building a life that includes not just family, but friends, school and work. \n\"At a certain point, just by the sheer amount of time you've been in Canada, establishment is found. Sixteen years in Canada — I'm shocked to hear that an [application] like this wasn't approved,\" said Smith.\n\"He's a Canadian in every sense of the word, except for not having the paper.\"\nMontique fears violence in Jamaica \nAccording to documents Montique provided to CBC Toronto, he was informed on Aug. 2 that IRCC reviewed his application for permanent residency and an officer determined his reasons for staying \"are not sufficient.\" No further explanation was provided. \nA spokesperson for IRCC said in an email statement the ministry can't comment on individual cases due to privacy legislation. \n\"A decision to remove someone from Canada is not taken lightly. Every individual facing removal is entitled to due process, but once all avenues to appeal are exhausted, they are removed from Canada in accordance with Canadian law,\" Loïc Ouellette wrote. \nFamilies awaiting deportation face emotional roller-coaster that can lead to 'chronic stress'\nAfter his permanent residency application was rejected, Montique submitted a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Application (PRRA), which is an application someone who is facing removal can submit to prove they would be in danger if they are sent back to their country of origin. He outlined he is fearful due to a high level of crime and violence in the country.\nThe PRRA was also rejected. In the government's decision, it said that concerns about safety in Jamaica are the same ones faced by every resident of that country, and therefore \"the applicant does not face a risk to life, of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger of torture.\"\nCase raises 'consistency' issues: lawyer\nSmith said the principles under Canadian immigration law is to keep families together and it's concerning to see a family with similar individual circumstances face inconsistencies in who gets approved and who gets denied.\n\"This raises a bigger issue of consistency and decision-making,\" she said. \nMontique, pictured in the back to the right, is seen with members of his extended family in Canada. He says he has no ties to  Jamaica nor any relatives there.  \n \n(Submitted by Kemo Montique)\nIn her practice, Smith said she's noticed decisions often comes down to which officer gets the file, and it's difficult to predict the outcome of different applications.\nMontique's lawyer, Daniel Kingwell, who is a partner at Mamann, Sandaluk and Kingwell LLP in Toronto, said he agrees it's strange that Montique's mother was approved for permanent residency but Montique wasn't. That's because, Kingwell said, their circumstances are the same except that she made the decision to come to Canada as an adult, while Montique grew up in the Toronto-area, which should make his case even more compelling. \n\"As an adult, [Montique is] faced with a situation [he] didn't create,\" said Kingwell, who said this type of decision looks bad on the Canadian government.\n\"It's pretty straightforward … he should get status.\"\nKingwell has launched an appeal on Montique's behalf and said he expects a decision within the next two weeks or so.\nIn the meantime, Montique said he doesn't want to see the same happen to others who were brought to Canada as children.\n\"Our parents made a decision to take us here for whatever reason, they chose to do it out of our control,\" he said.\n\"We should not be treated as criminals, because what have we done wrong?\"\nFamily of 9 facing deportation in Hamilton says immigration process left them 'devastated'\nOttawa pausing deportations of international students affected by acceptance letter scam", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-06T04:00:00.160000", "date_modified": "2023-09-06T10:17:31.756000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

But as AHS is still conducting its investigation, Rizzuti said that families whose children attended any of the 11 sites should continue to monitor for symptoms.\nDr. Tanya Principe, a pediatric emergency physician at the Alberta Children's Hospital, said that she expects to see an increased number of positive cases over the next few days, as further testing is conducted. \n\"We know that most of the time that children will get worse kind of in that five to 10 days of their illness or after 10 days of exposure, so we're monitoring for that right now,\" she said. \n\"Until [we] know what the source was and when it happened, it's hard to predict when we're going to see that peak.\"\nCalgary daycares hit by E. coli outbreak could be shut down for another week\nHow to treat E. coli infections that cause kidney failure in children to be studied in Calgary\nPrincipe stressed that while parents should not panic, they should continue to monitor their children for symptoms and take them to the emergency department if they are unable to drink fluids, have dark urine, have unexplained bleeding or bruising, have a purple rash that does not go away, have any abdominal pain or severe headaches, or otherwise seem unwell. \nThe following daycare centres remained closed until further notice:  \n   \nFueling Brains Braeside.\n   \nFueling Brains West 85th.\n   \nFueling Brains New Brighton.\n   \nFueling Brains Centennial.\n   \nFueling Brains Bridgeland.\n   \nFueling Brains McKnight.\n   \nBraineer Academy.\n   \nKidz Space.\n   \nLittle Oak Early Education (formerly Mangrove).\n   \nAlmond Branch School.\n   \nVIK Academy in Okotoks, Alta.\n  \nAHS has created a resource page for families affected by the outbreak. \nClick here for more information\n.", "author": [{"name": "Kylee Pedersen", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/author/kylee-pedersen-1.6350468", "email": "kylee.pedersen@cbc.ca", "about": "Kylee is a reporter/editor with CBC Calgary.

It's small", "summary": "Conservatives argue the Liberal government's climate measure drives up the cost on everything. The inflation-watching head of the central bank offered some perspective on this.", "content": "There's some, and one could stress \nsome\n, point to the Conservative Party's steady drumbeat.\nIt's inescapably true that the federal carbon tax makes life for Canadians more expensive — before the \"climate action incentive\" rebate — and Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem reiterated this on a visit to Calgary on Thursday.\nHe brought further clarity to the highly charged political discourse by putting a number on it.\nThat number: 0.15 percentage points of the inflation increase can be attributed to the carbon tax.\nMacklem stands firm on 2% inflation target and willingness to hike more to get there\nPierre Poilievre's Conservatives have made much sport of arguing the Trudeau Liberals' tool to fight climate change has severely affected the affordability of fuel, groceries and other goods. While the Opposition party has never put a number on it, the figure has never appeared to be as rhetorically small as Macklem put it.\nIn questions following a luncheon address to the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, the central bank head said his team's inflation-watching takes into consideration the Trudeau government decision to annually hike its price on carbon by $15 per tonne.\n\"So each year it's 0.15 (per cent), but that's a relatively small effect on year-over-year inflation,\" Macklem told reporters.\nA thin slice of the pie\nConsider that impact this way: with year-over-year inflation lately hovering around three per cent, this means the carbon tax causes one-twentieth of price increases. When inflation peaked at just above eight per cent last year, the carbon tax would have been responsible for one-54th of it.\nThere's a big qualifier to this arithmetic. Macklem's arithmetic only covers the direct impact of the carbon tax, meaning how it juices the price of gasoline, natural gas and other fossil fuels.\nInteractive\nHow do your federal carbon tax costs compare to your rebates? This tool helps you calculate that\n\"It does not include second-round effects,\" he clarified.\nAnd it's these knock-on effects that Poilievre has honed in on in his protests of the carbon tax.\n\"We know very simply when you raise the cost of the gas our farmers use to produce the food, and that our truckers use to ship the food, you raise the price of the food itself. Somebody has to pay that price,\" the Conservative leader said at a July event at a \nVancouver grocery store\n.\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has repeatedly highlighted the federal carbon tax in his remarks about rising food prices. He's promised to eliminate the tax if elected. It currently sits at $65 per tonne of carbon dioxide and is slated to rise to $170 by 2030.\n \n(Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\nNormally one to deal in data rather than estimates, Macklem didn't offer a more universal figure on the carbon tax, with the direct fuel markup added to the indirect costs those increases have on goods.\nFor that, we'll go to Trevor Tombe, the University of Calgary economist who's well-versed enough in this matter that he can harness Statistics Canada data to figure out these indirect costs.\nAccording to his calculations, these knock-ons do add to the impact of inflation, but they certainly don't double or triple the blow. In Ontario, the direct and indirect effects inflate prices by 0.207 per cent a year. In Alberta, it's 0.1875 per cent.\nIn other words, we can rightly blame Trudeau's carbon tax for about one-fifteenth of Ontario's current inflation, or one-sixteenth of Alberta's. \"Relatively small,\" is how Macklem put it.\nPoilievre riding high in polls as Conservatives meet for policy convention\nTombe said there is fairness in critiques of the carbon tax, because the accumulation of gradual increases in the tax is making things more expensive, and will continue to do so as the per-tonne rate rises to $170 by 2030, when it will make up a significant chunk of Canadians' gasoline bills.\n\"It's perfectly correct for opponents of the carbon tax to point out that eliminating it would drop prices,\" the economist says.\n\"It's equally correct for supporters of it to note that it's not a driver of inflation.\"\nThese impact measurements do not account for the fixed-price rebate the Trudeau government makes to households every quarter, the climate action incentive payment meant to offset the carbon tax's added costs on vehicle fuel and home heating.\nOn the one hand, that provides a buffer to the inflationary burden that the levy creates; on the other, more money stuffed into Canadians' bank accounts could itself put upward pressure on the increased demand that drives inflation.\nThe spending side\nWhich raises the other government intervention that affects inflation and which Poilievre routinely highlights — government spending. Macklem had no figure for the amount of inflation that can be attributed indirectly to the money Ottawa and the provinces plug into the economy through social programs and other initiatives. \nBut it remains, he said, another factor the Bank of Canada pays attention to as it watches inflation and sets rates, and across all government levels it's growing at about two per cent per year. \n\"It's contributing to the growth of demand in the economy,\" the bank governor said. \"In that sense, it's not helping to slow the economy. It's not helping to relieve those inflationary pressures.\" \nSome bank economists \ncriticize\n the federal government as over-stimulators of inflation. But in a week in which Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and several premiers controversially weighed in on the Bank's interest-rate decisions, Macklem was careful not to direct commentary in the other direction.", "author": [{"name": "Jason Markusoff", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/author/jason-markusoff-1.6448323", "email": "jason.markusoff@cbc.ca", "about": "Jason Markusoff analyzes what's happening — and what isn't happening, but probably should be — in Calgary and sometimes farther afield.

It is known as shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) because it secretes a toxin that can lead to serious organ damage, often targeting the kidneys.\n\"This is one of the most distressing illnesses that we see,\" Freedman said in an interview on \nThe Calgary Eyeopener\n.\nDr. Stephen Freedman, a pediatric emergency medicine physician and professor at the University of Calgary, said the Alberta Children's Hospital is dealing with an influx of kids sick with E. coli.\n \n(Leah Hennel/The Canadian Press)\nComplications include kidney failure\nThis strain is often carried by cattle and can contaminate food, including meat (through the slaughtering process) and fresh produce (through water tainted by infected animal feces).\nEleven child-care centres have been shut down by health officials as they search for the source of this outbreak. Public health investigators suspect the culprit is likely a common food served from a central kitchen.\nWhat is so problematic about this outbreak, according to doctors, is that it has taken root among children under the age of five — one of the most vulnerable groups.\n\"What's scary about this one is that it seems to have a large number of kids involved,\" said Dr. Cora Constantinescu, an infectious diseases specialist at Alberta Children's Hospital.\n   \n \nAlberta health officials report 128 lab-confirmed cases of E. coli linked to outbreak at daycares\n \n  \nEarly in the infection, symptoms can include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), vomiting and fever.\nBut the toxin can eventually lead to a condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), where the toxin enters the blood stream and attacks the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney failure.\nAccording to Constantinescu, while most children who are infected will recover, approximately 10 to 20 per cent will go on to develop HUS.\nHalf of those children will end up on dialysis for kidney failure.\n\"Because this is a serious condition, this is why we're being so hyper-vigilant about it,\" she said.\nOn Thursday, AHS confirmed nine children had been diagnosed with HUS. But the health authority didn't say how many patients are on dialysis.\nDr. Cora Constantinescu is a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary.\n \n(Submitted by Cora Constantinescu)\n'Insidious' illness\nTreatment for this type of E. coli includes intravenous fluids to manage dehydration.\nAnd because HUS can be quietly damaging the organs as initial symptoms appear to resolve, infected children, including those who don't require hospitalization, need close monitoring, including blood tests every 24 hours.\n\"It is quite insidious. So it kind of starts to manifest when the children seem to be getting better. But it's at that point in time that the complications start to emerge,\" Freedman said.\n\"You're taking a previously healthy toddler to dialysis in about six days.\"\nKey symptoms\nDoctors are urging parents to watch their children closely.\n\"If your child has symptoms, they should be seen. Don't manage that at home because it could start off pretty mild but then end up pretty bad,\" said Constantinescu.\nAHS has set up a \nwebpage\n for Albertans looking for information on this E. coli outbreak.\n\"We have a lot of worried parents and families,\" said Dr. Tania Principi, a pediatric ER physician and clinical associate professor at the University of Calgary.\nAccording to Principi, children connected to the outbreak who show any of the following symptoms should be taken to the emergency room:\n   \ndiarrhea (may or may not be bloody)\n   \ninability to drink fluids\n   \ninfrequent urination (less than once every 12 hours)\n   \ntea-coloured urine\n   \nunexplained bleeding, bruising or a purple rash\n   \nsevere abdominal pain, severe headaches         \n  \nDr. Tania Principi, a pediatric ER physician, said it's important to catch HUS early and she's urging parents to watch their children closely.\n \n(Tania Principi)\n\"Our aim is to really catch people early on in the illness and ensure that they have adequate hydration to try and prevent that cascade or that deterioration to worse outcomes,\" said Principi.\nDeaths are extremely rare, she noted. No children have died as a result of this outbreak, according to AHS.\nUniversity of Alberta infectious disease specialist, Dr. Lynora Saxinger, said there could also be longer term health problems.\n\"Most kids, even those with more severe organ damage, do recover to have functional kidneys again,\" she said.\n\"But even some of those can later on show that they actually have lost some kidney function and might need special monitoring in the future as well.\"\nCommunity transmission\nThere are also concerns about secondary infections, if children spread the illness to family members or other close contacts.\nThe bacteria can pass from one person to another through fecal-oral transmission. That can happen if someone doesn't wash their hands properly after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper, for example.\n\"Within-household transmission is a major concern,\" said Freedman, noting seniors are another very high risk group.\n\"For those grandparents who are involved in care, I would really, really try to minimize or eliminate exposure if at all possible.\"\nMeanwhile, he estimates the onslaught of cases will hit its peak this weekend.\nAccording to Freedman, children usually start having symptoms within 10 days of exposure, often earlier.

The Liberals committed to following through on such a recommendation.\nDavid Johnston resigned as special rapporteur on foreign interference in June.\n \n(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\nWhile Johnston did conclude that foreign governments are attempting to influence Canadian politics, he ultimately recommended against an inquiry, arguing that much of the classified information he had reviewed would need to remain secret.\nJohnston's findings triggered outrage among the opposition parties. The NDP put forward a motion in the House of Commons calling for Johnston's resignation. The motion passed with the support of the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois, which had questioned Johnston's impartiality since he was first appointed. \nJohnston resigned the position in June, saying his role had become too muddled in political controversy for him to continue.\nJustice Marie-Josée Hogue 'honoured' to lead foreign interference inquiry, hearing start to be determined\nNDP MP, Beijing critics call on Ottawa to launch foreign agent registry quickly\nAll parties agree the 2019 and 2021 federal election results were not compromised. But in the wake of Johnston's probe, opposition MPs argued that a public inquiry into foreign interference would be the only way to maintain Canadians' confidence in the electoral system.\nFollowing Johnston's resignation, the Liberals agreed to a public inquiry and House leaders from the main federal parties met over the summer to set the terms and timeline. They also discussed who should helm the inquiry.\nEarlier this summer, the \nNational Post reported\n that the Liberal government was having trouble finding a commissioner to oversee the inquiry.\nHow is this different from what Johnston was doing?\nWhile Hogue will be examining many of the same issues that Johnston was, she will be heading a much more formal process.\nLike Johnston, Hogue is being tasked with investigating interference by China, Russia, other foreign states and non-state actors in the 2019 and 2021 elections. She'll also look at how intelligence flowed to decision-makers in the context of the past two elections.\nThe government gave Johnston clearance to review security documents and documents covered by cabinet confidence.

The Quebec judge will have the power to subpoena witnesses for those hearings, including the prime minister and members of his cabinet, and will decide if hearings should be kept out of the public eye due to national security concerns.\nBut it's not clear how many of those hearings will be in public.\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said Thursday that all parties agreed the hearings should at least begin in public \"so that Canadians will understand why certain highly classified intelligence information has to be treated by law in a confidential manner.\"\nHogue and her team can then decide when to move hearings behind closed doors.\nWATCH | Foreign interference commissioner has deadlines\nForeign interference commissioner has deadlines but can ask to extend them\n1 day ago\nDuration \n1:22\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc says all opposition leaders are 'firmly' in agreement with the deadlines for Justice Marie-Josee Hogue to submit her reports on foreign interference.\nHogue's appointment will be less contentious than Johnston's. The Conservatives, Johnston's most vocal critics, said they approved of Hogue leading the inquiry.\n\"We arrived where we are today with a process that was more inclusive of opposition parties and I can tell you we do accept the nomination of Justice Hogue,\" Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer told reporters Thursday.\nNDP House Leader Peter Julian said his party wanted to ensure the person leading the inquiry was \"free of political involvement.\"\n\"We have now a judge in place that has the confidence of all recognized parties,\" he said.\nWATCH | Conservatives accept Hogue's appointment\nConservatives 'accept' new foreign interference commissioner, says Scheer\n24 hours ago\nDuration \n1:08\nRegina-Qu'Appelle MP Andrew Scheer says his party hopes to get 'real answers' on foreign interference with the appointment of Justice Marie-Josee Hogue to the role.\nHow much information will be made public?\nWhen he released his first report, Johnston cautioned that a public inquiry wouldn't be able to reveal much due to national security concerns.\nJustice Hogue will be able to decide when a hearing should take place behind closed doors.\nBut her mandate allows her to consider alternatives to disclosing information revealed during closed-door hearings.\nFor example, Hogue could release a summary of the evidence heard in camera if she believes it wouldn't harm national security interests or violate national security laws.\nJustice Marie-Josée Hogue from the Quebec Court of Appeal has been tapped to lead the public inquiry into foreign election interference. \n \n(Université de Sherbrooke)\nFormer CSIS director Richard Fadden told CBC's News Network that he hopes Hogue will be generous with what she releases to the public.\n\"She can protect national security while making a great deal of it public.

{"url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/hidden-valley-ombudsman-first-report-1.6960257", "title": "Hidden Valley parents should have been told 'immediately' about sex abuse allegations, Yukon Ombudsman says", "summary": "A report released by the Yukon Ombudsman’s office Thursday concluded the department’s delay in informing parents about sexual abuse allegations against an educational assistant in 2019 was unwarranted, unfair and a “communications failure.” ", "content": "The Yukon education department should have immediately told Hidden Valley Elementary School parents about sexual abuse allegations against an educational assistant in 2019, but kept quiet until a news story forced it to acknowledge the situation a year-and-a-half later.\nThat was among the findings in a report released by the Yukon Ombudsman Thursday, which concluded the department's delay in informing parents was unwarranted, unfair and a \"communications failure.\" \nEntitled \nLeft In The Dark\n, the report is the first of two from the ombudsman and follows separate reviews by the territory's child and youth advocate and a Yukon-government-hired lawyer. All centre on why the government didn't inform Hidden Valley parents after a student reported in November 2019 that he'd been sexually abused by educational assistant William Auclair-Bellemare.\nWhile Auclair-Bellemare was immediately removed from the school and later pleaded guilty to one count of sexual interference, the report says it wasn't until CBC News reported on a lawsuit filed by the victim in July 2021 that parents learned about the situation. \nThe article triggered outrage and led to two new alleged victims to \ncome forward\n to police (the charges in one case were later \nstayed by the Crown\n, while a verdict is pending in the other).  \nThe ombudsman's office launched its investigation in October 2021 after receiving a complaint from a parent alleging the department's delay in sharing information \"aggrieved\" families and also resulted in other students allegedly victimized by Auclair-Bellemare not getting support soon enough.\nThe report, signed by ombudsman Jason Pedlar and investigator Rick Smith, concluded that the complaint was valid.\nParents lost 'critical opportunity' to talk to kids, get help right away\nThe ombudsman's office found the education department \"quickly contemplated\" sharing information — a letter from the school principal to parents was drafted as early as Dec. 13, 2019.\nThe letter was never sent. Instead, the Public Service Commission, justice department and RCMP \"became involved\" and \"amplified\" legal and privacy concerns about sharing the information. While the focus should have been on the obligation to notify Hidden Valley parents about the allegations, the report says the discussion devolved into what could be shared with the public.\nAs a result, nothing was shared at all.\n'We could have done a much better job,' says head of Yukon RCMP on Hidden Valley school sexual abuse case\nHad parents been told right away, they could have had the \"critical opportunity to talk to their children and provide or seek any necessary supports in a timely manner,\" the report says, and it also \"likely would have prompted disclosures from additional child victims.\"\nThe education department, the report continues, had resources that should have guided staff on how to act, including a government-wide communications policy.\nHowever, while the policy says senior leadership should have input on communications about serious issues, \"important decision-making\" about Auclair-Bellemare was largely left to \"lower-level individuals\" in 2019, the report says, with little to no oversight from the deputy minister, minister or cabinet. \nThe report also found the department did not abide by a number of principles within the communication policy, including being \"a responsible public service.\"  \n\"Put in the context of the parents, it is reasonable to expect that a responsible public service, especially in the emergent situation of child sexualized abuse, would coordinate its applicable communication resources and inform the parents in an accurate and timely manner,\" the report says. \n\"As a result, the evidence shows that the parents were outraged at the Department's lack of communication with them. It left them feeling that the Department was not taking the [Auclair-Bellemare] matter seriously or had other motives.\"\nThe education department also had a \"comprehensive\" crisis communications manual with step-by-step instructions and \"context-specific communication templates,\" the report says, including on sexual assault in school and staff-to-student violence. \nAs well, the department paid for \"crisis communications plan licensing\" and \"crisis communication drill\" contracts in 2014, though it's unclear what became of the contracts and whether the crisis communications manual was used. \n\"All we know is that an alleged sexual assault in the school had been duly reported [in 2019] but, despite having paid for specific and professional guidance… the Department kept silent,\" the report says.\nHad department staff referred to the manual or communications policy, there may have also been a \"more focused discussion\" about why it was necessary to tell parents about the situation, the report says. \nDepartment 'would likely have maintained its silence'\nThe department's decision to not communicate \"abruptly changed\" after CBC News published an article about a lawsuit filed by the 2019 victim, the report says, leading to the RCMP receiving new information about other alleged victims and mounting parental pressure for \"vital information.\" \nThe department \"found itself unexpectedly having to react to the result\" of the article and did an \"about-face,\" sending parents a letter in August 2021 and holding a Zoom meeting in November where it shared information previously deemed too-legally-risky.\n\"If it were not for the media story,\" the report says, \"we are of the view that the Department would likely have maintained its silence about the [Auclair-Bellemare] matter, thus perpetuating the unfairness of depriving the parents from taking any timely action concerning their children and also withholding information that, once released, directly led to two more disclosures of criminal behaviour.\" \nParents shouldn't have had to learn about the Auclair-Bellemare matter through the media, the report says, nor should they have had to wait as long as they did to access counselling and other resources.\nYukon government releases plan to fix failures revealed in review of Hidden Valley sexual abuse case\nYukon government response to 2019 Hidden Valley sexual abuse case 'inadequate,' review confirms\nWhile the department met its legal obligation in reporting the matter in 2019 to the RCMP, and family and children's services, it failed to meet its legal and policy obligations to tell parents, the report says. It notes that at no point was the department prevented from informing parents by either privacy legislation or a publication ban.\nThe report does not make any recommendations. Instead, it says the ombudsman will issue a second report this fall examining whether the Safer Schools Action Plan, developed by the education department in response to the Yukon-government-ordered report, adequately addresses and mitigates the issues it identified. \nYukon Education Minister Jeanie McLean was not immediately available for an interview, but said in a press release that the territorial government accepts the report's findings. ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The land transfer tax increase for luxury homes is set to take effect Jan. 1, 2024.\nCouncillors also decided to direct city staff to report back on plans to implement a foreign buyer land transfer tax, introduce a commercial parking levy and increase the vacant home tax from one to three per cent.\nIn addition, councillors decided to ask the Ontario government to allow the city to implement a municipal sales tax and/or a cut of the existing harmonized sales tax. Such a tax could generate as much as $1 billion per year for the city. That tax, which would be applied to the purchase of goods and services in Toronto, would require provincial approval and an amendment of the City of Toronto Act.\nToronto Mayor Olivia Chow urged councillors to work together to address the financial crisis.

And if further help is needed, Toronto should either pull money from its reserve accounts or approach Premier Doug Ford's provincial government.\n\"The ability of the federal government to spend is not infinite — and the emergency support we provided during the pandemic led directly to the excellent fiscal position that the province of Ontario currently enjoys,\" Freeland wrote at the time.\nCouncil approves ask to feds for $750K to help asylum seekers\nDespite past rejections, Chow introduced a new motion to \nagain ask the federal government for more funding\n, this time citing city's \noverburdened shelter system\n.\nCouncil approved the motion — with a deadline of Sept. 18 — and also approved a plan that it pull from reserve funds to bolster its shelter system in the event that Ottawa doesn't provide more money.

The festival brings more than 700,000 visitors to Toronto and accounts for more than $114 million in economic activity in the region, \naccording to a 2022 report from FedDev Ontario.\n\"In many ways for North America, TIFF is the most important festival,\" said filmmaker and writer Brian D. Johnson, whose film \nThe Colour of Ink\n premiered at TIFF last year. It's a significant gateway for international films to reach audiences in North America, he says.\nBut with the ongoing Hollywood actors' and writers' strikes, this year's event will have fewer stars in attendance. And that could have a significant impact on businesses in the city that rely on the festival and its stars to generate buzz and, of course, profits. \nFewer stars, less spending\nDuring the strikes, members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) are restricted from promoting any film that's from a member of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). That includes major film studios (Disney, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros.), television networks (ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC) and streaming services like Netflix, Apple TV+ and Amazon.\nHowever, directors and producers are unaffected by the strike — and some are allowed to walk red carpets. This year, several actor-turned-directors have films at TIFF, including Viggo Mortensen, Michael Keaton, Chris Pine and Anna Kendrick.\nActor Viggo Mortensen is pictured on the red carpet for the North American premiere of Crimes of the Future, in Toronto, on May 30, 2022. Mortensen’s The Dead Don’t Hurt and Michael Keaton’s Knox Goes Away are among the actor-to-director-led titles added to the Toronto International Film Festival.\n \n(Chris Young/The Canadian Press)\nFurther complicating things, SAG-AFTRA has launched an interim agreement program for certain independent movies being distributed by non-AMPTP members, which means they can promote films despite the strikes. But as TIFF begins, it's still unclear which films have been granted waivers. That lack of certainty means a lack of stars, something that TIFF and Toronto businesses are having to deal with.\n\"With the actors' strike in particular, Toronto's going to see a dip in revenue because there's all kinds of infrastructure and support services from hairdressers and limo drivers to restaurants,\" said Johnson, who wrote the book \nBrave Films, Wild Nights: 25 Years of Festival Fever\n, which highlights the history of TIFF.  \nBusinesses in the city are already feeling that dip. \nCharles Khabouth is the CEO of INK Entertainment Group. He owns and operates more than 20 venues in Toronto and says TIFF is one of their most important events. \n\"It's the most exciting time of year. It's a very crucial moment for us,\" said Khabouth, who just celebrated 40 years in business. \nBut with the ongoing strikes, Khabouth says he's already had to make adjustments.\n\"Usually at this time, we're beyond busy setting up because of the amount of events. Last year, I think we did north of 40 events in 10 days.\"\nINK has already had to cancel multiple events for this year's festival, according to Khabouth. \nWatch | Hollywood North fades:\n \nHits to Hollywood North deepen as writers and actors strikes drag on\n1 month ago\nDuration \n1:59\nThe screen actors and writers strikes have halted production on the vast majority of Hollywood productions in Canada. More than 90 per cent of film and TV workers are off the job with no end to the strikes in sight.\nAnd it's not just venues that are feeling the effects of the strikes.\nRob Iafrate is the owner of A Celebrity Limousine Service in Toronto. He says TIFF is one of his biggest corporate events. \n\"[It's] hundreds of thousands of dollars potentially to be lost. It's definitely a big deal for us,\" he said. \nBecause of the size of the festival, Iafrate says, the company would typically need to outsource vehicles in addition to its own cars, creating work for an additional 10 to 20 other companies.\nThis year, that won't be happening. \nA 'chance to shine'\nDespite the uncertainty, both Khabouth and Iafrate say they're trying to view this year's festival as a unique opportunity. \n\"This year being quite different, I think, allows us to rethink things,\" said Khabouth. \"We're able to turn a negative into a positive ... and it'll be great to have more Canadian films and local actors.\"\nVideo\nFilmmakers hope for more spotlight on diverse Canadian stories amid Hollywood strikes\nWith fewer celebrities hogging the spotlight, the focus will turn to independent artists, says Iafrate.\n\"There may be new and breaking-out artists to be found, and now's their chance to shine,\" he said. \nIt's something TIFF CEO Cameron Bailey has talked about as well. \n\"Canadian films and filmmakers always have a prominent place at our festival. But I think this year, they'll be even more prominent,\" he said during an interview with CBC News last month. \nCanadian films to take the spotlight during 2023 Toronto International Film Festival\nThere will be 50 Canadian titles at this year's festival, including 21 features, 20 shorts, six documentaries and three television series, said TIFF's chief programming officer, Anita Lee. \nQuestions remain\nIn addition to the reduced star power, TIFF and lead sponsor Bell will be parting ways after this year. It's another cloud of uncertainty hanging over the festival. In 2022, \ncorporate sponsorships accounted for $13.4 million\n, which amounted to 28 per cent of TIFF's total revenues.\n\"Over the past 28 years, TIFF and Bell have enjoyed a historic partnership,\" said Judy Lung, vice-president, public relations and communications at TIFF. \"Earlier this year, we mutually agreed that this partnership would come to a close at the end of 2023.\" \nBell echoed the same sentiments when reached for comment, saying it opted not to renew its sponsorship with TIFF in order to invest in other opportunities. \"We're grateful to have been a part of it,\" the company said in a statement emailed to CBC News.\nThe TIFF Bell Lightbox is seen in the Entertainment District of Toronto. TIFF and lead sponsor Bell announced they will be parting ways after this year.\n \n(The Canadian Press)\nIn the meantime, the festival already has existing relationships with other companies, including Netflix.\nIn 2019, Netflix and TIFF signed a three-year agreement to have the streaming service financially support Canadian directors. And Netflix will premiere five films at this year's festival.\n\"Undoubtedly, there will be another lead sponsor stepping in to replace Bell,\" said Johnson.\n\"I really hope TIFF can come out of this. It may come out a bit leaner. It may come out a little bit less showbizzy, but you have to have that glitz, I think, to make a festival attractive.\"", "author": [{"name": "Brock Wilson", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/author/brock-wilson-1.6243218", "email": "brock.wilson@cbc.ca", "about": "Brock Wilson is a producer based in Toronto.

But this September, that's overshadowed with uncertainty about how best to support his transgender and non-binary students.\nTwo weeks ago, then-education minister Dustin Duncan announced \nseveral new policies\n in schools throughout Saskatchewan. That includes students under 16 needing permission from their parent or guardian to change their name or pronouns at school. Consent is not required for students 16 or older. \nUnder the minister's directive, teachers are now obligated to inform the student's family of these changes, regardless of whether they have permission from the student. That doesn't sit well with Boutilier.\n\"In my mind, that's the kid's information to share,\" he said. \nThe new policy \"has made the return to school for many students feel less safe. And it's created a division before the students have even returned to the building.\" \nYouth advocate reviewing Sask. policy requiring schools to get parental permission for pronoun changes\nThe province told CBC News in a statement that it's up to local school divisions to ensure their staff complies with the policy.\n\"The Ministry of Education is committed to working with school divisions on implementing this policy and any challenges that may arise in implementing it,\" the statement said.\n\"It is the Ministry of Education's expectation that the policy is followed, and parents should notify their local school division if there is an instance where it hasn't been.\"\nDespite classes starting this week, some school divisions tell CBC News they're still looking for clarity from the province on the policy directive. Others declined to comment on how they plan to enforce the changes, citing the ongoing court action.\nParents or guardians are now required to fill out a form, such as this one provided in the Saskatchewan government’s latest policy document, if their child under 16 requests to be called by a different first name or pronoun at school.\n \n(Government of Saskatchewan)\nCourt challenge\nIn the wake of the ministry's announcement, the University of Regina's Pride Centre for Sexuality and Gender Diversity and Egale Canada \nfiled an application against the provincial government\n. It says the policy violates the rights of gender-diverse students under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Lawyers from both sides are expected in court on Tuesday.\nLegal action filed against Sask. government over new school pronoun rules\nThe \nSaskatchewan School Boards Association has also stepped in\n, saying school divisions were not consulted about the changes and requested the policies be paused pending a review — something Premier Scott Moe said last week he is not considering.\n\"This isn't a policy that was dreamt up by a couple of elected members. This is a policy that many, if not all, of the government caucus MLAs have had discussions with parents, and ultimately with constituents, over the course of the last number of years — not just the course of the last number of months,\" Moe told reporters after announcing Battlefords MLA \nJeremy Cockrill would be replacing \nDuncan as education minister. \nCockrill will be tasked with overseeing the implementation of this policy.\n\"If you have a child that is looking to transition, looking to identify by a different name or pronoun, that parent is, I think, in the best position to help support that child not only just at school but in all aspects of their life,\" Cockrill said last week.\nWhen asked about children who may not feel safe disclosing a wish to be called by a different name or pronoun, Cockrill said the province will \"make sure that in the implementation plans with the 27 school divisions that there are supports offered to those students.\"\nRegina elementary school teacher Steve Boutilier, who's been teaching for 16 years, said he felt ‘a combination of sadness and anger’ when he heard about the Ministry of Education’s new parental inclusion and consent policies.\n \n(Jessie Anton/CBC)\n'Goal is never secrecy': Teacher\nBoutilier, who's been teaching for more than a decade, said he and many of his fellow educators have been supporting students in their gender identity journeys for years.\n\"The first thing that I would do if a kid told me they wanted to use different pronouns is I'd ask them, 'Do your parents know?' … And if the answer is no, then we unpack that conversation and see if we can find a way to reconcile that or find a way to make that possible. And if that's not the case, then we would involve either the school counselor or larger support systems in order to make sure they're getting the support they need,\" he explained.\n\"The goal is never secrecy. The goal is always the safety and the well-being of the child.\"\nPoilievre says schools should leave LGBTQ issues to parents\nSask. premier touts survey showing support for informing parents of name, pronoun changes in school\nManmeet Singh, a Regina father of two, said the well-being of his daughters is top of mind for him when he advocates in favour of the policy.\n\"Parents are responsible for their children up until the age of 18 when they can leave the house,\" Singh told CBC News. \n\"I am involved in their life financially, emotionally and I'm going to be there for them through their early years. Why should I not be the one holding their hand, guiding them, rather than [teachers] doing it for me?\"\nBoutilier said he sees many parents rooting for the new policy are largely coming from a place of compassion, but he noted that's not the case for all students.\n\"I totally understand the perspective of the importance of the parental relationship. But we need to acknowledge that not every parental relationship is created equal and we need to create policy that allows for that,\" he said.\nLISTEN | CBC Radio host Stefani Langenegger talks with former education minister Dustin Duncan after the announcement:  \nThe Morning Edition - Sask\n17:02\nSask. education minister talks new policy requiring schools to get parental permission for pronoun changes\nThe province's education minister is making some changes ahead of the new school year.

Host Stefani Langenegger talks with education minister Dustin Duncan.\nKeeping queer educators safe\nEven with a loving and accepting family, Mike Megenbir said it took him more than 30 years to tell them he was two-spirit.\n\"No one could have forced me to do it. I had to do it when I was ready — I had to be ready in my head,\" he said. \n\"And now, that may not be happening for some students.\"\nMegenbir — a former Regina elementary school teacher who's now working toward his masters in counseling and mental health therapy at the First Nations University of Canada — said in the aftermath of this policy announcement, he'd be nervous returning to school this fall as both an educator and student.\nTeacher who came out as transgender at school inspires students and colleagues to live their truths\nHaving \ncome out at school while teaching\n a few years ago, Megenbir said having a positive work environment was integral for him to feel open about his true identity.

Prior to 1960 lead was a common plumbing material.\nProlonged exposure to lead can create health complications. Pregnant women and children under the age of six are most at risk.\nRegina city council voted in 2021 to implement a timeline for its \nLead Service Connection Management Program\n (LSCMP) to replace all lead water service connections in Regina by 2036 for a cost of $36 million.\nProposed Regina bylaw to make lead pipe replacement mandatory for some homeowners headed to council\nRegina residents petitioning city to replace remaining lead pipes by 2026\nCity administration had \nrecommended\n that it move all future reports on the lead service connection management program to an informal process. That would've seen the updates come to council in the form of a memo or email correspondence rather than a report being presented in an executive council and council meeting on an annual basis.\nWard 3 Coun.

Although property owners are responsible for the cost of replacing the privately owned connection, the city has implemented options to allow it to be paid over up to 10 years. Those costs on the city side are being covered by a two per cent hike to the utility rate in 2022.\nAccording to the report in front of executive committee on Wednesday, 233 city-owned lead service connections were crossed off the list in 2022, either through replacement or investigation that determined the lead line no longer exists.\nThe city has an annual goal of 220 city-owned replacements.

Newman, who for more than a half-century unearthed revelations while chronicling power brokers on Parliament Hill and in Canadian boardrooms — earning praise for his writing style and occasionally the wrath of his subjects — has died. He was 94.\nAlvy Newman, his wife, told The Canadian Press that the celebrated author died on Thursday morning in Belleville, Ont., from complications related to a stroke he had suffered last year. He had developed Parkinson's disease after the stroke, she said.\nWhen Newman published his first book, \nThe\n Flame of Power: The Story of Canada's Greatest Businessmen\n, at 29, the jacket described the newcomer as \"intrigued with the power wielded by that small golden group whose acquisitive itch has catapulted them beyond the prosaic strivings of ordinary men.\" It was a description written by Newman himself, he revealed in the 2005 memoir \nHere Be Dragons: Telling Tales of People, Passion and Power\n.\nDecades later, Newman told CBC's \nThe Hour\n more pithily that he wanted to be remembered as a \"shit disturber.\"\n\"I'm neutral, I attack everybody,\" he said. \"I think they need to be attacked, they're responsible to us.\"\nIn more than two dozen books and hundreds of columns in major Canadian publications, Newman put prime ministers under the spotlight as well as business titans including Conrad Black, Leonard Asper, the Bronfman family and the men over the course of centuries who led the Hudson's Bay Company.\nAfter his first reporting job at the Financial Post and a two-year stint as the Toronto Star's editor in chief, Newman served as editor of Maclean's from 1971 to 1982, where it gained influence at the height of the magazine boom as he oversaw its transition to a weekly publication.\nWATCH l Newman on Canadian politics, and Mulroney's unvarnished take on Newman: \nPeter C. Newman\n12 years ago\nDuration \n13:36\nIconic Canadian author and journalist Peter C. Newman talks about the Liberal party and causing trouble for politicians.\nEntering journalism, he was inspired by writers such as Ralph Ellison, Anthony Sampson and Norman Mailer, becoming a Canadian practitioner of what was described as \"the New Journalism,\" a form of narrative non-fiction marked by a subjective style.\nNewman reached his pre-eminence as a Canadian commentator after arriving in Halifax in late 1940 as a \"Jewish refugee with faulty English,\" he wrote in his memoir.\nNewman was appointed to the Order of Canada in 1978 and promoted to the rank of companion in 1990, recognized as a \"chronicler of our past and interpreter of our present.\"\nMulroney tapes controversy\nBeginning with 1963's\n Renegade in Power: The Diefenbaker Years\n, Newman's books and columns in major Canadian publications took on the most powerful office in the country, a trend that followed with books such as \nA Nation Divided: Canada and the Coming of Pierre Trudeau\n (1969) and \nThe Secret Mulroney Tapes: Unguarded Confessions of a Prime Minister\n (2005).\nBrian Mulroney considered the book a personal betrayal after a decades-long relationship, later describing in 2007's \nMemoirs: 1939–1993 \nearly sailing trips on the Rideau Canal with Newman, \"whiling away the hours in funny, stimulating and gossipy political discussions.\"\nBased on 98 interviews conducted over 12 years, \nThe Secret Mulroney Tapes \nwas eagerly received by the Ottawa press gang, given it contained Mulroney's unvarnished and sometimes harsh assessments of the man he defeated for the party leadership, Joe Clark; his successor Kim Campbell; as well as former ally Lucien Bouchard and Liberal prime minister Jean Chrétien.\nWATCH l Hudson Bay volume a tale of 'Canadian survival': Newman: \nBarbara Frum talks with writer Peter C. Newman\n3 years ago\nDuration \n8:03\nThe Journal takes a look at Peter C. Newman's new book The Company of Adventurers, a popular history of the Hudson Bay Company. (Original broadcast Oct. 28, 1985)\nOn Clyde Wells, the Newfoundland premier who helped doom the Meech Lake accord in 1990, Newman quotes Mulroney as saying, \"nothing has ever compared to the lack of principle of this son of a bitch.\"\nMulroney knew Newman recorded their conversations and didn't challenge the book's accuracy, but he disputed the ownership of the tapes and wanted to direct how any profits from them should be distributed. The former prime minister filed a lawsuit, although the matter was settled out of court before reaching trial.\nDigital Archives\n8:35\nWas John Diefenbaker a good prime minister?\nBiographer Peter C. Newman says no, callers say yes.\nNewman downplayed their closeness — yes, Mulroney was in the wedding party of his third marriage in the mid-1970s, he said, but they hadn't spoken since 2001.\nIt was far from the first time Newman was assailed by his subjects. Former prime minister John Diefenbaker, in notes found in his personal collection, described the author as a \"literary scavenger of trash,\" while Black threatened to sue after 1982's\n The Establishment Man: Conrad Black, A Portrait of Power\n.\n\"Conrad Black, who I had some considerable part in inventing, became the poster boy for capitalism gone berserk,\" Newman wrote years later.\nDocumented Liberal Party nadir\nIn what turned out to be his last major book on contemporary politics, Newman depicted Michael Ignatieff's return to Canada and nomination as Liberal Party leader after years of acclaim as a political thought leader in British and American academic circles.\nInstead of a tale of triumph, campaign blunders and a third-place showing in the 2011 election yielded that year's, \nWhen the Gods Changed: The Death of Liberal Canada\n.\nNewman predicted doom for the Liberal Party in an interview with CBC's \nThe House\n while promoting the book.\n\"They've lost their Toronto fortress, their Maritime fortress and Quebec fortress and they haven't been out west in awhile,\" he said.\nLISTEN l Newman on the Liberal Party's dreadful 2011:\n \nThe House\n13:54\nPeter C. Newman - Interview\nNewman, on the same book tour, demurred when a Belleville, Ont., reporter asked about a potential book on Stephen Harper and his Conservative government.\n\"He's not interesting enough. There's no human dimension,\" said Newman.\nNot just a confidante or foil of the powerful, Newman often took on the broader subject of what it means to be Canadian, including in the context of sharing a continent with the world's superpower.\n\"This country remains fallow ground for heroism,\" he wrote in the 2010 essay collection \nHeroes: Canadian Champions, Dark Horses, and Icons\n. \"Risk-takers — and every hero must be one — cannot play to a public that ranks our pledge to preserve peace, order and good government above the Yanks' pursuit of hedonism and happiness.\"\n'Flight from fear' to Canada\nHe was born Peta Neumann to Jewish parents on May 10, 1929, in Vienna. His mother, Wanda, had insisted on an Austrian hospital over the border from their native Czechoslovakia. His father, Oscar, owned a beet refinery, the main employer in his small Moravian town in Czechoslovakia, leading to a privileged upbringing in a manor with servants until the German occupation began in 1938.\nThey left their Breclav residence shortly before Nazi officers took it over, he wrote in his memoir, leading to a months-long \"flight from fear\" across Europe with his parents and aunt to get to Canada, after a fortuitous meeting with a Canadian Pacific Railway executive in Europe helped pave the way for a successful entrance visa — provided the family was baptised in the Catholic Church.\nNewman speaks to an interviewer on Oct. 25, 1968.  \n \n(The Canadian Press)\nIn \nHere Be Dragons\n, Newman wrote about the struggles of his parents assimilating to Canadian life, the death of his father in 1950 and his own, almost desperate search for identity.\n\"Nothing compares with being a refugee; you are robbed of context and you flail about, searching for self-definition. When I ultimately arrived in Canada, what I wanted was to gain a voice. To be heard,\" he said.\nHe wrote sometimes scathingly about teachers and classmates at Toronto's Upper Canada College. The University of Toronto and especially the Canadian Royal Navy came off better in his recollection.\nHe was a naval reservist for decades, reaching the rank of captain, leading to a double life \"as a pushy journalist and an undercover naval officer, in love with both professions and determined not to betray the integrity of either. It was a tough gig.\"\nThat conundrum, as well as his close access to the influential, led to some ethical challenges. Newman admitted he was, in effect, used in the late 1960s by Pierre Trudeau and Marc Lalonde, who he said supplied him with false information in order to help damage intraparty Liberal rivals.\nWhen writing on the navy — at such times he would have his naval pay suspended, he later wrote — he admitted to \"playing into the navy's agenda of goading its political masters into spending more on its appropriations.\"\nLamented his personal faults\nAccustomed to turning his sharp eye outwards, in his memoir he lamented the personal faults that helped lead to three failed marriages and estrangement from the daughter born to his first wife.\nOf his second wife, the fellow Maclean's journalist Christina McCall, Newman wrote years later: \"In the end, we divorced over religious differences: I thought I was God, and she didn't. She haunts me still.\"\nNewman, often in a sailor's cap for his public and television appearances, continued writing at a prolific pace even after undergoing a quadruple bypass in 1998, telling the Toronto Star in 2009 he sometimes spent up to 15 hours a day at his desk.\nIn 2012, he told then-CBC host George Stroumboulopoulos that in his writing he was \"searching for the ring of truth,\" as objective truth was \"too big a concept.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-07T12:02:47.553000", "date_modified": "2023-09-07T13:03:20.948000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

And while many thought in the lead-up to the 2008 election that the Conservatives could achieve a breakthrough in Quebec, the Harper government's decision to cut $45 million from arts and culture programs soured that opportunity, he said.\nSingh launches broadside against Poilievre as New Democrats prepare for Parliament's return\nAnalysis\nThe politics of housing now defines both Trudeau and Poilievre\n\"Cultural cuts, as they were called back then, sort of meant the end of Conservative support in the province.

But we lost the communications battle and in politics, the reality is that perception is reality,\" Soudas said.\nBourque said that only an erosion of Bloc support could allow the Conservatives to make a real breakthrough — something he doesn't see happening right now.\n\"That's why there's this sort of stalemate right now on the Conservative numbers,\" he said.\nWATCH | Conservative ad looks to rebrand Poilievre: \nConservatives reintroduce Pierre Poilievre with $3M ad campaign\n30 days ago\nDuration \n1:58\nThe Conservative Party of Canada is reintroducing leader Pierre Poilievre to Canadians with a $3 million ad campaign that some insiders say is a move to rebrand him with a softer image.\nDeLorey said it's proven to be difficult to shift Quebecers away from their comfort zone with the Bloc. Even the endorsement of a popular premier like Francois Legault did not substantially boost Erin O'Toole's fortunes in 2021.\nBut Soudas argued that Poilievre has two key advantages not enjoyed by previous Conservative leaders: his francophone last name and his strong command of the language.\nHe also cited a major series of ads that included a French voiceover by Poilievre's wife, Anaida, who grew up in Montreal.\nSoudas said he believes \"Quebecers vote with their heart\" and Poilievre has a shot to make a serious dent if he is able to connect with Quebecers.\n\"He has all the ingredients to win more than 10 seats in the province of Quebec.\"\nWATCH | At Issue | Should the Liberals be worried about Poilievre's momentum? \nAt Issue | Should the Liberals be worried about Poilievre’s momentum?\n17 hours ago\nDuration \n22:35\nThe end of summer brought with it a new political narrative, with increasing pressure on the Liberal government to help Canadians through an affordability crisis — something the Conservatives have been successfully leveraging.

Increased drug use because the youth feel disengaged from their own community,\" she said.\n\"[The drop-in program] was a safe place for them to be where no one would move them along. I think with that being removed, there is, in all likelihood, a lot of youth that will start to feel really disengaged again and not know where to go and what to do, and I'm hoping that they don't get themselves into trouble.\"\n20 active street gangs in region\nA 2022 estimate from WRPS found about 400 youth are involved in 20 active street gangs in the Region of Waterloo.\nCompare that to ten years ago, when only one known youth gang was operating in the region.\nA \nreport by The Waterloo Regional Gang Prevention Project\n says boys under the age of 18 are most vulnerable to being recruited into a gang. Some of the boys involved in local gangs are as young as 13 years old.\nServices will still be available for youth at OneRoof by appointment. But Dietrich-Bell said that just won't feel the same because drop-in services were often a first step to guiding troubled youth onto the right path.\n\"They would come to drop in and then it would be staff encouraging them, you know, do you need to see your housing worker? Do you need to get some laundry done? Now we're going to shift our focus and have the onus back on them to come to us when they need something and book an appointment for it.\"\nShe said when money is tight, they have to choose to serve the community's more immediate needs over preventative measures like the drop-in services.\n\"We have to just start to be a little bit more strategic with where those donation dollars can benefit us most between shelter beds or mental health and addiction services versus a drop in. I mean, it's no decision anybody ever wants to make, but looking at our priorities, we recognize that if we have to cut somewhere then sadly it has to be the drop-in area.\"\nThe drop-in services will officially be shut down on September 15.", "author": [{"name": "Aastha Shetty", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/author/aastha-shetty-1.6219746", "email": "aastha.shetty@cbc.ca", "about": "Aastha Shetty can be reached via email aastha.shetty@cbc.ca or by tweeting her at @aastha_shetty", "metadata": {"title": "CBC journalist"}}], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-06T08:00:00.532000", "date_modified": "2023-09-06T08:00:00.532000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He said he and Vasilije had argued, he blacked out, and then when he came out of it, he realized he had stabbed her. \nA total of 13 victim impact statements were submitted to the court on Wednesday.\nTodorovic told Justice Gerry Taylor her life has changed since her daughter's death. She has stopped being social, she goes grocery shopping late at night to avoid crowds, she cannot work full-time and she's lost friends who didn't know how to deal with her immense grief.\nTodorovic has two grandchildren and she said she loves them, but it also hurts to know her daughter Melinda will never get to be the mother she wanted to be.\n\"I'll never get to hold her babies,\" Todorovic said, breaking down into tears, which led to the court taking a 10-minute break. After the break, Crown Ashley Warne read the rest of Todorovic's statement.\n\"Melinda's death has changed me. The world now feels dark and unsafe to be a part of,\" Warne read from Todorovic's statement.\n\"Every single day is a struggle to get through,\" the statement said. \"I look at her photo every night and cry myself to sleep.\"\n'She was a light'\nNatalie Koebel said Vasilije was her best friend after they met in high school. She remembered Vasilije as being \"loving, forgiving, honest, kind\" and that \"Melinda had the loudest laugh, it was contagious.\"\n\"She was a light,\" Koebel told the court while looking at Hasan. \"You didn't just take Melinda's life away that night — you took her from each and every one of us.\"\nHasan wore a white T-shirt and black pants as he sat in the prisoner's box. During the victim impact statements, Hasan looked straight ahead or down at the floor and did not appear to look at any of the people speaking. A photo of Vasilije was displayed during the victim impact statements.\nChristina Vasilije, Melinda's sister, said she'll never forget the \"agonizing screams\" of her mother when she called to tell her Melinda had died.\nShe, too, spoke about how her sister had wanted to become a hairdresser, marry and start a family.\n\"Ager has robbed her of those opportunities,\" Christina Vasilije said.\n\"It has destroyed my family to pieces,\" she added. \"Ager did not think of anyone else in the moment … He has to live with the consequences of those actions, as do we all.\"\nMelinda Vasilije's mom and sister talked about how the 22-year-old was eager to start her career as a hairdresser, marry and have a family.\n \n(Instagram)\n2 months in U.S. before arrest\nHasan crossed the border to the U.S. after stabbing Vasilije and remained there for two months before he was arrested in San Antonio, Texas on July 11, 2017.\nDuring his trial, the jury heard how Hasan had been in contact with police during the two months prior to his arrest and how he had tried to work out some kind of agreement for how he would be treated if he turned himself in. \nThe jury did not hear about social media posts believed to have been made by Hasan on Instagram and the website Reddit offering his own version of events of what happened the night Vasilije died.\nBefore the victim impact statements were read out in court Wednesday, Crown attorney Brendan Thomas presented evidence to the judge that alleged Hasan made a fake account on Facebook. It's alleged he used the account while on the run in the U.S. to post on a Facebook page called \nJustice for Melinda\n and to message Vasilije's mother, Todorovic.\nAger Hasan, 30, of Hamilton crossed the border into the U.S. after he stabbed Vasilije and remained there for two months before he was arrested in Texas. During that time, he was in contact with police in Waterloo region.\n \n(Instagram)\nThe account used the name Lucas Mack. Evidence was presented to the judge that the account had been accessed from a phone found in Hasan's room in San Antonio following his arrest.\nThomas said one post on the \nJustice for Melinda\n Facebook page started out by saying, \"This is what happens when a whore dates a douche. Murder.\"\nThe post said Vasilije and Hasan had cheated on each other and made other disparaging comments about Vasilije while telling people \"don't let your son's [sic] be like him either.\"\nThe person behind the Lucas Mack account also sent a chat message to Todorovic on July 4, 2017.\n\"Just an outsider looking in. Sorry about what happened to your daughter. However it seems like it could have been avoided had you not let her stay in the apartment after he broke on [sic] the first time,\" the message to Vasilije's mother said.\n\"Partially your fault yes but I hope u put [sic] forgive yourself we all make mistakes this one however cost your daughter's life ... oh well you have other daughters right.\"\nThe message ended with a colon and half bracket, a smiling emoticon.\nTwo police officers testified about the Facebook posts and the cellphone the Crown said was used to access the Facebook account: Greg MacDonald, currently an OPP officer but who worked on the Hasan investigation when he was with the Waterloo Regional Police Service, and Det. Oliver Ammendolia who is a forensic analyst in the Waterloo Regional Police Service's cyber crime unit.\nAger Hasan found guilty of 2nd-degree murder in Kitchener woman's stabbing death\nEscape to U.S., social posts, counterfeit currency: What the jury didn't hear in the Ager Hasan murder trial\nDefence attorney Scott Reid argued the Facebook account could have been a case of an internet troll — someone who makes inflammatory comments or antagonizes people online for fun — or a case of catfishing, where someone creates a fake profile and tries to connect with others pretending to be someone they're not.\n\"You personally have no direct evidence that Mr. Hasan created that account?\" Reid asked MacDonald.\n\"Not in front of me, I don't,\" MacDonald responded.\nIn his cross-examination of Ammendolia, Reid said Hasan was staying in a \"flop house\" when in San Antonio, a residence where multiple people were staying. \nAmmendolia agreed with Reid it was possible someone else could have used Hasan's phone and posted on the Facebook page or sent the message to Todorovic.\nSentencing continues Thursday\nWednesday was the first of three days set aside for sentencing. Being found guilty of second-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 10 to 25 years. Justice Taylor will determine when Hasan will be eligible for parole.\nIt's expected the defence will present evidence on Thursday and Reid said in court on Wednesday that Hasan is expected to speak.\nFollowing that, the Crown and defence will give final submissions to the judge before Taylor makes his decision.", "author": [{"name": "Kate Bueckert", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/author/kate-bueckert-1.4289543", "email": "kate.bueckert@cbc.ca", "about": "Kate has been covering issues in southern Ontario for more than 15 years.

David Wake, offering insight into the world of Ontario's developers and how they interact with the government.\n\"Communication ... can take many forms. It is not confined to the spoken word,\" Wake wrote in the report that described the housing minister's chief-of-staff, Ryan Amato, receiving packages from developers and later seeking further information.\n\"I find that these actions were tantamount to Mr. Amato saying the words he had been careful not to say.\"\nASK CBC NEWS\nYour Greenbelt controversy questions answered\nHow developers influenced the Ford government to open up their Greenbelt land for housing\nWake found that then-housing minister Steve Clark violated ethics rules during the province's process of removing 15 sites from the Greenbelt to build 50,000 homes and adding land to the protected area elsewhere. Clark resigned days after the report while Amato resigned in mid-August, but denied wrongdoing.\nWake's investigation featured interviews with two prominent developers, Silvio De Gasperis and Michael Rice — neither responded to a request for comment from The Canadian Press. Amato's lawyer also did not respond to a request for comment.\nHighway 413 signalled shift in Greenbelt policy\nDe Gasperis, the CEO of TACC Group of Companies, had for decades wanted to develop homes on one of his properties — known as Cherrywood — but it was in the Greenbelt, Wake wrote.\nDe Gasperis owned the land in the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve in Pickering, Ont., even prior to the creation of the Greenbelt in 2005 and felt it had improperly been made part of the protected area. He took the province to court over the designation, but ultimately lost.\nThe developer brought up the property with Premier Doug Ford after the Progressive Conservatives won the June 2018 election, \"telling him Cherrywood is the perfect land for housing.\"\nFord told De Gasperis he couldn't do it.\n1,200 homes on prime farmland: What's known about the plan to develop the Greenbelt in Pickering, Ont.\nMysterious consultant known as 'Mr. X' in Greenbelt report ID'd as former Clarington mayor: sources\nThe premier did not touch the Greenbelt in his first term — he initially told developers in February 2018 that he planned to open up the area but backtracked during the election campaign.\nDe Gasperis nonetheless took note of the Progressive Conservatives' pledge to build Highway 413 north of Toronto, a route running through Greenbelt land.\n\"This suggested to him there might be an opportunity to revisit the government's Greenbelt policy,\" Wake wrote.\nWhen Ford won the 2022 election, De Gasperis set his sights on Amato, Clark's chief of staff.\nThe hamlet of Cherrywood, located in Pickering, Ont., inside the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve, on land that was removed from the Greenbelt last December.

Amato said he would take a look.\nCherrywood, barren of houses, was the \"biggest disappointment in his career,\" De Gasperis told Wake.\nDe Gasperis' daughter told the integrity commissioner she did not see an opportunity to raise Greenbelt removal requests with the province until the 2022 election, when she noticed Ford did not renew his commitment to not touch the area.\n\"From that silence, she saw an opening that it might be reconsidering that position,\" Wake wrote.\nMore Greenbelt land could be opened to development, new housing minister says\nOntario will 're-evaluate' sites in Greenbelt land swap as part of sweeping review, Ford says\nIn early October, Amato called Alana De Gasperis seeking more information. She asked if Cherrywood would be removed from the Greenbelt.\n\"The government is looking at everything at this moment and have not made any decisions,\" Amato told her.\nShe then asked if he could look at other properties.\n\"He didn't say yes, he didn't say no,\" she told the integrity commissioner.\nShe took that opportunity to tell Amato about three other sites: one in Richmond Hill, Ont., another in Vaughan, Ont., and one in Hamilton that TACC co-owned with a friend of her father's.\nShe heard little from Amato until Nov. 3, 2022, when he called her to deliver good news: those four parcels of land were coming out of the Greenbelt.\nFormer housing minister Steve Clark resigned the post on Labour Day, in the wake of the integrity commissioner's report.\n \n(Alex Lupul/CBC)\nAnother prominent developer gets land removed\nMichael Rice, another prominent land developer, was also at the same developers' dinner where Silvio De Gasperis had handed his Cherrywood package to Amato.\nRice told the integrity commissioner he thought it was likely the Greenbelt would be opened up, particularly after the government passed legislation giving the housing minister power to decide growth areas and reducing the role of conservation authorities.\n\"If, by 2022, a developer was not thinking about the Greenbelt opening up, 'they were asleep,\"' Rice, who leads the Rice Group of Companies, told Wake.\nIn December 2021, Rice had staff identify Greenbelt lands he could purchase and, by May 2022, he entered into an agreement to buy a 687-acre property in King Township, Ont., with partners for $80 million.\nOntario Housing Minister Steve Clark resigns amid Greenbelt land swap controversy\nOntario has a new housing minister. But the Greenbelt is still his problem\nThat deal closed on Sept. 15, 2022, the day after the dinner where Rice spoke briefly with Amato.\n\"If you guys are looking at the Greenbelt lands, I have something great that is the site you need to look at,\" Rice had told Amato, according to Wake.\nA few days later, Amato called Rice seeking more information. Amato then came to Rice's office to pick up an information package at the end of September.\nAmato's visit told Rice \"they were looking at the Greenbelt,\" the developer told Wake.\nA little more than a month later that land would no longer be in the Greenbelt.\nDays after Wake's report, Ford announced a review of all Greenbelt lands.

But with climate change making natural disasters more frequent, the government is looking to overhaul the program.\nThe program covers damage done to private homes that isn't covered under private insurance, along with damage to public buildings and infrastructure and evacuation costs. Ottawa provides the money but it's administered by provincial and territorial governments.\nCurious about logistics of getting home to Yellowknife? Here's what officials say\nWhat you should know about home insurance if you've been displaced by wildfires\nThe federal government's share of payments issued under the DFAA is determined by a formula that sees it pay a larger portion as expenses increase. Ottawa bears no burden if the damage amounts to less than $3.61 per capita in the affected province. The federal government's share can rise as high as 90 per cent for events causing damage amounting to more than $18 per capita.\nSince 1970, Ottawa has contributed nearly $8 billion to disaster recovery through the DFAA. According to Public Safety Canada, 73 per cent of that money was paid out in the last decade.\nOttawa provided more than $1 billion to B.C. to deal with the aftermath of the 2021 floods that displaced thousands of people and destroyed farmland in the province's Lower Mainland.\nA road is completely submerged during flooding in Abbotsford, B.C. on Friday, November 15, 2021.\n \n(Ben Nelms/CBC)\nThe federal government is also providing DFAA funding to Quebec and the Atlantic provinces to cope with the effects of post-tropical storm Fiona. A spokesperson for Public Safety Canada said those cost estimates are still being assessed.\nRalph Pentland, a retired federal public servant who worked on programs similar to the DFAA, said that unless Ottawa leverages the program to encourage the construction of more resilient infrastructure, it should expect to pay higher bills following future disasters.\n\"We could just go on and we could let these things increase and increase forever and we could have the federal government bail everybody out as a means of last resort, [but] that's going to be very expensive,\" he said.\nPentland's comments echo concerns flagged by \nan expert panel report on the DFAA\n written last year.

But last month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Canadians likely will find it harder to get insurance in future due to climate change.\n\"We are facing a changing world right now, a changing climate,\" he said. \"We've seen more and more intense weather events. Insurance is going to get more difficult for people to obtain.\"\nTrudeau was speaking in B.C.'s Central Okanagan region — another area devastated by wildfires this summer.\nPentland said the DFAA acts as a sort of \"free insurance\" program to backstop what private insurers won't cover. He argued that the federal government needs to start leveraging the program to encourage more construction that can resist extreme weather events.\n\"The objective of any insurance program should be to leverage better management,\" he said.\nTrudeau speaks to a West Kelowna resident after wildfires forced an evacuation of the region earlier this summer.\n \n(Maggie MacPherson/CBC)\nTrudeau acknowledged that more thought needs to go into rebuilding in the wake of natural disasters. \n\"There are a lot of things we need to do to be thoughtful and careful as we rebuild,\" he said. The prime minister said more emphasis needs to be placed on forest management and building resilient communities that can mitigate wildfire damage.\nAnne Kleffner, a professor of risk management and insurance at the University of Calgary, said recent disasters are forcing governments at all levels to rethink how they build infrastructure and where they let people build homes.\n\"This is kind of this watershed moment, where it's like everybody is waking up to the fact that we can't just try to repair and rebuild afterwards. We really have to build a more resilient sort of infrastructure,\" she said.\nAs haze lingers, Edmonton and Calgary break records for summer smoke\nNo reprieve for uninsured homeowners hit with storm damage from Fiona, says minister\nPublic Safety Canada said the government is undergoing a review of the DFAA with the aim of modernizing the program. But the current parameters are expected to remain in place until March 2025.\nJason Thistlethwaite, a University of Waterloo professor with expertise in climate change adaptation and risk mitigation, said the government should accelerate its review process.\n\"It is frustrating that we're losing out on opportunities right now to take advantage of those [expert panel] recommendations by reforming the DFAA,\" he said.\nWATCH | Yellowknife evacuation order to be lifted\nEvacuation order for Yellowknife expected to be lifted Wednesday at noon\n3 days ago\nDuration \n8:34\nCalgary Mayor Jyoti Gondek and Yellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty join Power and Politics to discuss their joint call for additional support to help residents return to the Northwest Territories. --\nThistlethwaite said Ottawa shouldn't wait for its review to be complete to start leveraging the program's funds to build more resilient infrastructure.\n\"This is a critical window when we could be rebuilding in ways that help prevent ... the same disasters from happening,\" he said.\nKleffner agreed that some urgency is called for but added the program's complexity means the government has to tread carefully.\n\"I think in principle sooner is definitely better.

There will be further debate before a final vote on the new policies on Saturday.\nThe policies are designed to inform the party's next election platform but Poilievre isn't required to campaign on what delegates endorse.\nWATCH: Conservatives dominate in the polls as Poilievre prepares for major convention: \n \nConservatives dominate in the polls as Poilievre prepares for major convention\n2 days ago\nDuration \n15:17\nRecent polling suggests the Conservatives have a clear path to a majority government in an election held in the near future. The Writ's Éric Grenier breaks down the latest numbers. Then, Conservative Party of Canada president Rob Batherson discusses the hot button policy proposals on the convention agenda.\nThese conventions have been a headache for previous leaders.\nAt the 2021 policy convention, Poilievre's predecessor, Erin O'Toole, promised action on the environment in a speech. The very next day, party delegates \nrejected a motion that declared climate change is real\n. As a result, O'Toole left the convention weakened by rampant internal discontent.\nThe challenge for Poilievre, party insiders and observers tell CBC News, is to keep members focused on the main task before them: cobbling together a winning coalition that can take down Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and end eight years of Liberal government.\nThe party can't be distracted by social issues that could be off-putting to swing voters, the insiders said.\nA policy to ban sex-selective abortions — a long-time demand of some anti-abortion activists in the party — was included initially in the list of policy proposals but was ultimately dumped from the final 55 that delegates will debate this week.\nIt's a sign that the Poilievre-led party doesn't want to be consumed by at least one divisive social issue.\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre holds a press conference on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday, Aug. 23, 2023.\n \n(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press )\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday, Poilievre steered clear of the more controversial proposals when asked which ones he's prepared to endorse.\n\"I'd rather let the members review the motions and propose what policy they want me to consider. And when they do, I'll consider it,\" Poilievre said.\n\"Leaders, of course, are never bound by convention resolutions but we do take them into consideration.\"\nIn an address to Conservative MPs and senators Thursday before the convention, Poilievre made no mention of the resolutions.\nThe party's focus, he said, should be on taking the fight directly to the prime minister he blames personally for the country's woes.\nThe cost of housing has doubled on Trudeau's watch, he said, and stubborn inflation has pushed up the cost of living, leaving the working class with big bills.\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre speaks to a crowded room of supporters at the Cymbria Lions Club in Rustico, P.E.I., on Wednesday night. \n \n(Kerry Campbell/CBC)\nPoilievre vowed again to \"axe the carbon tax,\" balance the budget through spending cuts and tie federal funding for municipalities to the number of building permits they approve every year.\n\"The good news is, life was not like this in Canada before Justin Trudeau and it will not be like this after he's gone,\" Poilievre said to applause from his caucus.\nSpeaking to reporters on the sidelines of this Conservative gathering, some MPs said the resolutions are distraction.\n\"I haven't even read this resolution,\" Alberta MP Stephanie Kusie said of a proposed transgender policy.\n\"I haven't seen it,\" said Ontario MP Karen Vecchio. \"We're focused on issues that matter to Canadians. Let's not kid ourselves, we're doing really well.\"\nAnother Alberta MP, Michelle Rempel Garner, said she respects the \"rights and dignity\" of all Canadians, including those in the LGBTQ community.\n\"My first concern is with Canadians who are struggling in my community. The government and Parliament has a lot of work to do to address the affordability crisis,\" Rempel Garner said.\n\"I mean, at every convention in every party you have different resolutions that you look and say, 'Really?'\" Saskatchewan MP Kevin Waugh said when asked about the policy proposals.\n\"As MPs we say, 'Hmm. That's interesting. How would you put that into a policy?\"\nA Conservative source close to Poilievre who spoke to CBC News on background said the party brass isn't as concerned about the inevitable Liberal attacks on Conservative social policy — attacks that tripped up past leaders like Andrew Scheer and O'Toole. \nConservatives launch massive ad campaign amid surge in polls\nAs ambassadors seek answers from Poilievre, Tory caucus offers foreign policy hints\nIn 2019, for example, Liberals raised Scheer's past opposition to same-sex marriage. In 2021, Trudeau hammered O'Toole for his more permissive stance on firearms while also suggesting the abortion debate could be reopened with the Tories in power.\nPoilievre insisted during his leadership campaign that a government led by him would not introduce any new abortion legislation, the source said, and some more moderate voters are also uneasy about the pace of change with trans and gender issues.\n\"Pierre is adept at swatting away Liberal fearmongering,\" the source said.\n\"Plus, some voters are tired of all the 'woke' talk that comes from this Liberal government. We're fine having some of these conversations.\"\nCanadians want change, says party president \nRob Batherson, the Conservative Party president, said the party is bracing for the Liberals to rely on the \"usual fear and scare tactics\" to weaken Poilievre's standing among more moderate voters.\nWith Trudeau on the defensive, the Tories are expecting their opponent to go negative, he said.\n\"I think Canadians will see through those tactics and they'll focus on the fact that everything has gotten appreciably worse over the last eight years,\" Batherson told CBC's \nPower & Politics\n.\n\"We're increasingly confident that Canadians are looking for a change in government, and they're certainly tired of Justin Trudeau.\"\nCanadians are looking for a change in government after eight years of Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, says Rob Batherson, the Conservative party president. \n \n(Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press)\nAmong the socially conservative policies that delegates will consider in Quebec is a proposed ban on gender-affirming care for minors.\nThe proposal, backed by delegates from the B.C. riding of North Okanagan-Shuswap, is designed to \"protect children\" by \"prohibiting life altering medicinal or surgical interventions on minors under 18 to treat gender confusion or dysphoria.\" The policy mimics similar policies enacted by conservative Republican governments in the U.S.\nFor many social conservatives, trans issues have supplanted abortion as the top issue.\nIn that vein, there's also a proposal from the Alberta riding of Edmonton Strathcona that would make it party policy to demand \"women-only spaces,\" to ensure that women have \"safety, dignity and privacy\" in places like prisons, shelters, locker rooms and washrooms.\nThey also want \"women-only\" categories in sports and for scholarships — a proposal that's designed to exclude transgender women. Under the policy, a woman would be defined as a \"female person\" in the Conservative constitution.\nProposal aims to promote 'bodily autonomy'\nThis push follows the lead of some U.S. states that have enacted similar policies after transgender swimmer Lia Thomas won a women's NCAA national championship. That victory ignited a political debate about the acceptability of trans athletes in elite sport.\nDelegates from Edmonton Strathcona also want to do away with \"forced political, cultural or ideological training of any kind\" that is a \"precondition of employment or practice,\" an apparent reference to diversity training in some workplaces.\nWhile some delegates are eager to restrict the rights of trans people, others say they want to promote \"bodily autonomy.\"\nDelegates from the Quebec riding of Repentigny say people should have more say on what goes into their bodies — a policy born of opposition to Ottawa's past policy of requiring certain public servants to get a COVID-19 shot or face the prospect of losing their jobs.\n\"Health professionals must disclose an uncensored risk benefit analysis for any treatment (including vaccines) while protecting patient privacy. No constitutional right shall be restricted for refusing medical treatments,\" the policy proposal reads.\nA man is silhouetted walking past a Conservative Party logo.\n \n(Darren Calabrese/Canadian Press)\nAs for medical assistance in dying (MAID), a proposal from delegates from the Ontario riding of Thunder Bay—Superior North, which describes the practice as \"euthanasia,\" aims to roll back what's currently on offer.\nThey want the practice stopped for people who are not terminally ill. And they want a ban on the service for people who have mental health issues.\nJ.P. Lewis is a professor of political science at the University of New Brunswick Saint John and the author of The Blueprint: Conservative parties and their impact on Canadian politics.\nSingh launches broadside against Poilievre as New Democrats prepare for Parliament's return\nLewis said the convention is a delicate balancing act for the leader. Poilievre can't be seen as marginalizing the grassroots by denying talk on hot topics.\nHe also can't get caught up in fractious debates that don't play well in a general election.\n\"These conventions are a real test for a leader. But Poilievre has more room to fail. He's had a consistent lead over Trudeau in the polls,\" he said. \"He's got such momentum because there's a tremendous amount of voter fatigue out there.\n\"Fatigue — that's a powerful force in Canadian politics.\"", "author": [{"name": "John Paul Tasker", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/author/john-paul-tasker-1.3389288", "email": "john.tasker@cbc.ca", "about": "J.P.

Her schoolmate at Elgin Street Public School, 11-year-old Sally Eves, has class in a portable. She said the air conditioner there is broken.\nEves and her friends found creative ways to endure.

The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) said about 70 per cent of its schools are either fully air conditioned or have air conditioning in the classrooms, while the Ottawa Catholic School Board (OCSB) said 53 of its 84 schools are totally air conditioned.\nThe Catholic board also said every portable classroom in its schools has air conditioning.\n'Wasting away' in Spanish class\nSpokespeople for both boards said all of their schools have at least one air-conditioned area for students to cool down, whether it's a gym, library or office.\nEves said she sought refuge in her school's library.

I couldn't give an exact temperature, but everyone's sweating. It's hard to concentrate. It's just really terrible, a terrible experience.\"\nKirkey, who taught for more than two decades, has noticed heat can affect student learning. Unmitigated heat waves lead to \"pretty brutal and miserable\" conditions in some classrooms, she said.\n\"It's challenging, for sure, especially to keep students motivated and focused,\" said Kirkey. \nTeachers try to be flexible, she said, breaking up lessons and pushing back tests until cooler weather returns.\nOttawa Morning\n3:57\nSome students sweating out heat wave in sweltering schools\nStudents have come back to school in the midst of a heat wave and are finding ways to adapt during class and recess.\nDarcy Knoll, a spokesperson for the OCDSB, said facilities department staff watch weather forecasts and modify ventilation systems \"to maximize the benefit of cooler temperatures during the night.\" Schools may also use portable fans, he said, and the board encourages principals to come up with their own strategies to provide relief.\nStudents are encouraged to drink fluids, wear lightweight clothing, seek shade, wear a hat and use sunscreen where direct sun exposure cannot be avoided, according to Knoll. Strenuous outdoor exercise is also discouraged.\nRader put that same advice in her own terms.\n\"Don't run a lot,\" she said. \"If you're playing a tag game, don't chase each other very [fast]. Just jog or even walk.\"\nSome parents keep kids home\nAt OCSB, spokesperson Sharlene Hunter said some classes might be moved to common areas or gyms if heat becomes \"problematic.\" Teachers might adjust schedules, including by moving outdoor activities to cooler times or giving students more water breaks.\nShe said parents and guardians of children with heat-related medical conditions should do what's best for their children. \n\"If they feel it is necessary to keep their child at home, we encourage them to do so,\" she said.\nLaura McCullough did precisely that.

Symptoms include headaches, nausea, dizziness, burning eyes and drowsiness — and elevated levels can cause illness or death before people even realize the gas is present.\nProperty owners can choose to install combination alarms that can detect smoke and carbon monoxide.\n \n(Dayne Patterson/CBC)\nAccording to the province\n, an average of 1,200 CO incidents were reported annually to SaskEnergy from 2018 to 2020. The Saskatchewan Coroners Service recorded 16 deaths from accidental CO poisoning from 2015 to 2019.\nResidents of a Saskatoon apartment building\n had a close call\n with CO poisoning in 2021. A doctor's intuition was key in saving lives, after he suspected CO exposure when he examined a patient in the emergency room. The doctor contacted the fire department, which sent a team to the apartment building and discovered high CO levels.\nFirefighters got everyone to leave the building and 29 people were sent to hospital. There were no fatalities. The CO came from a leaking boiler, and there were no CO detectors in the building.\nSaskatoon doctor's intuition leads to rescue of 29 people poisoned with carbon monoxide\nCameron Choquette, CEO of the Saskatchewan Landlord Association, spoke to the city committee on Tuesday in favour of the fire department's proposed plans for enforcement. \n\"There were some very scary situations in Saskatoon a few years ago related to CO alarms in rental properties, and we know how important those life safety devices are,\" he said.\n\"That notice to remedy is a really key piece of the enforcement scheme here, because it gives the rental housing provider or the property owner the opportunity to comply, prior to a cost being assessed for a ticket.\"\nChoquette said the association has been actively campaigning for landlords to install CO detectors since the new regulations were put in place in July of last year.\nThe regulations say that every residential property in Saskatchewan is required to have CO monitors installed in or just outside every bedroom and in rooms where there is a fuel-fired appliance such as a natural gas stove, fireplace, furnace or water heater. The alarms need to be hard-wired, plug-in or have lithium batteries and must have a 10-year expiry period or longer.", "author": [{"name": "Hannah Spray", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatoon/author/hannah-spray-1.6683399", "email": "", "about": "Hannah Spray works as a reporter and editor for CBC Saskatoon.", "metadata": {"title": "Reporter/Editor"}}], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-06T17:30:02.188000", "date_modified": "2023-09-06T17:30:02.188000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The two have been inseparable since their first year of high school together.\nPurchasing the tickets involved codes and online lineups for a desperate shot at attending. The whole convoluted process and my daughter's willingness to go through it made me wonder what about Taylor Swift makes her \narguably the most successful pop star of our time\n.\nSo much of being a \"girl dad\" has been a learning process.\nGrowing up with brothers, Friedland wasn't initially sure how to be a father to a baby girl.\n \n(Submitted by Nathan Friedland)\nWhen my fiancé, Mara, and I were looking at our first ultrasound images, we had decided we didn't want to know the sex of our baby. But as a nursing student, I still searched the image for a sign.\nCripes, what if this is a girl?\n I thought. We were thrilled to be pregnant, but I knew nothing about raising a daughter. My parents raised me and my three brothers, so I didn't have an example to follow. Would I be a good dad?\nI started working full time as a nurse not long after Kayla's birth, and that's when I began to see just how differently men were treated compared to women. When I approached a patient with my stethoscope around my neck, most assumed I was a doctor. Along with that assumption came more respect than what my mostly female nursing colleagues would get from their patients under the same circumstances.\nDoctors would treat me better when I said something in a meeting or called one of them on the phone. I saw how women in nursing were often disrespected by male doctors and even their patients, but I was treated with more deference for doing the exact same job at the exact same level. There were times that I wished I said something, but I never did. Sure, I've heard a few homophobic quips about being a male nurse, but it was nothing like the volume of sexism my female colleagues faced every day.\nWas it a man's world even in a female-dominated profession? Was this the world Kayla was going to live in?\nFriedland, left, with his daughter Kayla when she was four years old.\n \n(Submitted by Nathan Friedland)\nAs Kayla grew older and went to high school, I noticed that the school's dress code was arguably sexist. Female skin was highly regulated but males could wear almost whatever they wanted except for a baseball cap. She noticed this too.\nAfter several dress code \"violations,\" Hailey wrote a dynamite letter to her teachers arguing that the code was unfair to women. It resulted in a meeting with the principal, but then nothing changed. By not altering the code, this male principal gave the impression to Hailey and Kayla that it is a \"man's world,\" even if they tried to fight it. But I was still proud of Hailey for standing up for herself.\nA few months later, Kayla and I were walking through a busy shopping centre. \"Never trust a man,\" I told her.\nTaylor Swift's new Eras tour film is the latest lesson in 'Swift-onomics'\nWhy would I say such a horrendous thing to my daughter while we were buying clothes? As the dad of a daughter looking at all the signs and flashy posters in the mall, all I saw was the portrayal of women as sex objects.\nAt that time, my observations about men were compounded with what I saw at work. Males ogling females in a place where females strongly outnumbered them. Males hitting on females even though these men were married and, even worse, men using their positions of power to objectify women. Americans had \nelected a president who on tape bragged\n, \"You can do anything\" when pursuing a woman and he said to grab them by their genitals.\nWere female-dominated positions, like nurses and teachers, doomed to be always asking for better conditions yet to never receive them?\nFriedland, centre, has seen his daughter Kayla, right, and her best friend Hailey, left, grow up together since they started high school.\n \n(Submitted by Nathan Friedland)\nThese memories came back to me with a newfound focus when Kayla suggested I listen to Swift's \nThe Man\n and watch the\n Barbie\n movie. I thought the song sounded generic, but Kayla urged me to listen closely to the lyrics and watch the music video, which spelled out how much easier it is to be a man in this world than a woman.\nIs Swift so popular because people are tired of the status quo and want change? Is it any coincidence that \nThe Man\n and \nBarbie\n have similar themes? That men and women should be treated equally, and that it is unfair men have it easier?\nKayla has grown into a remarkable young woman. She's a brilliant writer, a college graduate with a job, and she will be starting university this winter. She's assertive, as is Hailey, and I'm certain that as they get older, the two of them will have even more of a positive impact on this world than they've already had.\nThe two of them at 19 years old have already accomplished far more than I did at that age. In fact, my nursing career did not begin until I was 32. Was I allowed to take such time to find myself because I am a man?\nNow that I'm in my 50s, I desperately want to grow old enough to see how Kayla and Hailey turn out in a world where one woman's popularity has perhaps made them believe that it does not have to be a man's world after all.\nAnd in addition to being a proud \"girl dad,\" I'm now also a dedicated Swiftie.\nDo you have a compelling personal story that can bring understanding or help others?

As of June 30, he added, the party has whittled that down to 27 cents.\nThat's the first time it's ever been below the 30-cent threshold, he added — something he attributes to reduced costs at the call centres that solicit funds from party members.\nStaley said Poilievre is the party's best fundraiser because his low-cost appeals on social media, which typically feature clips of his question period attacks on the government, bring in a lot of money. \nPoilievre will address convention delegates in a prime-time address Friday night.

She was stabbed 47 times by her former boyfriend, Ager Hasan, 27 of those times in her neck and she had six stab wounds to her chest.\nBeing found guilty of second-degree murder carries an automatic life sentence with no chance of parole for 10 to 25 years. \nWednesday is the first of three days where family and friends will give victim impact statements before the judge decides how long Hasan must serve before he's eligible for parole.\nHasan was found guilty of second-degree murder in May 2023. He never denied that he stabbed Vasilije, but he claimed it was in self defence. He claimed the two had argued, he blacked out, and then when he came out of it, he realized he had stabbed her.\nDetails of case\nThe jury knew it took two months to arrest Hasan, but not the reasons why. They jury was also told Hasan sent Vasilije's phone a text at 3:39 a.m. on the night of the incident saying he was glad they had worked things out and it was good to see her, even though he very likely knew she was dead.\nThe jury heard that after stabbing Vasilije, Hasan drove across the border to the U.S. but they were told to discount that information in their deliberations.\nThe jury was not told that it's believed Hasan posted to social media, such as Reddit, where he outlined his own version of events of what transpired in Vasilije's apartment the night she died. \nAger Hasan, 30, of Hamilton was found guilty in May 2023 of second-degree murder.

The source provided the suspect's description, first name, address and vehicle information.\nA traffic stop was initiated and found the vehicle's license plates were stolen in Arkansas. Hasan was in the front passenger seat. A search of the vehicle found Hasan had approximately $600 in counterfeit $20 bills. Due to the outstanding warrant for his arrest in Canada, no U.S. federal counterfeit charges were pursued, the Secret Service said in a press release at the time.\nThat information wasn't brought before the jury, Justice Gerry Taylor explained, because there's no normal way to behave after a crime.\nHasan had admitted to killing Vasilije — he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter at the start of the trial, a plea the Crown rejected — and Taylor told the members of the jury they couldn't find him guilty on his after-the-fact conduct alone.\nAfter Hasan was found guilty, Vasilije's family was overwhelmed with emotion in the courtroom and declined to speak with reporters.\nRead more of CBC Kitchener-Waterloo's coverage of this case:\nEscape to U.S., social posts, counterfeit currency: What the jury didn't hear in the Ager Hasan murder trial\nAger Hasan found guilty of 2nd-degree murder in Kitchener woman's stabbing death\nAccused killer Ager Hasan 'a danger to the community,' says Texas judge\nHasan 'had difficulty accepting' relationship end with Melinda Vasilije, say court documents\nHamilton man faces second-degree murder charges in death of Kitchener woman", "author": [{"name": "Kate Bueckert", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/author/kate-bueckert-1.4289543", "email": "kate.bueckert@cbc.ca", "about": "Kate has been covering issues in southern Ontario for more than 15 years.

He said if post-secondary institutions aren't able to provide housing, it puts further strain on private rental markets with high rents and low vacancies. \nAlso last month, federal housing minister Sean Fraser suggested the government \nput a cap\n on the number of international students, or work with universities and colleges to ensure they're providing enough housing.\nFinding housing in Hamilton an 'awful' and 'stressful' task for incoming international students\nWe're welcoming record numbers of international students.

Maureen Wilson (Ward 1) raised concerns about students finding housing in Hamilton at a committee meeting in August. \n\"Because universities and colleges have not built sufficient residences, students of various means are subjected to some not very nice conditions in the private rental market,\" Wilson said.\n\"I'm looking for some assurance... that students who have moved to Hamilton or from Hamilton are not forgotten,\" she said.\nVan Koughnett said blaming post-secondary institutions for not building enough housing or accepting too many international students is \"completely off base,\" at least in the Hamilton context.\nAlong with trying to build Lincoln Alexander Hall, the university is anticipating fewer undergraduate international students this school year than in previous years, comprising about 15 per cent of the student population, he said.\nHowever, there will be more graduate-level international students this year than in previous years, said spokesperson  Wade Hemsworth. To accommodate them, the university is set to open part of its new graduate residence at 10 Bay St. S., adding 250 beds this fall and another 350 in January. \nColleges seeing increased demand for housing\nOther post-secondary institutions in the Hamilton and Niagara region say they're also on track to increase on-campus housing. \nAt Mohawk College, nearly 800 students inquired about on-campus housing for this school year, but with only one residence building at the Fennell campus, space is limited to 340 beds, said spokesperson Bill Steinburg. \nHowever, the college has been \"proactively\" trying to address the shortage and is considering leasing homes for 300 more students off-campus, he said.

It recently announced plans to build accommodations for 1,000 students in the next four years, which would triple its on-campus housing. \n\"The housing shortage issue is broad and complex, and it would be inaccurate to single out students – including International students – as the cause,\" she said. \n\"In fact, students are among the most impacted by the shortage of affordable housing in our communities.\"\nMeanwhile, Brock University in St. Catharines, Ont., is seeing a decrease in enrolment of both domestic and international students, with over 5,800 in 2019 and 5,000 in 2023, said spokesperson Maryanne St. Denis. \nIt currently has more residence spots than students. ", "author": [{"name": "Samantha Beattie", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/author/samantha-beattie-1.5992528", "email": "", "about": "Samantha Beattie is a reporter for CBC Hamilton.

At the time, David wasn't yet born and his mother was pregnant with his sister. \nHis parents left everything behind because David's father, through his work in film and photography, had run afoul of a Soviet-controlled government. He could stay and remain under the thumb of a regime that stifled free expression or escape to Canada where his family could live free. \n\"They risked everything to provide freedom and opportunity to my sister and I,\" said Strauzz. \"Now I'm here painting an ode that honours their legacy and their struggle.\" \nAfter the family landed in London, Ont., David's father went to work for General Motors. David would go on to graduate from H.B. Beal Secondary School and OCAD in Toronto while building a career as a mixed-media artist with a specialty in portraiture and large outdoor murals, often done in spray paint. \nWATCH | David Strauzz explains why he's painting a mural in London:\n \nLondon-born artist returns to honour immigrant parents with mural\n2 days ago\nDuration \n0:39\nMixed-media artist David Strauzz was born in London, Ont., but now calls Prague, Czech Republic, home. He returned to the Forest City to paint a mural in honour of his parents and other immigrants who have made sacrifices for their families. The mural is painted on the north wall of the Benz Gallery on Adelaide Street North.\nWhile his parents gave Strauzz and his sister a \"beautiful life\" in Canada, it came at a great sacrifice. His parents had to struggle to make it in a country where they didn't speak the language and had no family support. \n\"The communication with our relatives in Czechoslovakia was nonexistent,\" said Strauzz. \"The letters that we received were opened and taped because the secret service over there was filtering and monitoring everything. It makes me want to cry. I didn't have any relationship with my grandparents and aunts and uncles.\" \nInterestingly, Strauzz now lives in the Czech Republic, which he call a \"great country,\" not the oppressive place his parents felt compelled to flee. He returned to London this week to paint the mural on the north wall of the Benz Gallery on Adelaide Street North. \nThe painting is a tribute to Strauzz's parents but it doesn't depict them specifically because he wants the work to stand as a tribute to everyone who fled their native country to give their families a better life. \n \n(Andrew Lupton/CBC)\nBy design, Strauzz's mural isn't an exact depiction of his parents. He wants the subject of the work to be a bit generic so it can stand as a tribute to anyone and everyone who made a similar journey for the sake of their families, whether they fled Nazi Germany, the Pinochet regime in Chile or, more recently, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. \nStrauzz lost both his parents to cancer; his father's death came last year. \n\"One half of the mural is an ode to my parents but also to all the immigrants who came to Canada and struggled in the first few years to learn the language and be part of the Canadian culture and be part of this beautiful, free country,\" he said. \nStrauzz says he enjoys the unique challenges of working outside and estimates he'll go through about 50 spray cans by the time the work is complete.\n \n(Andrew Lupton/CBC)\nStrauzz describes his work as \"urban impressionism.\" The figures appear in cloudy washes of colour that at first glance seem to have no definition. Only after looking for a few seconds does the detail and shape of the faces become apparent. Again, this is deliberate. \n\"It takes some patience, it takes some perspective to see who I've painted,\" he said. \"It's no different than when we meet people, we might through social media think that we know everything about who we meet but it takes time for us to truly understand who they are. That's what I'm trying to promote, patience and understanding.\" \nStrauzz hopes to have his mural completed by Thursday, though working outdoors means he's at the mercy of the weather.

The man was pronounced dead in hospital within an hour of the shooting.\nFamily members \npreviously identified the man killed as Andrew Geisler.\n His sister and father told CBC News that Geisler needed help because he suffered from depression and anxiety and struggled with alcoholism.\n\"He needed help.

The man refused to drop the knife when asked to do so repeatedly, and advanced on the officer, the police watchdog said.\nThe man was twice shot while within six metres of the officer, according to the SIU. \nMartino says in the report that the use of lethal force by the police officer was justified because he was defending himself from a knife attack.\n\"On my assessment of the evidence, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the [subject official] committed a criminal offence in connection with the complainant's death,\" he says.\n\"The weapon the complainant was wielding was capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm and death, and the complainant seemed intent on using it against the [subject official] and had neared to within striking distance of the officer at the time of the shooting.\"\nToronto police are pictured here at the scene of the fatal shooting in May.\n \n(CBC)\nAccording to the SIU, an off-duty paramedic flagged down a police officer after seeing a man in distress in the parking lot.

She said all the \"green\" reasons — such as reduced carbon emissions — are only part of the equation. In many cases, tenants don't have or want a vehicle, particularly in urban areas.\n\"We can often demonstrate there isn't a market need for that much parking,\" said Savoie. \"I think municipalities often set parking spaces higher than what the market commands.\" \nNot everyone is a fan of setting aside less space for parking. As part of the consultation process for 1515 Trossacks Ave., the city sought feedback from the neighbourhoods. \nSeen as wasted space, London has 29 acres of surface parking: Here are the 10 largest lots\nSome said they're concerned about spillover street parking on Trossacks and the surrounding streets.\nAnother argument against reduced parking is that it works best in cities with robust transit systems. The Trossacks apartments will be right beside a bus stop on the London Transit Commission's Route 25, which runs along Fanshawe Park Road on its route between Masonville Place mall and Fanshawe College. On weekdays buses come about every 30 minutes.\nTransit improvements a 'missing piece'\nThe proposed six-storey apartment building will be located on the green spaces seen behind this bus shelter at the corner of Fanshawe Park Road East and Trossacks Avenue. \n \n(Andrew Lupton/CBC)\nAlex Wray is a PhD candidate at Western University's department of geography and environment. He also studies planning. And while he supports cuts to parking requirements for new buildings, he said improvements to transit service remain a missing piece of the planning puzzle in London.\n\"To get people out of cars you have to have 10-minute service, which no corridor in London has,\" said Wray. \"What the city and LTC need to do is figure out where we're going to set a level of service and funding it properly.\"\nWray points out that other active transportation improvements are needed in that section of north London, including making the Fanshawe Park Road bike lane continuous and linking it to the Thames Valley Parkway.\nBigger transit ask coming\nCoun. Jerry Pribil, who sits on the LTC board and whose ward includes Trossacks Ave., said it's \"a perfect infill project\" for the area.\nHe also agrees transit funding needs to increase so the service is frequent enough to get residents to ditch their vehicles.\n\"We need to increase the frequency and decrease the waiting time and I think our goal should be 10 to 15 minutes [between buses],\" said Pribil. \nLess parking can mean more housing\nThe proposed building for 1515 Trossacks Ave. includes parking for 60 residents with 100 units in the building. Some neighbours are concerned there will be 'spillover parking' on the nearby streets.\n \n(Andrew Lupton/CBC)\nThe strongest argument in favour of reduced parking spaces might be one the property's owner Daniel Boyer puts forward: that it makes the structure cheaper to build and in turn more cost effective for the renter. \n\"Reduced parking means more density in the building, which to me outweighs any negatives,\" said Boyer.\nHe said the LTC board and senior staff have been going over their options and will be making a case for increases to service levels when the city's budget process gets underway later this year. ", "author": [{"name": "Andrew Lupton", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/author/andrew-lupton-1.3963219", "email": "", "about": "Andrew Lupton is a B.C.-born journalist, father of two and a north London resident with a passion for politics, photography and baseball.

He said he expects construction to get underway on those sites by 2025.\nAt the same time, Calandra said, he will also be carrying out a wider review of all protected lands, suggesting more areas could be opened for housing construction. \nHamilton chief planner says ex-Greenbelt land won't be housing ready for years\nFor some residents, it was too soon to accept development will actually happen on the three rural sites in Hamilton. During a question-and-answer session with staff, residents called on the city to fight the land removal in court, use stalling tactics to prolong the approval process or abandon negotiations altogether. \nThe auditorium was filled and as many as 200 other people were turned away. \n \n(Samantha Beattie/CBC)\n\"I don't see any benefits that we're going to reap by going along with this facilitation process,\" said Lucia Iannantuono, who ran for the Green Party in the last provincial byelection. \"What is stopping us from saying, 'This is a sham?'\" \nHamilton resident Patrick Antila voiced opinion about Premier Doug Ford.  \n\"The reason that he is overriding all of us is because he doesn't care, he doesn't care what we think,\" Antila said. \"We're not going to relent until the Greenbelt is not developed.\"\nGreenbelt landowner says Ontario process not fair\nRobichaud said it's better for staff to secure some benefits for the community than walk away and not get anything out of the development.\nRegardless of whether the city reaches an agreement with developers, the housing minister has the power to issue a Ministerial Zoning Order (MZO) to allow development to proceed, Robichaud said. That order overrides any municipal laws — including existing housing restrictions on the Book Road and White Church lands due to noise from the nearby airport.\nThe minister also doesn't have to approve community benefits, Robichaud said.\n\"I would hope though if there was an agreement between the landowner and municipality, they would honour that,\" he said.\nSome Hamilton councillors say they'll stand in front of bulldozers to stop Greenbelt development\nCBC Investigates\nDevelopers bought Hamilton Greenbelt property a month before Ontario revealed plans to open it up for housing\nSome property owners of Greenbelt land were in the audience at the public meeting, including farmer and veterinarian Tom Nugent. \nHe told city staff that mistakes were made when the Greenbelt was originally formed in 2005. His land off of Twenty Road was added despite it being unsuitable for farming and already connected to city infrastructure, he said. \n\"Now, the Ford government is not correcting this mistake, but is favouring rich developers who recently bought up the land in the Greenbelt,\" wrote Nugent in a flyer he handed out to audience members. \"Please stand up for democracy and accountability .. and finally correct this mistake.\" ", "author": [{"name": "Samantha Beattie", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/author/samantha-beattie-1.5992528", "email": "", "about": "Samantha Beattie is a reporter for CBC Hamilton.

Centre for Disease Control defines an \noutbreak in acute care\n as the \"occurrence or suspicion\" of linked cases acquired in the health-care facility within a 10 day period, with more cases or more severe illness than expected based on the circulating virus. Whether or not to declare an outbreak falls under the discretion of the local medical health officer or their designate. \nIn comparison, neighbouring Alberta has reported nine COVID-19 outbreaks as of Sept. 5, while Ontario reports 101 ongoing outbreaks as of Aug. 26. Some schools and hospitals have also \nreinstated mask mandates in the U.S.\n, and the\n Ottawa Hospital\n will follow suit this fall.\nEnhanced measures\nAccording to health-care workers at Saanich Peninsula Hospital, the 18 cases were all detected within a week and a half. Hospital and public health communication about the situation, however, does not include the word \"outbreak\". \nDuring past COVID-19 outbreaks, Unger said, this high number of COVID-19 patients would have triggered signage throughout the hospital letting them know about the situation. \nNow, a photo sent to CBC News of handwritten signage on the door of an inpatient unit at the hospital reads \"enhanced measures are in place for increased respiratory illness on unit,\" and recommends masks with eye protection. The sign does not mention COVID-19.\n\"When front-line staff get emails and notices and you only see signage around the hospital that says 'We're under enhanced measures,' I think unfortunately many people don't understand that. It doesn't prick up their ears to think about that; they're likely to just skim over that email or not read it in detail,\" Unger said.\n\"The measures to control the spread of [the virus] that should happen as a result of enhanced measures don't get instituted as fully as they would if the term 'outbreak' was used.\"\nAccording to an Aug. 23 email to staff seen by CBC News, which emphasizes there is \"\nnot \nan outbreak,\" the enhanced measures for a unit of the hospital include:\n   \nUniversal mask and eye protection for staff on the unit.\n   \nIncreased cleaning requested.\n   \nClosing doors to the unit, with signage directing visitors to the desk.\n   \nVisitors should wear a surgical mask on the unit.\n  \nNeither the BCCDC nor the provincial health ministry has answered CBC questions including how many acute care facilities in B.C. currently have these steps in place, in time for publication. \nA panoramic shot of Saanich Peninsula Hospital, where COVID-19 has spread quickly among patients, who are mostly seniors.\n \n(Mike McArthur/CBC)\nThe impact of COVID in hospital\nIn general, COVID-19 cases are \nmuch less severe\n than earlier in the pandemic because of immunization rates and previous infection. But when a patient at Saanich Peninsula Hospital is infected with COVID-19, it almost always leads to a longer hospital visit, said Unger.\n\"They develop other complications from COVID or they're just weaker,\" Unger said. \"It unfortunately adds complexity to their care and will almost certainly prolong their hospital stay which impacts overall burden on the health-care system and our hospital capacity rates.\"\nLower capacity means more patients seen in crowded hallways, less space for infection prevention measures, and a vicious cycle of virus spread that leaves more people at risk of severe illness and death.\nAnalysis\nCOVID keeps evolving, but so does our immunity. Are we now at a 'stalemate' with this virus?\nAnalysis\nCOVID keeps evolving, but so does our immunity. Are we now at a 'stalemate' with this virus?\nDr. Anthony Fong, an ER physician and general practitioner who has worked in every B.C. health authority over the past few months, foresees a difficult fall ahead with a spike in COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses coinciding with relaxed public health measures.\n\"Over the past several months, I've noticed that health-care workers are masking less than before,\" Fong said. \"Some health authorities have been pretty much making masking optional during patient care.\"\n\"[Masking is] 100 per cent mandatory as far as I'm concerned,\" Fong said.\n\"Especially [because] you have no idea which patient is going to end up being vulnerable to the disease, who has a compromised immune system or who has high risk past medical history that makes them really at risk.\" \nWATCH | What to know about COVID-19 this fall: \nWhat you should know about COVID-19 this fall\n7 days ago\nDuration \n3:46\nInfectious diseases specialist Dr. Zain Chagla speaks with Ian Hanomansing about what he’s seeing with COVID-19 cases in Canada this fall and goes over the latest advice around booster shots.\nManaging risks including long COVID\nInformation about the virus and its spread needs to be more readily available to the public particularly as public health measures are relaxed, said Caroline Colijn, an epidemiologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.\n\"We're being asked to manage our own risk but it's hard to do that …without good information,\" said Colijn, a Canada 150 Research Chair in Mathematics for Evolution, Infection and Public Health.\n\"I think the public does need to be informed of what's going on with COVID, about the risk of COVID infection and also the risk from COVID infection.\"\n'The pandemic is not over': Experts expect a surge in COVID cases this fall\nColijn said more information and conversations are needed about the risk of longer term outcomes like long COVID, cardiovascular complications, and diabetes after contracting COVID-19.\nA report from \nCanada's chief science advisor\n in May stated that long COVID \"has the potential to become a mass-disabling event.\" As of August 2022 more than 1.4 million people in Canada — about 15 per cent of those who contracted COVID-19 — said they experienced symptoms three months or longer after being infected. \nThis number may be an underestimation, according to the report, because of the lack of a clear definition for the disease and low availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests.\n\"We don't really have community testing and we don't have reported cases at the community level, so we don't really have a good lens on how much COVID is circulating in the general population,\" Colijn said.\nTop medical experts call for national inquiry into Canada's COVID-19 'failures'\nAccording to Unger, before this recent spike in cases, patients were not tested regularly for COVID-19. Things are starting to change.\n\"Part of that was [because] cases were decreasing, illnesses weren't as severe, everyone kind of got feeling like the pandemic is over,\" Unger said. \n\"But … with the virtual outbreak in the hospital, all the physicians in the emergency group are aware and are having lower thresholds for testing now. People that we are admitting [who] may have just a cough or diarrhea or something that perhaps a month ago wasn't on the radar to test for, we're testing for again now.\"", "author": [{"name": "Brishti Basu", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/author/brishti-basu-1.6938718", "email": "brishti.basu@cbc.ca", "about": "Brishti Basu is a senior writer with CBCNews.ca based in Victoria.

Ross Macdonald School for the Blind in Brantford, Ont.\nBrown's family has said the teen, who was born with a genetic condition that left him blind, deaf and non-verbal, was in good health the weekend before he died at the school.\nLess than 12 hours passed between the time the family received a phone call indicating their son was slightly unwell and when Brown was declared dead, his mother testified at the inquest.\nJury recommends staff get medical training\nJurors heard that overnight staff at the school were shocked to find Brown unresponsive on the morning of his death after routinely checking on him through the night.\nThe inquest jury found that Brown died by natural causes, of acute bronchopneumonia.\nJurors recommended medical training be provided for staff at schools for disabled children on how to identify potential early symptoms of aspiration pneumonia, as well as mandatory training on ableism with a focus on the dangers it poses for those with disabilities.\nThey also recommended that the schools develop protocols for \"ongoing monitoring, documenting, and interdisciplinary consultation among staff regarding noticed changes\" in students' behaviour and medical symptoms.\nJurors further called for a system to verify that overnight bed checks are being completed.\nThe inquest heard that support staff working at W. Ross Macdonald on Feb. 8 and Feb. 9, 2018 had been checking on Brown at half-hour intervals all night and kept a close eye on him, given he appeared to have cold symptoms the evening before.\nStephanie Rymon-Lipinski, a former student support counsellor at the school, said it was only when she went into Brown's room at 6 a.m. to change his diaper that staff noticed the teen wasn't breathing.\nBefore finding him unresponsive, Rymon-Lipinski reported that Brown appeared \"congested\" and had a runny nose, but that was not out of the norm for the teen or cause for alarm.\nInquest hears that no medical staff were available overnight\nThe inquest also heard that there were no nurses or medical staff available overnight at the school once the student health centre — which diagnosed Brown with a slight fever that evening, gave him Tylenol and cleared him to go back to his residence bed — closed at 11 p.m.\nAnother staff member had testified that she took Brown's temperature around 1 a.m. and it was within the normal range.\nThe inquest previously heard that Brown — who had been attending the school since he was four years old — had difficulty swallowing and had hospital admissions as a child for aspiration, which is when food or liquid enters one's airways. As a result, most of his food had to be pureed and he had an additional risk of developing pneumonia, which he had been admitted to hospital for in the past.\nDianne Harris, a support staff team leader at the school, told the inquest support staff are not medical professionals who could have recognized apparent or non-apparent signs of pneumonia specifically, and they were not informed of Brown's history of infection.\nA nurse who evaluated Brown at the student health centre the evening before he died testified that she noted nothing abnormal about his lungs, breathing rate or behaviour. She said support staff did a good job monitoring him overnight and she didn't believe them being informed of his previous pneumonia diagnosis would have changed how they cared for him.\nThe school now has a strict policy that students be sent home if they are feeling unwell rather than staying overnight, the inquest heard.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-08T10:30:00.819000", "date_modified": "2023-09-08T11:24:00.563000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The group's ultimate goal is to hold a vote in Punjab in 2025.\nHowever, the vote is not legally binding in India.\nHere's what you need to know.\nHow will the vote work?\nNew York-based lawyer Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice, says the group intends to bring results to the United Nations to garner support for Sikh self-determination on the basis of religion and language.\n\"Once the voting is complete we are going to present our case to the United Nations seeking them to push India to get an official referendum just on the lines of the way Scottish people did it in the U.K.,\" Pannun said.\nBut Sikhs for Justice is banned in India and accused of supporting violent extremism, according to January 2020 charges filed in New Delhi \npublished online\n by the country's ministry of home affairs.\nThe group, which has actively drawn attention to human rights abuses in India since 2009, has encouraged demonstrations at Indian consulates globally over the past two years.\nProtesters chant outside the Consulate General of India's office in Vancouver on June 24 following the shooting of Shaheed Bhai Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, B.C.\n \n(Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press)\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada (WSO), which has advocated for Sikh rights since 1984, says it has no ties to the group.\n\"They're not a group that we've worked with in the past but having been said there is nothing to suggest from what we've seen that they are a terrorist organization as the Indian government alleges,\" said WSO spokesperson Balpreet Singh.\nInternet shutdowns, dozens of arrests and a manhunt. What's happening in India's Punjab state?\nThe vote comes as the Indian government is in the process of strengthening laws targeting separatist activities on its soil, including the use of signs promoting the cause, electronic communication used by protest groups, and financial support.\nUnder a new bill, Section 150 of the Indian Penal Code, minimum jail terms for such activities have doubled from three years to seven.\nWhy is it important?\nThe vote in Surrey, which is part of Metro Vancouver, is scheduled for Sept. 10 — a day before the G20 summit hosted in Delhi.\nSikhs for Justice says that date was deliberately selected to draw attention to the treatment of Sikhs.\nAlmost 25 per cent of the world's Sikhs live outside of India, including more than 750,000 in Canada.\nIndira Prahst, an instructor in the sociology and anthropology department at Langara College, says the vote will not likely result in the formation of a new country, but images of Sikhs lined up to vote, waving yellow and blue Khalistan flags are an important optic.\nThe group Sikhs for Justice has drafted its vision for an independent Sikh homeland, called Khalistan, in yellow on this map of northern India.\n \n(Sikhs for Justice)\n\"It's powerfully symbolic because what it's showing … it's rekindling the spirit of Khalistan that it has not been quashed,\" said Prahst.\nImages of slain Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale have become \npopular on posters\n, t-shirts and bumper stickers.\nThe separatist movement has re-emerged ahead of India's general election between April and May 2024, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi \nfaces criticism\n over high inflation, unemployment and a failed attempt to bring in new farm laws.\nWho can vote and who will oversee the process?\nOne of the key questions about the vote is who will oversee it and whether that oversight is independent and accountable.\nSikhs for Justice says anyone who is Sikh, is 18 years old or above can vote, regardless of where they were born.\nSpokesperson Gurpatwant Pannun says while Sikhs for Justice is facilitating the vote, a separate group — the Punjab Referendum Commission — will do the count.\nOn its website, the commission describes itself as a panel of independent democracy and political experts, with a mailing address in Arlington, Va. It says it is not responsible for selecting voting locations, determining registration requirements or voting dates.\nIndian government warns of rise in hate crimes, 'anti-India activities' in Canada\nTo vote, members of the Sikh community need to bring one piece of identification to get their voter ID and a ballot, Pannun said.\nAsked by CBC News whether he has any concerns about the security of voter information that is being collected, Pannun said he does not.\n\"There is no chance of anybody misusing this data or this data going to anybody.\"\nWhat happens after?\nThat the vote could lead to the formation of Khalistan is quickly dismissed by Shinder Purewal, political science professor at Kwantlen Polytechnic University.\nPurewal — who comments regularly on local and international political issues on Surrey radio stations, and has authored books exploring politics in Punjab, \nSikh Ethnonationalism and the Political Economy of Punjab \nand\n Tandoori Democracy\n — says to be legitimate under international law, a referendum should be held in the state of Punjab, not abroad involving people who have left the region.\n\"You don't hold [a] referendum outside in diaspora to establish a country.

She explores how he may have been targeted for his support of Khalistan, a Sikh homeland.\nBains says key flashpoints in recent history include Indian military troops storming the Golden Temple, Sikhism's most revered shrine, in June 1984. Sikh activist Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and some of his supporters, who were heavily armed and had taken refuge inside the temple, were killed.\nLater that year, in October, following the assassination of then-prime minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards, riots against the minority group in Delhi and elsewhere led to attacks against Sikhs.\nThe massacre of thousands of Sikhs from Oct. 31 to Nov. 5, 1984, was etched into the collective memory of Sikhs who have left India, and escalated calls for Khalistan around the world.\n\"The term 'Khalistan' is one of the ways that people can express this frustration,\" said Harjeet Grewal, assistant professor in religious studies at the University of Calgary.\nIn Canada, a group of Sikh separatists came under suspicion after the bombing of Air India Flight 182 on June 23, 1985, which killed 329 people travelling from Toronto to Mumbai through London.

Supreme Court in a bid to dismantle the camps.\nHowever, the judge in the case ruled the city \nhad failed to prove there were enough suitable alternatives for residents to move into\n, resulting in Moccasin Flats effectively being protected by court order.\nThe small Atco trailer at Moccasin Flats in Prince George, B.C., is staffed by volunteers and peer workers 24 hours a day, providing harm reduction supplies, snacks, and a place to warm up when it gets cold. Staff say it is a lifeline for those living at the court-protected encampment. Pictured here on April 16, 2023. \n \n(Kate Partridge/CBC)\nThat protection was reinforced in 2022 when a second judge ruled \nthe city had violated the previous court order\n by tearing down several structures the city claimed were abandoned but which residents testified they were still using as shelters.\nThe decision to shut down the camps also drew criticism from the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, with regional Chief Terry Teegee pointing out the \nmajority of homeless residents in Prince George are Indigenous\n, many with direct ties to residential schools and a foster care system that has been responsible for breaking up families, contributing to addiction and mental health struggles.\nSince then, Moccasin Flats has continued to stand, and several service organizations have established operations in the area, providing a supervised consumption site, dumpsters, a warming trailer and portable toilets.\nCity of Prince George apologizes for 'trauma' caused by destroying part of homeless camp\nCity of Prince George violated court order in destroying homeless people's belongings, judge rules\nMeanwhile, another camp was established several blocks away in Millennium Park, next to a regional district office and along the Highway 16 entrance into the city, prompting complaints of it being both an eyesore and a safety hazard, with nearby buildings increasing security as a result.\nIn response to both these developments, city council \nendorsed a centralized encampment model\n of redirecting campers to the court-protected Moccasin Flats sites.\nBut not everyone wants to move: residents of both sites say there are good reasons to keep two separate camps so people who do not get along or pose safety risks to each other aren't forced into the same location.\nAs Savory put it, \"It's gonna cause nothing but a bunch of fights\" to force everyone together.\nProvince admonishes city's plans\nMayor Simon Yu said he would prefer that people being evicted from Millennium Park go into housing while admitting there are currently not enough spaces available for them to do so. \nWhen asked what happens if people choose not to leave the park, Yu said, \"I hope we do not have to cross that.\"\nYu was first elected to public office in October 2022, and one of his central policy platforms was a \npromise to build emergency shelters\n to address the housing situation, similar to those he had helped construct in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia.\nDaybreak North\n7:26\nHousing minister responds to Millennium Park eviction

shut down the Millennium Park camp seems to have frayed those ties: provincial Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon responded with a public statement of disappointment, saying his office had \noffered Prince George resources, including a dedicated encampment response team and temporary housing units\n that were turned down and admonished the city for acting \"unilaterally\" to shut down the camp before

up until the point of last week's eviction announcement. \n\"We did offer [the city of Prince George] significant dollars so that we could get more shelter spaces open, but it was a matter of landing on locations that were viable,\" he said.\nAsked if city staff had indeed been a part of these conversations without council being aware, a city spokesperson said, \"The city continues to look into this issue and will issue a statement in due course.\"\nDaybreak North\n10:56\nMillennium Park encampment residents ordered to evacuate\nMayor Simon Yu talks about safety concerns and the early

more and more people lighting fires to keep warm with summer coming to an end.\n\"Nights are already getting significantly colder, and people are already using fire to keep themselves warm at night,\" she said, pointing out that Millennium Park is more densely packed than Moccasin Flats, thereby posing a higher fire risk.\nThe decision to shut down the camp also comes after an explosion at an unoccupied restaurant, which \ninvestigators have not linked to the homeless population\n but which has reignited general feelings of anger about the state of downtown from many business owners who say they are regularly dealing with theft, vandalism and harassment.\nAn Aug. 22 explosion in downtown Prince George reignited feelings of anger among business owners that the area is being neglected by city leaders.\n \n(Gian Paolo Mendoza/CBC)\nFollowing the explosion, city manager Walter Babicz \nsent an email to city staff\n, which was leaked to several media outlets, including CBC News, promising efforts were underway to shut down encampments while acknowledging the city's previous missteps in court.\n\"We have been focused on checking all the boxes required to ultimately bring an end to outdoor camping in Prince George,\" he said, indicating plans to shut down Millennium Park had been months in the making but had not been publicized due to legal concerns.\nFor his part, Yu acknowledged there was some \"misalignment\" between the city and the province but emphasized there is a shared goal of moving people off of the street and into safe housing, especially before winter hits.\nBut at Millennium Park, people like Marisa Marie James, who are most affected by the decision, say they are feeling abandoned as they are forced to move their belongings with no clear place to go.\n\"I don't feel like it's unsafe here,\" she said. \"It's a community ... there should be no reason why they're trying to kick us out.\"", "author": [{"name": "Andrew Kurjata", "url":

Police say the attack was random.\nCourt records show Ingram has also spent some time in provincial jail over the last few years, after pleading guilty to offences including arson, theft and mischief. \nZaman also noted his client deals with some substance abuse issues and mental health issues, which Ingram interrupted to say include an \"unspecified psychotic disorder.\"\nCourt heard that while police asked Ingram the night of the attack about whether his actions against the victim — who was wearing a hijab — were motivated by racism, he was adamant in denying that possibility.\nWhen given a chance to speak at the sentencing, Ingram apologized to the victim and reiterated the attack \"was not a hate crime.\"\nZaman said on Wednesday the attack was driven by \"an accumulation of factors\" including mental illness.\n\"This was unfortunately a tragic incident and we acknowledge the considerable harm that was done,\" he said.\nHateful graffiti in Winnipeg points to disturbing trends, say Jewish, Muslim community members\nThe assault shook Winnipeg's Muslim community, which rallied around the victim and called for the attack to be \ninvestigated as a targeted hate crime\n.

He called for more discussions around how people can access these supports.\n\"We can learn about doing things more efficiently, doing things in a targeted way that can increase public safety in Canada, and a lot of those involve social and public policy to address issues of marginalization,\" Grills said. \n\"A way to try to address interpersonal violence is to speak to these larger societal issues rather than stigmatize members within these kinds of communities.\"\nHealing the community\nAll agencies, people and partners need to work together to help prevent future tragedies, Gravel-Ouellette said, and a major piece of that is proactive community outreach.\nOne of the greatest lessons for service providers is that \"we are not responsible for the outcome, but we are responsible for the process,\" said Community Mobilization Westman's Irvine.\nTask force's 10 recommendations for Brandon's downtown spark optimism, momentum\nAnalysis\n'Winnipeg does not have a plan': Record homicides won't abate until well-being is properly funded, experts say\nIf the community wants to understand the human impact of these deaths, it has to see the human face and experience of everyone effected, Irvine said. She said steps can be taken to try to alleviate circumstances that lead to violence by focusing on emotional connections.\nThat means social supports that collaboratively intervene before there's a crisis or death. Irvine believes proactive steps to support mental health, addictions and other social issues can create a safer community.\n\"We need to figure it out now,\" Irvine said. \"Things are not going to go well unless we get in front of this.\"", "author": [{"name": "Chelsea Kemp", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/author/chelsea-kemp-1.6527866", "email": "chelsea.kemp@cbc.ca", "about": "Chelsea Kemp is a multimedia journalist with CBC Manitoba.

He also said that Ahmo's heart stopped during the confrontation with officers. \nRobert Jeffrey Morden, a correctional officer and captain of Headingley's Corrections Emergency Response Unit, is on trial on charges related to Ahmo's death, including criminal negligence causing death and failure to provide the necessities of life. \nAhmo, 45, was an inmate at Headingley before his death more than two years ago. He was taken to hospital in medical distress following a Feb. 7, 2021, standoff between corrections officers and Ahmo in a common room at the jail.\nHeadingley inmate said he felt he was in a war hours before he became unconscious, court heard Tuesday\nAhmo died a week later. Manitoba's chief medical examiner ruled his death a homicide.\nDuring the start of Morden's trial last week, court saw more than three hours of video shot on a handheld camera by an officer in a secured staff area behind protective glass.\nIn the video, Ahmo, 45, appeared to become agitated. The video showed Ahmo ripping a water tank and televisions from the wall, smashing them on the floor and throwing them at the protective glass of the secured staff area.\nCourt sees video of inmate's final hours in Manitoba jail on 1st day of corrections officer's trial\nLittman said he watched the footage from that day. He testified Ahmo looked to be under a lot of physiological stress and exhaustion during the incident, likely causing his heart rate to rise. \nHe testified that Ahmo did have an enlarged heart, a condition that could have exacerbated his body's reaction to the stress, but Littman said that wasn't the cause of his death. \nProne restraint used on Ahmo\nThe video played in court last week showed that after hours of observation, members of Headingley's emergency response unit entered the area of the jail where Ahmo was.\nThe officers shot chemical projectiles at Ahmo, who was standing on the second floor of the unit, holding a broom handle. After a few minutes, Ahmo moved and swung the broom handle at about a dozen officers, who swarmed him and took him down. \nSoon after, Ahmo was brought into another room. \nIn the video, officers could be seen holding down Ahmo in a prone restraint, which is where someone is held face down on the floor, with their legs and arms restrained, often with a knee placed on their back.\nMother files lawsuit alleging racist treatment led to beating death of Anishinaabe son at Headingley jail\nLittman testified that this type of restraint can asphyxiate a person, since it restricts a person's chest, preventing them from breathing properly. \nLittman said that in the video, when Ahmo was being held face down, he \"appears to snore,\" which is a sign of agonal breathing — often described as gasping for air. \n\"It's breathing that occurs at the end of life,\" Littman testified. \"It's several breaths, a reflex reaction, to the brain being starved of oxygen.\" \n\"Death is a process, and agonal breathing is part of that process.\" \nShortly after, in the video, Ahmo said, \"I can't breathe,\" while being restrained face down. \nMorden could be heard telling Ahmo, \"William, if you're talking, you can breathe.\"  \nManitoba grand chief calls for public inquiry into in-custody death of William Ahmo\nDuring cross-examination, defense lawyer Richard Wolson asked Littman to clarify how Ahmo could talk if he was having trouble breathing. \n\"If you're out of breath, you might complain that you're having trouble breathing?\" asked Wolson. \nLittman replied, \"If I run up the stairs, and I'm out of breath, I'm not having trouble breathing.\" \nHe continued, \"Having trouble breathing is having an obstruction to breathing, or you're having an asthmatic attack.\" \nIn the video, Ahmo was transferred to a restraint chair, where he lost consciousness. Shortly after, paramedics were called in. \nEarlier this week, paramedic John Kirouac testified that when he arrived at Headingley, he found Ahmo unresponsive, with no pulse. After minutes of performing CPR on Ahmo, paramedics were able to revive him. \nAhmo was taken to Grace Hospital in Winnipeg and was intubated. A week later, he was taken off life support. He died Feb. 14, 2021. \nLittman's autopsy found small fractures in Ahmo's chest bone, caused by the CPR paramedics performed on him, but Littman concluded those injuries did not result in Ahmo's death. \nOther small external injuries were found on Ahmo's body, including scrapes and bruises, but Littman determined they did not contribute to his death.\nThe judge-only trial, being presided over by Manitoba provincial court Judge Tony Cellitti, began Sept. 1 and continues Friday. ", "author": [{"name": "Stephanie Cram ", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/author/stephanie-cram-1.3446870", "email": "", "about": "Stephanie Cram is a reporter based in Winnipeg.

Serbia, led by Atlanta Hawks star  Bogdan Bogdanovic dominated Canada on both ends of the court. Canada will face the USA in the 3rd place game on Sunday.\nOgnjen Dobric and Nikola Milutinov each scored 16 for Serbia, the best-shooting team so far in the tournament — making 55 per cent of its shots coming into the day, then connecting on 62 per cent to end Canada's hopes of gold.\n\"It doesn't matter who's not here,\" Serbia's Marko Guduric said. \"It's all about this group of guys, whoever is here, whoever is wearing this Serbian jersey. We never give up. We fight until the end. It's in our blood.\"\nSerbia (6-1) is in the World Cup final for the second time in the last three tournaments. It lost to the U.S. in the 2014 final, and will face either Germany on Sunday night in the title game at Manila.\n\"Nobody believed but we didn't care about anybody,\" Serbia forward Filip Petrusev said. \"We just had fun with each other. It's a great group of guys, great chemistry, and when you have good chemistry and great players, anything can happen. We believed and we're here.\"\n'Proud of my guys'\nDillon Brooks scored 16 for Canada and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 15 — 10 below his tournament average entering the day.\n\"I'm proud of my guys,\" Canada coach Jordi Fernandez said. \"It was not perfect.

Gold or silver, that's the only question.\n\"I want to dedicate this win to him,\" Guduric said of Simanic, who remains in a Manila hospital. \"Hopefully, we're going to see him soon with us, with the team. Just want to say that hopefully he feels a little bit better when he knows he has a medal. I know it's not important, but I hope we made him happy tonight.\"\nSlew of early foul trouble\nCanada started the tournament with an emphatic 95-65 win over reigning Olympic silver medallist France, and had the second-lowest odds — behind the U.S. — of winning gold. But it got into a slew of foul trouble early Friday, which kept the defence from getting on track, which in turn kept the offence from getting easy baskets.\nAnd Serbia feasted off all of that. Serbia's lead was 52-39 at the break, and by then Canada — which lost the lead for good after Gilgeous-Alexander picked up his second foul with 3:27 left in the first, and had all five of its starters with two fouls by halftime — was fuming over the foul situation. The fuming eventually tapered off, but Canada never got the lead back.\nTHE BUZZER\nGilgeous-Alexander outplays Doncic to send Canada to World Cup semis\nCanada ended up called for 25 fouls to Serbia's 22, and actually shot more free throws than the winners — 27-20.\n\"I think we lost because we didn't defend. I'll leave the officiating for whoever judges the officials,\" Fernandez said. \"I can only say to them thanks for doing their jobs. Without officials we couldn't play the game of basketball.\"\nSerbia led by 15 late in the half. That was the biggest deficit Canada had faced yet in this tournament; it faced 12-point deficits against Latvia and Spain, rallying to win both times.\nNot this time, though. Serbia wouldn't give the lead up, and Canada's only medal hope now is bronze.\n\"I know these guys will do whatever it takes to go get that medal,\" Fernandez said.\nGermany outlasts U.S.\nIn the other semi, Andreas Obst scored 24 points, Franz Wagner added 22 and Germany shredded the U.S. defence for much of the way in its first win over the Americans.\nObst hit the shot of the night, a 3-pointer with 1:15 left to put Germany up by four and just about snuff out a last-ditch U.S. rally. Germany led for 30 of the game's 40 minutes, the U.S. led for about 4-½, and there was little question who was controlling play much of the way.\n\"We knew the task at hand, and that was to go win,\" U.S. guard Austin Reaves said. \"And we didn't do that.\"\nThe U.S., down by 10 midway through the fourth, nearly pulled off a comeback, getting within one point on two separate occasions in the final minutes. But the Americans never got the lead, and it was the Germans jumping and hugging as time expired.\nGermany had been 0-6 against the Americans in World Cup or Olympic competition, usually getting blown out in those games.\nNot this time. Once again, even bringing the only roster filled with all NBA players wasn't enough for the U.S. at the World Cup. The Americans finished seventh at the 2019 World Cup in China; this finish — third or fourth — will technically be better, but nothing other than gold was going to be satisfactory for USA Basketball.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-08T06:48:35.907000", "date_modified": "2023-09-08T12:55:02.460000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

If service were increased to three per cent below pre-pandemic levels, that shortage would increase to about 80 drivers.\n\"So to expand service when we already have a shortage would be, obviously, not a great idea,\" Radstrom said.\nTransit has streamlined parts of its hiring process, taking in applications, doing interviews and testing in a single day.\nThe expanded service would require transit to hire 16.75 full-time equivalent staff, including bus operators, maintenance workers and supervisors. \n\"Even now, we're not saying for sure that fall of 2024 we could actually implement [the new routes],\" Radstrom said.\n\"We have to reassess and if our recruitment is going well and we've been able to hire enough drivers and retain enough existing drivers, then we could.\"", "author": [{"name": "Cameron MacLean", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/author/cameron-maclean-1.4293373", "email": "cameron.maclean@cbc.ca", "about": "Cameron MacLean is a journalist for CBC Manitoba living in Winnipeg, where he was born and raised.

That's the first shrinkage since the onset of the pandemic and a sign the economy may be tipping into at least a mild recession.\nNo reason for further hikes, strategist says\nJim Thorne, a strategist at Toronto based investment firm Wellington-Altus, says not only is there no good reason to hike any more, but it's actually hard to retroactively justify some of the hikes that have already happened.\n\"I'm in the camp that says they should have stopped at 2.5 per cent and then let things settle out,\" he told CBC News in an interview.\n\"The Bank of Canada's mistake is that they're trying to find use monetary policy as a fine tuning instrument [but] it's a blunt instrument — and they're going to go too far.\"\nInstead of a mild recession or so-called \"soft landing\" that economists hope for, he's forecasting a hard landing for Canada's economy next year as the system deals with too much expensive debt and \nconsumers tapping out\n.\n\"The numbers just don't add up, so I don't know why Tiff Macklem is raising rates,\" he said, referring to the head of the central bank. \"No other central banker has ever raised rates when real gross domestic income is as negative as it is right now.\"\n\"People up here are whistling by the graveyard, thinking that this is not going to be very, very painful.\"\nWATCH | Economist questions rate hike rationale: \nEconomist questions rate hike rationale\n3 months ago\nDuration \n2:35\nArmine Yalnizyan, the Atkinson Fellow on the Future of Workers, says the central bank's decision to raise interest rates again won't help fix the inflation problem, and could actually make things worse.\nWhile people like Thorne are concerned the bank has overshot on rate hikes, the bank itself makes it clear that it stands ready to raise them by even more should the situation require it.\nIn a statement accompanying its decision, the bank said it \"remains concerned about the persistence of underlying inflationary pressures, and is prepared to increase the policy interest rate further if needed.\"\nRoyce Mendes, an economist with Desjardins, says it is noteworthy that policymakers at the central bank \"aren't completely shutting the door to further rate increases.\"\n\"It's no surprise that policymakers are hesitant to declare an end to the era of rate hikes, [because] a premature signal that rates have reached their peak would cause an unwanted easing in financial conditions,\" Mendes said.\nMost economic indicators are tracking weaker than the bank was forecasting in its most recent outlook, Mendes added, so ultimately he thinks the bank is quite likely to be done with hikes — whether they're willing to admit that or not. \n\"The recent string of weak data reinforces our call that the Bank of Canada will not be raising rates any further this cycle,\" Mendes said.\nBrampton homeowner Shahan Ahmed says the bank's campaign of rate hikes have pushed his family to the financial edge. \n \n(Craig Chivers/CBC)\nHome owner surprised by large hikes\nIf they are in fact done, it's not a moment too soon for homeowners like Shahan Ahmed — and it may in fact be too late.\nAhmed owned and occupied a home in Brampton when he decided, in 2021, to buy a second one to use as an investment property. He said he knew the rate on his variable rate mortgage would go up, but not as quickly as it did.\n\"We thought it's going to go up by 25 basis points every time,\" he told CBC News in an interview, meaning that even with a half a dozen hikes from the Bank of Canada, or more, his rate might have gone up by maybe two percentage points.\nAnalysis\nHas the Bank of Canada conquered inflation? It's complicated\nAnalysis\nIs the Bank of Canada making things worse?\nInstead, the bank hiked 10 times since early 2022, often in increments of \n0.5\n, \n0.75\n and \neven a full percentage point\n at a time. That caused Ahmed's variable rate mortgage payment to almost double from $3,300 a month to $5,500.\nHe's now living in the investment property and renting out his original home, but his rental income doesn't cover his costs so he's taken a second job and now works 15-hour days.\nHe says he's reluctant to sell one or both properties because that would simply lock in a paper loss of up to $300,000.\n\"Hopefully there is no rate hike because it is our breaking point,\" he said. \"We cannot take it anymore.\"\nBank of Canada wary of hiking too much, too fast, deliberations show", "author": [{"name": "Pete Evans", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/author/pete-evans-1.3333505", "email": "pete.evans@cbc.ca", "about": "Pete Evans is the senior business writer for CBCNews.ca.

That left facilities without proper oversight in a time where hundreds died in a matter of weeks.\n\"To effectively oversee a system, you have to have inspections,\" Dubé said at a Thursday morning news conference. \"It was already strained before the pandemic, and it was not ready.\n\"The system wasn't there to enable inspections to happen in a safe and effective manner.\"\nThe ministry's lack of planning and preparedness was \"unreasonable, unjust and wrong,\" the ombudsman found.

Though he launched the investigation of his own accord after the CAF report landed, his office also received 269 complaints and inquiries from families of long-term care residents, as well as from employees and other stakeholders in the sector.\nAccording to the report, one ministry employee reported a \"complete system breakdown\" in the early weeks of the pandemic, with inspections stopping because the province had no plan to ensure the safety of inspectors. At the time, inspectors had no personal protective equipment or training on infection control.\nLeniency for critical issues\nInstead, inspectors were deployed to call and \"support\" homes, Dubé wrote. When inspections began again, only workers who volunteered were sent into facilities experiencing outbreaks, and inspectors often gave homes reduced penalties for non-compliance, or let them have months to remedy issues that were causing residents' serious harm. \n\"We saw many examples where inspectors used their considerable discretion to lower the default enforcement action that would otherwise apply, even in very serious situations and with little to no explanation,\" Dubé said in the report — effectively making sure homes were \"let off quite easily\" and given time to fix things instead of facing tough sanctions for serious issues, he later told reporters.\nNiagara Centre MPP Wayne Gates told reporters Thursday that the ombudsman's report illustrated an 'absolute failure' on the part of the provincial government.\n \n(OntarioLegislature YouTube)\nOne such example laid out in the report was at Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon, which was the first facility in the province to experience a large outbreak of the virus. By the time it was declared over, 28 of the home's 65 residents had died.\nAn inspection found a litany of problems, like staff and residents sitting together and not wearing masks, staff not changing their gloves while moving throughout the home, not putting on or removing protective equipment properly, and a recently hospitalized resident returning to the home and being put in a room with another resident, even though there were other rooms available.\nIn this situation, policy recommended the ministry revoke the home's licence and consider installing an interim manager while it shut down, the report says.\nInstead, inspectors gave the home three months to train staff and make sure issues were fixed.\nRecommendations made\nThe ombudsman has made a host of recommendations to the province, including:\n   \nRegular training for inspectors.\n   \nProviding enough personal protective equipment.\n   \nEstablishing clear rules for when on-site inspections are needed.\n   \nEnsuring the ministry always has staff with expertise in infection control measures available for in-person inspections.\n   \nIssuing immediate compliance orders in situations where residents are at an ongoing risk of serious harm.\n   \nMaking sure the inspections branch has enough staff.\n  \nDubé says he is pleased with the ministry's response to his recommendations, with over half of them being fully or partially implemented already.\nRead the ombudsman's full report:\nMobile users: View the document\n (PDF \nKB)\n (Text \nKB)\nCBC is not responsible for 3rd party content", "author": [{"name": "Adam Carter", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/author/adam-carter-1.3573742", "email": "adam.carter@cbc.ca", "about": "Adam Carter is a Newfoundlander who now calls Toronto home.

She said that when she first moved into her apartment, she heard the street's road work would be complete by February 2023.\nSix months later, River Street is still closed and under construction.\nFor Fatima, a typical day begins with the sound of rocks being unloaded from trucks at 7 a.m. or earlier, followed by a beeping sound from construction machines.\n\"I don't need an alarm. I can wake up anytime when they start this thing,\" she said.\nThese nuisances aren't unique to just Fatima. River Street residents have experienced issues as a result of the road's construction, such as sewage backup and their homes shaking from the road work.\nRiver Street has been closed since May 2022 as a result of a sinkhole that developed above the culvert overtop of McVicar Creek near Farrand Street. Construction crews have been working on repairing the road, but have kept pushing back the reopen date. In total, River Street has been closed for nearly 16 months.\nNow, some River Street residents like Fatima say they're frustrated with the continued road work and the inconveniences that go with it.\n\"What really is concerning is that the timeline that they gave … is not fulfilled and the deadlines are extended,\" said Fatima. \"And then you question how long it will take for this construction to get completed.\"\nCrew 'maybe underestimated' time needed to complete project\nMike Vogrig, lead engineer of the River Street construction, said all city construction is \"definitely\" an inconvenience, but it's something that must be taken care of. He said he appreciates River Street residents' patience while the construction crew works to finish the bridge.\nWhile the construction has prolonged and River Street's opening day has been pushed back multiple times, Vogrig said this is one of the largest river crossings he's ever done since he's worked with the city.\n\"I think maybe what some people might think [is], 'Oh, you're just replacing a culvert.' Well, this is a structural multi-play culvert. And it's quite a massive, massive undertaking,\" he said.\nVogrig said that when the sinkhole first appeared, and he and his team got approvals from the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, to block off a portion of the road's culvert, they did an inspection and discovered the culvert had shifted and rotated, and found large portions of the bottom of the culvert had failed.\n\"So then we kind of went into a situation of, 'We have to make some repairs here, we're going have to fix this,'\" he said.\nVogrig added that in August 2022, he and the construction team realized the structural lining of the River Street bridge wouldn't work and had to do a full culvert replacement.\nThe new culvert installed in River Street is preferred by environmentalists because the open bottom provides better fish passages and a natural stream flow for animals and fish, says lead engineer Mike Vogrig.\n \n(Taylor O'Brien/CBC)\n\"The old structure was just normal round culverts, so they have a bottom on them and the water would just go through those. So this is different in the sense, [this new culvert is] just a one-piece unit and it has an open bottom.\"\nIn addition, Vogrig said they will typically plan and design a project a year in advance. But they \"didn't have that luxury\" with this one.\n\"The big culvert that's in place now isn't something that's just readily available, it has to be built and constructed to suit your particular project. So those are the kinds of things that typically you would have planning time and resources to do.\"\nVogrig said the construction crew has tried to finish as quickly as they could. However, he said, the construction is a large-scale project, and while overall he doesn't feel the project \"went super far behind schedule, maybe we underestimated the actual time that it needed to get done.\"\nRiver Street not a priority, says Fatima\nFatima, an international student from Pakistan, said she's reflected on the different places she's lived before moving to River Street, and has seen other bridges get fixed much sooner in comparison to the one on River. She said a one-kilometre river bridge in Pakistan was under construction for only six months.\n\"It's a small bridge. It's not a big deal,\" she said. \"And what I have known through my experiences of [bridge construction] is even in countries where I come from, developing countries, they are done pretty quicker than it's taking here to finish a small bridge.\"\nFatima said she doesn't believe River Street is considered a priority, because if it were, it would've been finished by now.\nConstruction on River Street has led to residents saying they've experienced issues such as sewage backup and their homes shaking.\n \n(Taylor O'Brien/CBC)\n\"The work is finished quite early [in the day],\" she said. \"There is a lot of time [in] the day which can be utilized for that. And I see the workers working on rainy days and heavy wind days. But I [think] if they utilize their whole day properly, they might finish it [sooner].\"\nShe said she often asks workers when the construction will be complete, and they usually say it will take a month.\n\"I just don't understand, like every time when we ask, it's like, 'Oh, now it's all finished,' but it's not all finished. And it takes ages to finish.\"\nRoad closure allows neighbours to meet each other\nBonnie Satten and Charles Faust have lived on River Street for 10 years. While the two recognize how the road's closure and construction work has created hardships for some residents, they said they haven't really been impacted.\n\"It hasn't really inconvenienced us,\" said Satten. \"In fact, it's been really lovely and quiet.\"\nBefore the road closed, Satten said River Street was always loud because of the busy traffic going up and down the road. Now, it's quiet, which has allowed her and Faust to get to know their neighbours across the street.\n\"It's true that it was almost impossible to have a conversation with your neighbour across the street because of noise. You'd have to try and wait for a chance to dodge between the traffic and go and talk to them.\"\nBonnie Satten and Charles Faust, left to right, have lived on River Street for 10 years. They say they recognize the hardships the road construction has had on other residents, but it hasn't impacted them much.\n \n(Taylor O'Brien/CBC)\nWhile the two said they haven't been seriously affected by the road closure, Faust said it's important to understand that when construction like this comes along, there will be advantages and disadvantages that affect people's convenience.\n\"I wouldn't want to make light of the hardships that some people have had, because some people have really had more trouble with it than we've had,\" he said.\nSatten said the construction is inconvenient because they can't drive down River Street due to the closure, but \"on the whole, we have not suffered from this construction.\"\n\"I don't think I'll be disappointed [when the construction ends], but I'll miss the quiet.\"\nImpacts on traffic, city services\nAs a Lakehead University student, Fatima said she relies on city transportation to get to school. But with the road closed, she must walk approximately 12 minutes to catch the bus.\n\"I was expecting that the bus [would] pass [through] here. But that didn't happen, and the construction was not completed back then and it still continues to go on.\"\nFatima added her home didn't get its garbage and recycling picked up a few weeks ago because of the road construction.\nSatten said she and Faust still get city services, such as garbage and recycling collection, and they can also park their vehicles on River Street.\nFatima said she's concerned about the noise level from the construction. She's even had to leave her home to attend her online classes elsewhere because it can get so loud, she said.\nOn the other hand, Satten said, she and Faust don't really get annoyed by the noise.\n\"River Street isn't a quiet street at the best of times when there's full traffic, so we might get the little 'ding ding dings' and the crushing of rock in the daytime, but there's no nighttime noise.\"\nRoad projected to reopen in September\nAccording to lead engineer Vogrig, River Street is hoped to reopen the second or third week of September. He said the bridge has progressed quite well.\nThere are still things left to be done such as installing a portion of the water main, disassembling and removing the utility bridge built to support the gas line and telecommunications lines, and putting down concrete, he said.\nSatten believes the construction workers are doing the best they can to get the bridge finished.\n\"They're doing a really thorough job, and the people have been very communicative … when you think about it, like the gas line, for example, you don't want them to just say, 'Oh well, unhook this and unhook that.' You want them to really be careful about what they're doing.\"\nSome free parking at Marina Park might come to an end as Thunder Bay mulls paid lot\nCurbless streets and patios: Thunder Bay plans May start for major north core overhaul\nFaust said the construction is a large project and he understands the time it takes to design a culvert.\n\"There are a lot of complexities to it, which I understand from having worked in that field, and so I think they've done the best they can. It's a big job.\"\nRegardless, Faust recognizes the difficulties residents have faced because of the road closure.\n\"It's time to get it open again.

In most countries, the illness is one of the top two leading causes of cancer deaths in women. \nBut\n research shows\n that early detection and treatment can save lives. \nTo increase screening capacity and better identify high and low risk breast cancer, two recent studies show that specific applications of artificial intelligence (AI) performed similarly to highly trained radiologists.  \n\"I think that breast imaging, especially mammography, [is] one of the front runners when it comes to the maturity of these AI tools,\" said Kristina Lång, lead author on one of the studies.\nLång's research, \nwhich was published in the Lancet Oncology journal\n last month, is the first of its kind to use AI to detect breast cancer from mammograms in a randomized control trial. \nPreliminary results of the Swedish trial show that AI detected more cancer, while keeping false positives to a minimum. \n\"The results were actually [above] our expectations,\" said Lång, a breast radiologist and associate professor at Lund University in Sweden. \nKristina Lång is the lead author on a randomized control trial out of Sweden that compares the results from at an AI-supported screening group and one with two radiologists. \n \n(Jennifer La Grassa/CBC)\nAnother smaller study, \npublished earlier this week\n in the journal Radiology, found that radiologists and AI came to similar conclusions after reviewing the same mammograms. \nThese recent studies are practical examples of the way AI could be used in healthcare to relieve a strained workforce, while ensuring more accurate diagnoses, say experts like Lång. \nBut other experts warn that the technology is still being refined to ensure it doesn't over diagnose or miss the cancer. \nAI reduced radiologist workload\nRadiologists are placing extra significance on Lång's research as it randomly assigned mammograms from more than 80,000 women to two groups. \nOne group involved AI-supported screening and the other followed double reading — a standard practice in Europe where two radiologists independently review each mammogram. \nIn the AI-supported group, the software triaged the scans by determining which ones were of low risk and needed only one radiologist to look at them, or high risk, requiring two radiologists. \nResults found that the AI-supported screening group detected about 20 per cent more cancers. It also had a similar number of false positives and women recalled for further analysis as the standard group. \nHow AI-equipped technology could help clinicians better diagnose mental health issues\nFrom virtual care apps to AI algorithms: the trouble with data collection in healthcare\nDue to the triaging, the radiologists in the AI-supported screening group read about 44 per cent fewer mammograms than those in the standard group. \n\"It's a difficult task to read large volumes of screening examinations in order to detect these small subtle cancers,\" said Lång. \"You have to be alert.\"\nAdditionally, she said radiology is \nexperiencing a significant worker shortage\n, so these results show the value of AI in areas with limited staff. \nAI can over diagnose, have trouble with dense breasts \n\"We should be embracing this technology as a really helpful tool to do better and try and diagnose more cancers at an early stage,\" said Jean Seely, who heads the breast imaging section at the Ottawa Hospital. \nBut she said there are still some issues that need to be refined. \nDr. Jean Seely is a professor of radiology at the University of Ottawa and also head of the breast imaging section at the Ottawa Hospital. \n \n(CBC News)\nIn particular, Lång's study found that AI can over diagnose cancers that might not end up being harmful to the patient. \n\"We want to call only those patients that really have cancer, but there's a fine line that we have to balance,\" said Seely, who is also a radiology professor at the University of Ottawa.\nShe also said that, at this point, AI doesn't compare the current mammogram it's reading to past ones, nor does it know that the patient might have already had a biopsy for a certain abnormality. \n\"So to rely on the AI only is really impossible,\" said Seely, adding that radiologists are also legally responsible for the mammogram interpretation. \n\"You have to have a trained person, radiologist, to be able to read those cases and say, 'yeah this is an appropriate recall, but this is not.'\"\nDr. Mojola Omole, a breast oncologist and surgeon in Ontario's Scarborough Health Network, also thinks AI shows promise for the future, but she's concerned with the technology's ability to detect \nbreast cancer in women with more dense tissue\n. \nDr. Mojola Omole is a breast surgical oncologist and a general surgeon with the Scarborough Health Network. She's also a member of the Black Physicians' Association of Ontario.\n \n(Submitted by Mojola Omole)\nTypically, she said, Black and Asian women can have more dense breast tissue, which hides the cancer. \n\"What I worry about sometimes, when we talk about AI medicine, is that populations such as racialized people, when it comes to breast cancer, are not necessarily going to be represented in that sample,\" she said. \nOmole noted that in the Swedish trial, the race and ethnicity of the women wasn't recorded. \nIf women of all backgrounds aren't included in research like this, said Omole, then it might mean that AI could misdiagnose them or miss the cancer completely. \nDr. Martin Yaffe, a professor and senior scientist at Sunnybrook Research Institute in Toronto, said his team is working on AI that can detect breast density and calculate the chances of a hidden cancer. \n\"We're stepping carefully to try and avoid doing anything foolish to get this new technology so that it's ready for prime time and that involves a lot of testing, and testing under a wide variety of circumstances,\" he said. \nMore research needed to determine tool's success\nUnlike in Europe, mammograms aren't screened by two radiologists in Canada. \nAs a result, Ottawa-based radiologist Seely said more research is needed to know how AI would work in the Canadian context. \nShe notes that it shouldn't \"replace a human,\" but that it \"adds more value.\"\nMartin Yaffe is senior scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto.\n \n(Keith Whelan/CBC)\nAnd that's what breast cancer survivor Marilyn Jordan also thinks about it. \n\"I feel positive about AI facilitating quicker diagnosis and catching more cancers than at the current time,\" said the 68-year-old Vancouver resident. \nJordan completed her breast cancer treatment last September after she pushed to get a mammogram a year before her regularly scheduled screening appointment. \nEven though AI can over diagnose, Jordan said she'd rather the tool be \"extra cautious\" and catch everything. \n\"Maybe it'll find a cyst that needs to be monitored annually, \" she said. \nThe Swedish trial is still ongoing and looks to better evaluate AI-supported screening by finding out whether it reduces the rate of interval cancer. \nInterval cancer is when a person is diagnosed with cancer after a normal result and before their next screening appointment. \nThe interval cancer rate will be determined after the participants have a follow-up two years from their screening in December 2024. \nLång said they're also interested to know whether the use of AI is cost effective. \n\"I think the synergistic effect, when humans work together with this AI tool, to use them in a safe and smart way, we can really ... improve both the efficiency and the quality of healthcare.\"", "author": [{"name": "Jennifer La Grassa", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/author/jennifer-la-grassa-1.5479691", "email": "jennifer.lagrassa@cbc.ca", "about": "Jennifer La Grassa is a videojournalist at CBC Windsor.

Andrew Leslie told CBC News the lack of a national rapid response force to help with wildfires, floods, evacuations and other emergencies is putting citizens' lives at risk.\nIn an exclusive interview with CBC News on Thursday, he said a dedicated national force is needed urgently, and could be \"built into\" or \"adjunct to\" the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) — but only if it comes with increased funding and doesn't further strain the country's already-stretched troops.\n\"The impact of climate change is irrefutable — it poses dangers to us all,\" Leslie said. \"What has current government done to prepare for what they knew was coming?\n\"The answer is nothing.

Andrew Leslie says Ottawa is far behind allies in creating a national emergency agency to help provinces. He warns Canadians' safety is at stake, but cautions against relying on an already-strained Canadian Armed Forces.\nA federal emergencies ministry spokesperson told CBC News there are multiple ways Ottawa is preparing for future natural disasters, including $700 million spent on wildfire management, where the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre — which co-ordinates mutual aid between provinces and territories — is key.\nOttawa says it is also pumping millions into training, equipment and planning, plus plans to update its Federal Emergency Response Plan. Defence Minister Bill Blair said he'll continue deploying the CAF when needed, calling Ottawa's commitment to national security and increased military funding \"ironclad.\"\n\"While the primary responsibility for response to natural disasters rests with provinces and territories, Canadians can expect to see the military continue to respond to emergencies when the capacity of provinces and territories is overwhelmed,\" Blair said in a statement.\nWhy doesn't Canada have a national wildfire-fighting force?\nThis summer has seen the CAF deployed to multiple natural disasters at the request of provinces, which are ultimately responsible for emergency management and natural disasters. These include Quebec, Alberta and now — until at least Sept. 15 — in B.C.\nMeanwhile, the Royal Canadian Air Force helped the unprecedented evacuation of Northwest Territories residents. Previously, soldiers were essential in the wake of catastrophic floods in B.C.'s Lower Mainland after an atmospheric river in 2021.\nScientists agree such natural disasters are becoming more devastating and more frequent as a direct result of a warming climate. \nAnalysis\nThe military can't be the first line of defence in domestic disasters, MPs told\n\"In Europe, it's hard to find a significant country ... which doesn't have a standalone emergency response force,\" Leslie said. \"Do you have it as standalone, per se, or do you nest it within the armed forces so they can leverage heavy equipment to transport their stuff?\n\"We already have military infrastructure bases spread across our country; we already have [CAF] transportation hubs which are well established.\"\n'Broadening it beyond fire is appropriate'\nMike Flannigan, the B.C. innovation research chair in predictive services, emergency management and fire science, has called repeatedly for a dedicated national wildfire response force. \nHe sees several options for what authority might oversee such an agency, but the armed forces have an obvious appeal — especially if they can gain specialized training, and respond to multiple types of climate disasters quickly.\nMilitary begins deployment, highway to Bella Coola closed as hundreds of wildfires burn across B.C.\nAnother option is to emulate the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), but with a greater emphasis on prevention and mitigation before disaster strikes.\n\"Using the military as a special branch with appropriate training, and being able to address the emergencies before, during and after … should be explored,\" the wildfire science professor at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, B.C., told CBC News.\n\"And broadening it beyond fire is appropriate, like a FEMA organization.\"\nMilitary already 'under-equipped and under-resourced'\nBut continuing to send in the CAF for the growing number of disasters would have some major drawbacks, several military experts warned.\nAlready, experts say, the country's military is severely underfunded, and struggling to maintain operational readiness — let alone coming close to Canada's NATO obligation to invest two per cent of its Gross Domestic Product into its armed forces. According to NATO, Canada currently \nfalls $20 billion short\n a year of that pledge.\n\"In a democracy, I think we need to be careful with the use of armed forces,\" said Christian Leuprecht, professor at Royal Military College and at Queen's University. \"This is an organization set apart for special purpose … whose ultimate purpose is the application of the use of force.\n\"It's probably not your optimal first-responder organization.\"\nMilitary personnel shortage will get worse before it gets better, top soldier says\nHe said Canada's overseas commitments — including thousands of troops in Russian neighbour Latvia, and training and supplying Ukraine — combined with multiple domestic deployments this year alone have pushed the CAF to the \"breaking point.\"\n\"It is seriously imperilling the organization from operating,\" Leuprecht said. \"The armed forces have become the easy button for government … every time somebody cries for help.\n\"People always have the impression if there's no war to fight, the military just kind of sits around, but quite the opposite is true. This is an organization that is massively overstretched because it's under-equipped, and under-resourced, for what it is being asked to do by politicians.\"\nWATCH | 'We need to invest significantly in the Canadian Armed Forces': defence minister:\n \nDefence minister says government is committed to investing in CAF to support wildfire efforts\n21 days ago\nDuration \n1:12\nDefence Minister Bill Blair says the government will invest to ensure the Canadian Armed Forces can continue to keep Canadians safe at home and abroad.\n'Proud of the work the armed forces does'\nThat concern is shared by the former lieutenant-general. As tensions with Russia and China escalate, Leslie said, domestic disaster relief must not be allowed to further stretch an underfunded military.\n\"They're called upon by the government because they have nowhere else to go to provide essentially brute force,\" Leslie said. \nBut, he asked, is soldiers filling sandbags during floods, felling trees to create wildfire breaks, and going door-to-door during ice storms going to actually mitigate the worst to come with climate change?\nGovernment prepared to order military airlift out of Yellowknife, defence minister says\n\"Those tasks could actually be done by almost anybody,\" he said, adding what is needed is a full-time, highly trained specialized force — one with as much a focus on prevention as it is on disaster relief.\n\"I'm very proud of the work the armed forces does … they respond at the drop of a hat,\" he said. \"We desperately need a focus on emergency and disaster preparedness. \n\"Stop talking about climate change and actually start doing something to help Canadians faced literally with threats to their lives, certainly their homes, and most certainly their livelihood.\"", "author": [{"name": "David P.

Calandra said he has asked the adjudicator to complete her work by the end of the year, at which point the agreements will be made public and subjected to the wider review process. He said he expects \"shovels in the ground\" on those sites by 2025.\n\"We want to ensure the highest level of accountability on those sites and future sites,\" Calandra said. He acknowledged that public trust in the government was damaged by the findings of Ontario's auditor general and integrity commissioner, who both issued scathing reports on the Greenbelt land swap.\nMinister promises 'full, open and accountable' process\nCalandra, like Ford and former housing minister Steve Clark before him, conceded the process was flawed. But Calandra said he stands behind the intent of what the government was trying to do.\n\"To be completely clear, I was very supportive of removing lands for the purposes of meeting our goal of building 1.5 million homes,\" he said.\n\"I think we can accomplish the goal of building 1.5 million homes while respecting our natural heritage.\"\nAsked if the review could see more land opened to housing development, Calanda said he did not want to \"presuppose\" the results of the work, but he did not rule out that further development applications could be granted.\n\"It will be a full, open and accountable process. It will look at the entirety of the Greenbelt. There might be lands that need to be added to the Greenbelt. There may be some lands that are removed, but it will be a fair and open process that will live up to the spirit of the original intent of the Greenbelt,\" he said.\nOntario has a new housing minister. But the Greenbelt is still his problem\nOntario will 're-evaluate' sites in Greenbelt land swap as part of sweeping review, Ford says\nMeanwhile, Calandra said he is considering revisions to the government's policy on Ministerial Zoning Orders (MZOs), which override local zoning bylaws. The revisions would focus on ensuring orders issued to advance the province's homebuilding targets are used for that purpose alone, he said. Calandra says other changes could include restrictions on the sale or transfer of lands obtained through MZOs, retroactive to 2018.\nStiffer penalties for developers who buy land but do not build on it could be introduced in the fall economic statement, he said, as part of the government's renewed focus on a \"use it or lose it\" policy. The housing ministry is also exploring an increase to the province's 25 per cent non-resident speculation tax.\n\"I will not be stopped on our mission of building 1.5 million more homes,\" he said.\nOpposition concerned \nCalandra was appointed in a cabinet shuffle Monday, just hours after Clark resigned the position. Clark stepped down following a damning report from the integrity commissioner that found he failed to properly oversee the process by which the ministry selected land for removal from the Greenbelt.\nThe previous Liberal government mandated in 2005 that Greenbelt lands be reviewed every 10 years. The last review was completed in 2015, meaning the province is moving up the timeline by about two years. Calandra did not say how long he expects the review will take, but the last one took about two years.\nOpposition leaders have expressed concern the review is a pretext for the provincial government to open more Greenbelt land to development.\nOntario Housing Minister Steve Clark resigns amid Greenbelt land swap controversy\nIn a statement Wednesday, NDP Leader Marit Stiles called the pending review a \"sham.\"\n\"Minister Calandra's Greenbelt review is a waste of Ontarians' time and money. And worse, it risks opening up the Greenbelt even further,\" Stiles said.\n\"We don't need another review to tell us that we need to build housing inside existing municipal areas — not on prime farmland or vital ecological habitats that lessen the impacts of climate change.\"\nStiles went on to repeat her call for the land taken out of the Greenbelt in last year's swap be returned to its protected status.\nAG's office pledges review of lobbying legislation\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Doug Downey's office said in a statement Wednesday the provincial government will prepare recommendations for improving the province's lobbying legislation and present them to a legislative committee in the fall.\n\"Following the recommendation from the auditor general, our government committed to reviewing the legislation governing lobbyists at a legislative committee, which we anticipate to start in the coming weeks,\" the statement said. \n\"Today, the premier instructed the attorney general to prepare recommendations to be presented to the committee. These include a higher degree of accountability and increased penalties for those who violate the act up to and including jail time.\"\nCBC Toronto reported last week about a development consultant to whom Integrity Commissioner J. David Wake referred to in his report as Mr. X.\nWake found Mr. X may have engaged in unregistered lobbying and other potential lobbying violations while working to help landowner Peter Tanenbaum get land he owned in Clarington, Ont., removed from the Greenbelt.

While he is sharing a bedroom, and had to crash on the couch for two nights between when his Airbnb stay ended and the former tenant moved out, he's just relieved to have a place to live.\nWATCH | Aakash Chakor describes his journey to find housing in Thunder Bay\n:\n \nThunder Bay's housing crunch hits international students hard\n7 days ago\nDuration \n2:22\nCBC's Sarah Law met up with Aakash Chakor, an international student at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ont. He's one of many who struggled to find housing before the start of the school year.\nLakehead International's vice-provost, James Aldridge, said the school expects to see more international students than ever this year. The influx is a national trend, with Immigration Minister Marc Miller estimating Canada is on track to host around \n900,000 international students this year.\nThis all comes amid debates at the provincial and federal levels over what to do about the country's housing crisis. Federal Housing Minister Sean Fraser has even suggested \na cap on international students\n to ease pressures on the market.\n\"I expect we'll end up with somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 international students here at Lakehead University this fall,\" Aldridge told CBC News in an interview.\nIn a followup email Friday, he said Lakehead will welcome about 6,500 students — including more than 1,500 international students — to its Thunder Bay campus this fall. However, a final count of the total number of international students will be done in November, he said.\nRental cost shot up but room still snapped up\nChakor, who is completing a two-year master's program in electrical and computer engineering, said he was directed to the Lakehead University Student Union, international department and off-campus website for help finding accommodation.\n\"They don't directly make any arrangements between landlords and tenants, and they don't inspect any rental units, but they provide a way for international students and local students to be directed to housing opportunities in the community,\" Aldridge explained.\nJames Aldridge is vice-provost of Lakehead International. He says if the federal government places caps on international students, they should be determined by region depending on housing availability.\n \n(Submitted by Lakehead University)\nChakor had to consider numerous aspects of housing that he wouldn't normally think about in India, like heating systems and whether a basement apartment might get too cold in a Canadian winter.\nThere are currently 1,120 beds for students in on-campus residences and the school plans to expand that to 1,160 for the 2024-2025 year, director of residence services Shannon Foster said in an email Friday.\nThe lack of on-campus housing is what pushed Chakor to search elsewhere, he said.\nOne place he and his friends viewed was listed at $2,200 per month, but after they called later to follow up, the rent had been raised to $2,500 due to high demand, he said. By the time they debated whether they could afford that, it was taken.\n\"Initially coming to Thunder Bay, I was planning to get a single room for myself, but considering the budget and the rent here, I had to lower my expectations,\" he said.\nBeware of rental scams\nOne reason Chakor didn't fully start his housing search until arriving in Thunder Bay was because of rental scams, something the school also warned him about.\nThere are notices on Lakehead's off-campus website about red flags, like landlords asking for money in advance or not allowing prospective tenants to view a unit before signing a lease. The school also holds workshops for international students throughout the year, recognizing their lack of familiarity with the local rental market, Aldridge said.\nHe was aware of two international students impacted by scams last year. Each lost around $1,000.\nDania Majid is a staff lawyer at the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario in Toronto.\n \n(Danielle Maheu/Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario)\nDania Majid, a staff lawyer for the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario, said the desperation for housing sometimes pushes students to let their guard down or care less about whether a unit is safe or legal.\n\"Some tenants are actually offering more than first and last month's rent in order to secure a rental unit in a hot market, so we can be talking thousands and thousands of dollars that are being scammed from tenants,\" said Majid.\nThe disparity between domestic and international rates for tuition also contribute to these students ending up in poorer living conditions, said Majid. Depending on their study permit, there may also be restrictions on international students' ability to work.\n\"They're coming here for an opportunity to better themselves through higher education, but are not actually getting the full experience because they're forced to work two or three jobs to cover the rent and cover the tuition that they're being forced to pay.\"\nShould international student numbers be capped?\nWhile Aldridge said he isn't surprised about Fraser's suggestion to put caps on international student numbers, he said it's important for people to remember these students didn't cause the housing crisis.\n\"I see a lot of blame going around, but at the same time, what would we all do if all of a sudden international students started disappearing or the numbers were less and we couldn't fill all of the jobs that we see being filled by [them]?\" he asked.\nShould limits on international students be put in place, Aldridge said, he hopes they're determined on a regional basis, \"so that places like Thunder Bay that still have capacity are prioritized over some of the places in larger centres that are clearly bursting at the seams with newcomers.\"\nVideo\nWhy student housing is in a crisis — and how to fix it\nWe're welcoming record numbers of international students. Here's how they got caught up in the housing crisis\nIt's a tricky balance, especially when Canada is looking to attract more immigrants to the country, with a \ntarget of 500,000 per year by 2025.\n A record-breaking 431,645 people became permanent residents in 2022.\nInternational students are strong candidates for permanent residency, Aldridge said. \n\"You can't have it both ways. We need to fix the housing crisis without stopping the flow of students who, in my opinion at least, form some of the best immigrants that we have in Canada, because they can finish a Canadian education, they speak one of our two official languages and they provide a lot of great, great things to our communities.\"\nThe role of institutions\nThere's more pressures for \neducational institutions to offer solutions\n to the housing crunch. When asked whether Lakehead University may consider building its own housing developments, Aldridge said he wasn't aware of any such plans.\n\"Student housing has been a long-time problem,\" Majid said. \"It's provincialwide and really the hotspots for those problems tend to be around educational institutions. They're accepting record numbers, but they haven't accounted for the fact that student housing has become much more scarce.\"\nCreative solutions have come at the municipal level, through bylaws that allow for multi-tenant dwellings, basement apartments and other secondary suites to increase density, she said.\nThe province has given Thunder Bay the target of \nbuilding 2,200 homes by 2031.\nIntegrity of immigration system at risk as international student numbers balloon, minister says\nColleges, universities have role to play in solving Ontario's housing crisis: report\n\"Universities should be also working with municipalities and the province in terms of encouraging them to help them secure housing that will be rented at affordable rates,\" Majid said.\nAs Chakor settles in and prepares for the first day of school, he looks forward to exploring what the city has to offer, from nature trails to shops and local restaurants.\nHis advice for other international students who just landed? Be prepared to stay in temporary accommodations for a week or more.\n\"Talk to everyone. If you find a friendly face, ask them, 'Do they know someone who wants to rent out their place?' Talk to people around [campus] because they are the people who have went through the same process.\"", "author": [{"name": "Sarah Law", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/author/sarah-law-1.6683305", "email": "sarah.law@cbc.ca", "about": "Sarah Law is a CBC News reporter based in Thunder Bay, Ont., and has also worked for newspapers and online publications elsewhere in the province.

We answer some of your questions about the situation.", "content": "The months-long Greenbelt controversy plaguing the Ontario government made waves this week following \nSteve Clark's resignation Monday\n as municipal affairs and housing minister.\nIn the days since, \nPaul Calandra has replaced Clark,\n the province has announced \nplans for a review\n, and that review could mean even more land removed from protected areas to develop homes.\nCBC has received many audience questions about the ongoing situation. Here's what you wanted to know:\nWhy is this being referred to as a land swap? \nThe Greenbelt is a vast 810,000-hectare area of protected farmland, forest and wetland stretching from Niagara Falls to Peterborough. It's meant to be permanently off limits to development.\n   \n \nHave a follow-up question or something to say? Email: ask@cbc.ca or join us live in the comments now.\n  \nThe reason the government's Greenbelt plans are being called a land swap is because when \nthe original decision was made\n in December 2022 to remove 2,995 hectares of protected lands to build housing, there were also 3,804 hectares added to the Greenbelt elsewhere.\nThe province has to offset removals from the Greenbelt because the Greenbelt Act prohibits an overall reduction in protected area. The province added 13 new river valley areas and lands in the Paris Galt Moraine, a unique landform northwest of Toronto. \n\"Ostensibly, the goal is to provide developers with an opportunity to develop land currently in the Greenbelt,\" said Chris Cochrane, an associate professor and interim chair of the department of political science at the University of Toronto Scarborough.\nAt the same time, Cochrane said the goal is to add lands to the Greenbelt that are \"less suitable for development\" — meaning it could be difficult to implement infrastructure like sewers, water or electricity.\nBut, \"the ultimate implementation of that plan didn't actually transpire as it was supposed to,\" he said.\nAs Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk \nrevealed in her report\n, a small number of real estate developers used access to a high level staffer — Clark's \nformer chief of staff Ryan Amato\n — to get the land they wanted opened up. \nOntario Housing Minister Steve Clark resigns amid Greenbelt land swap controversy\nReprimand housing minister over Greenbelt land swap: Ontario integrity watchdog\nInstead of assessing the infrastructure availability of potential sites, the team of bureaucrats making selections simply checked if they were adjacent to an already developed area, according to Lysyk's report.\nPlus, environmental advocates say simply swapping Greenbelt lands defeats the purpose of the Greenbelt. But we'll get to that next.\nWhy is the government doing this on the Greenbelt when other lands are available? \nIn February 2022,\n a provincially commissioned housing task force\n found a shortage of land is not Ontario's issue when it comes to creating more housing. \n\"Land is available, both inside the existing built-up areas and on undeveloped land outside greenbelts. We need to make better use of land,\" the report read. \nThis is something Ford has been asked about repeatedly, but he maintains the advice doesn't apply today because the province's population has grown since. \n\"You keep repeating the message,\" he said to a reporter on Aug. 11. \"I'm going to repeat our message: That was 19 months ago, 19 months ago.\"\nAccording to Ontario's first \ndemographic quarterly of 2023\n, in the 12 months leading up to April 1, 2023, the province's population increased by 504,618. The prior year's growth was significantly slower, per the quarterly, with only 222,396 new people.\nOntario Premier Doug Ford listens as Ontario’s minister of housing Steve Clark speaks during a press conference in Mississauga, Ont., Friday, Aug. 11, 2023. \n \n(Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)\nThe task force recommended Ontario meet its housing targets by increasing density in neighbourhoods with single-family homes. \nAbout two months after the task force's report, the Ford government released \na new housing plan\n that didn't include that recommendation. \n\"I value the task force report. I think they put some very bold ideas forward,\" Clark, then minister, told reporters at the time. \"Perhaps the recommendations were a bit too bold for some communities.\"\nPolitically, Cochrane says that strategy can be a challenge. \n\"That can obviously cause a lot of opposition from people who don't want higher levels of density in their neighbourhoods,\" he said. \nOntario government's Greenbelt land swap influenced by well-connected developers, AG finds\nHow developers influenced the Ford government to open up their Greenbelt land for housing\nPlus, he said, the province is almost entirely reliant on the private sector to build its new homes. And, as Lysyk's report revealed, developers were intent on unlocking Greenbelt lands. \n\"If developers don't feel that they are in a position to profit sufficiently from the development of land, they won't build houses on it,\" Cochrane said. \nWe're in a housing crisis, can't we build on the Greenbelt and then protect more land?\nThis question ties back to the purported vision of the Greenbelt land swaps. But as mentioned, environmental advocates say that wouldn't work. \n\"The whole idea of adding other land to the Greenbelt is a bit of red herring,\" said Phil Pothen, Ontario program manager with advocacy group Environmental Defence. That's because the Greenbelt is supposed to permanently protect the land that's under the greatest threat of development, he said.\nAn aerial view of protected farmland in the Duffins Rouge Agricultural Preserve in Pickering, Ont., that the provincial government has removed from the Greenbelt to allow housing development. \n \n(Patrick Morrell/CBC News)\nVictor Doyle, who led the development of the Greenbelt plan nearly 20 years ago, said it's protections were never meant to be swapped. \n\"Legislation talks about the Greenbelt never getting smaller, which has been misinterpreted to allow or provide the basis for the government to take land out in one place and move it to another,\" he said.\nTaken to its extreme, Doyle said the Greenbelt could stay the same size but keep moving, which would impact the region's environmental sustainability.\nEnvironmental advocates and critics of the land swaps have previously told CBC Toronto that protected lands provide many species with space to live and migrate, and that developing on the Greenbelt will create more car-dependent communities — something experts say can \nundermine green innovation meant to cut greenhouse emissions. \nHow does the government define affordable housing? And will the greenbelt developments include them? \nHow the provincial government defines affordable housing depends on which document you're looking at. The definition matters because developers rely on it to access \ndiscounts and exemptions\n.\nIn the 2020 Provincial Policy Statement, which provides direction on matters related to land use planning and development, it's described in multiple ways.\nFor owning, it's the cheaper of two options: \n   \nA price that ensures someone is paying no more than 30 per cent of their household's yearly income on their housing, if they're in a low- or moderate-income home. \n   \nHousing that costs 10 per cent less than the average price in the area.\n  \nFor renting, it's also the cheaper of two options: \n   \nRent that is at most 30 per cent of someone's yearly household income, if they're in a low or moderate income home. \n   \nRent that's at or below the average in the area.\n  \nHowever, in a \n2022 bill\n, affordable housing for renters is defined as any rent capped at 80 per cent of average market rent, while affordable housing for homeowners is defined as any cost of purchase less than 80 per cent of the average price. \nPrior to his resignation, Clark had said he planned to update the provincial definition this fall. A spokesperson for his replacement, Calandra, said the ministry intends to propose changes to the provincial definition of affordable housing that would tie affordability to income, bringing it in line with the 2020 policy statement. \nThe spokesperson said the ministry expects \"at a very minimum\" that 10 per cent of homes built on former Greenbelt lands be affordable. \n\"If these expectations are not met, the lands will be returned to the Greenbelt,\" Victoria Podbielski said.", "author": [{"name": "Lane Harrison", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/author/lane-harrison-1.6532455", "email": "lane.harrison@cbc.ca", "about": "Lane Harrison is a journalist with CBC Toronto.

So I dropped the fire extinguisher and then I rolled out of the machine, but I was still connected by my safety harness.\"\nPlexman said he dangled there in the harness, five metres above the ground, until the harness burned through and he fell to the ground.\nHe received third- to sixth-degree burns to 60 per cent of his body. His co-workers extinguished the flames and Plexman was quickly taken to hospital for treatment.\n\"They immediately induced me into a coma,\" he said. \"I was in a coma for 11 days, and during those 11 days, [there] were just constant surgeries.\n\"The surgeons told my family, 'Dan's got about a 13 per cent chance to live, and if he does survive, we're making plans to amputate both of his arms from above the shoulders.'\"\nBut that certainly wasn't how things turned out.\nIn fact, 14 years to the day of his workplace accident, Plexman was winning the left and right arm titles at the \nInternational Federation of Armwrestling's\n 2022 world championships in France, competing in the men's 80-kilogram disabled category.\nPlexman had first tried arm-wrestling just a few years prior to that win, in 2019, as a way to help with his injuries. The scar tissue causes his arms to contract toward his body, he explained.\n\"I go to physiotherapy very often and I'm constantly stretching,\" he said. \"I actually wear splints at night, too, to keep my arms straight because when I wake up in the morning, they're folded in.\"\nMeanwhile, Plexman had friends in Thunder Bay who were competitive arm-wrestlers. One day, he called one of them up and asked if he could stop by the next practice.\n\"I'm thinking that it might be good for me to have this opportunity where I can stretch out my arms and maybe save me going to physio one day a month or something like that,\" he said. \"And no joke, the first day I was there, I felt a camaraderie. I felt accepted.\nEastern Ontario teacher set to flex in national arm wrestling championship\n\"It felt really good to be part of a group again, and I was hooked on the sport,\" Plexman said. \"After my first practice, I went home thinking, 'This is for me,' and I was already planning on losing weight so I can get into the lower weight category for the upcoming tournament in two or three months from then.\"\nPlexman has competed in several tournaments ever since. Aside from his big victories in France in 2022, Plexman competed in this year's Canadian mationals, where he placed first in left arm and second in right arm in the 80-kilogram disabled category and third in the 80-kilogram able-bodied category.\nLater this month, Plexman is defending his world titles in Malaysia.\n\"This year, I got sponsorship,\" he said. \"The Canadian Union of Skilled Workers, they're sponsoring me to go.\n\"They're the union that I was working for — representing — when I got hurt.

The smaller SNO option would require its shower and washroom facilities to be reduced and centralized.\nThe SNO design would also have reduced storage capacity, and smaller referee change rooms and administrative areas, the report states.\nThe entire report \nis available online, as part of Monday's council agenda\n.\nSNO president Michael Veneziale told CBC News on Tuesday that he doesn't think the Chapples site has enough support for that version of the project to move forward.\n\"It's not the question of where exactly to play,\" he said. \"The question is, is it going to happen?\"\n\"In my opinion, if they if they go ahead with the Chapples plan as stated previously, there's not going to be support on council,\" Veneziale said. \"We're not going to have the money needed to build it.\n\"By going back to look at the Chapples location, it's basically just dead in the water.

All I know at this point is that there is a need for an indoor turf facility.\"\nNorthwood Coun. Dominic Pasqualino also said he had no preference for a site (the proposed Chapples location is in his ward).\n\"At the end of the day, I think that it's really important for city council to pick a direction and go with it and stick with it,\" he said. \"But it has to be sustainable.\n\"There are a lot of questions,\" Pasqualino said. \"Is the soccer community willing to pay the fees? Are the fees going to be reasonable?\n\"How much does the city want to put into all those things?

But there is another element to the health of our planet: its delicately balanced ecosystems, which are similarly threatened by human activity.  \nWe have colonized every part of the planet, often bringing with us plants and animals from home without a thought to how that might affect their new ecosystem. And that has had a toll.\nTo cite one example, we saw how Guinea grass, a non-native invasive species introduced to Hawaii in the late 1800s, helped to spread a wildfire \nthat destroyed the town of Lahaina, killing more than 100 people\n. While there were certainly other factors in play — such as high winds and a recent drought — it is an illustration of just how destructive an alien species can be even hundreds of years later. \nA \nspecial report on invasive species\n issued this week by the \nIntergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)\n found that invasive species introduced by humans — whether by accident or not — are having serious impacts around the world.\nSome of the report's highlights:\n   \n \nRoughly 37,000 alien species have been introduced by humans globally.\n \n   \n \nMore than 3,500 of these are harmful invasive alien species.\n \n   \n \nThirty-four per cent of the impacts were reported in the Americas.\n \n   \n \nTwo hundred new alien species are recorded each year.\n \n   \n \nInvasive species have played a key role in 60 per cent of plant and animal extinctions globally.\n \n   \n \nThe annual cost was roughly $423 billion US in 2019.\n \n  \nIt's important to note that not every alien species ends up becoming an invasive one. You wouldn't think of your tomato plants — which were originally cultivated in the mountains of the Andes — as being invasive. But when plants or animals (marine or terrestrial) have no natural predators, they can proliferate with impunity. \nIn Canada, there are several examples, such as the \nsea lamprey\n and \nzebra and quagga mussels\n (photo above), which were catastrophic to the ecosystems of the Great Lakes. In the case of the sea lamprey, roughly 6.8 million kilograms of lake trout were caught annually in the upper Great Lakes in the early 20th century; by the 1960s, after an explosion of the lamprey, only about 136,000 kilograms were harvested each year.\nIt's well known that the \nemerald ash borer\n, which is native to Asia, is devastating trees in Eastern Canada. But other species like feral pigs, rats and purple loosestrife are also wreaking havoc on ecosystems and uprooting biodiversity.\nSome have been intentionally introduced, while others are hitching rides on human transportation, such as mussels, which can end up on ships that contain ballast water collected from elsewhere.\nGlobal warming has also become a factor.\n\"Even without the introduction of new alien species, already established alien species will continue to expand their ranges and spread to new countries and regions,\" said Helen Roy, a co-chair of the assessment and a professor at the U.K. Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wales. \"Climate change will make the situation even worse.\"\nAs the planet warms, alien species are moving to places where they may not face the same predators. And they could go from just being an alien species to an invasive alien species.\nIntentional or not, invasive species are costing us dearly. For Peter Stoett, co-chair of the recent report and dean of social science and humanities at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, it's a question of assessing the total cost. \n\"This report itself simply looked at crop losses, forestry income losses, things that could be really reliably measured, right? Fishing, fishing stock losses, that sort of thing,\" he said. \"But it doesn't include some of the less reliable costs that are difficult to measure, like all the informal labour that goes into dealing with invasive species.\"\nThen there is the human toll from invasive \ndisease-spreading mosquitoes\n, such as those recently found in Africa, which have been behind the spread of malaria in some regions.\nThere is some good news, however: we can work on prevention. In the case of the sea lamprey, both the U.S. and Canada have a \nprogram that uses lampricides\n — pesticides that target larval sea lampreys — along with barriers that prevent the movement of adult sea lampreys further. \nAs well, Canada now has \nballast water regulations\n that prevent ships from bringing water from elsewhere and releasing it into our lake systems. While it doesn't necessarily fix the existing problem, Stoett said it can prevent something far worse from entering our waters.\nHe said it's all about having the foresight to prevent more biodiversity loss and a threat to our lives and economy.\n\"The main stress here … is the importance of prevention,\" he said. \"Prevention is so much cheaper than cure, right?\"\n— \nNicole Mortillaro\nOld issues of \nWhat on Earth? \nare \nhere\n.

The damage has been extensive, and in what could be an omen for future disasters, the insurance industry is taking drastic measures. \nRaising premiums is a predictable response in the wake of large payouts, but some of the biggest insurers are signalling it's no longer enough — they're restricting coverage or stopping it altogether. For example, State Farm, the biggest insurer in California, \nis no longer offering coverage anywhere in the state\n, which is notoriously wildfire-prone. Meanwhile, Farmers Insurance, Bankers Insurance and Lexington Insurance (a subsidiary of AIG) \nhave pulled out of \nFlorida\n, which is vulnerable not only to hurricanes but also rising sea levels. In both states, homeowners unable to find affordable rates can still buy insurance from the government, i.e. the \"insurer of last resort.\"\nClimate-related disasters are making selling insurance an increasingly risky bet. According to a report by the American Property Casualty Insurance Association and risk-analysis firm Verisk, insurers paid out about $1.03 US in claims for every $1 collected in premiums in 2022. Here in Canada, credit rating agency DBRS Morningstar has predicted \nthis year's record-setting wildfire season could lead to insurance payouts in the range of $700 million to $1.5 billion\n.\nHot and bothered: Provocative ideas from around the web\n   \n \nThe first African Climate Summit opened this week, with leaders across the continent \nasking for more financing and support to help it develop in a greener way than other continents have\n.\n \n   \nDisposable paper cups are everywhere, offering a greener alternative to styrofoam and other plastics … right?

Now, some startups are \nlooking to power planes with \"e-fuels\" made from captured CO2\n.\n   \n \nSci-fi author Jeff VanderMeer is known for bizarre novels that explore our state of \"climate weirding,\" such as \nAnnihilation \n(which was made into a movie starring Natalie Portman). \nIn this charming essay\n, VanderMeer reflects on trying to make a difference to the ecosystem in his own garden.\n \n  \nVancouver's architecture, by design, was never meant to handle extreme heat\nA woman sits on her balcony during a hot period of weather in Vancouver on July 20, 2022.\n \n(Ben Nelms/CBC)\nTwo summers ago, as Dennis Laplante baked beneath the skylights in his 1980s townhouse during a lethal heat wave, he decided the day had come to use the emergency space blankets.\nHe hauled two of them up a three-metre ladder to reach the windows. Using some curtain rods, he rigged the material against the skylights to block the sun from getting in.\n\"It was quite cheap and it worked really well,\" said Laplante, now 70, who has lived in Vancouver's Champlain Heights neighbourhood nearly half his life.\n\"The space blankets actually degraded in the sun,\" he noted. \"The following year and this year again ... we put some cardboard with aluminum foil up.\"\nExperts say much of Vancouver's architecture is uniquely vulnerable to intensifying heat in Canada because it was designed for milder weather, leaving the city with tens of thousands of buildings needing urgent upgrades. They say designers need to shift back to basic, sustainable building techniques to keep residents cool naturally, because relying on air conditioning won't be a long-term solution.\n\"We have to just think really hard about the environment and not try to conquer it, but work with it,\" said Donald Luxton, who has worked as a heritage consultant in the city for 40 years. \"And that's more, historically, how buildings were designed.\"\nIndigenous people who lived in the area — the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish) and səlil̓wətaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) peoples — understood the need to design buildings to work with the climate, based on their in-depth knowledge of the land.\nHomes had removable curtain walls — or outer coverings — to control sun exposure and air flow. Split cedar planks were used on rooftops, which could be angled or rotated to manage rain.\n\"There are these innovations of Indigenous cultures … that are meaningful as we look forward now to the changing climate and how we can keep our buildings comfortable,\" said Nancy Mackin, an architect who studies Indigenous design.\nAfter colonization, much of Vancouver's architecture used Victorian-era porches, verandas and small glass windows that reduced sun exposure and allowed for a cross-breeze, Luxton said. By the 1960s, mid-level high-rises were replacing single-family homes in the city's West End. Glass-walled condos started dominating the skyline in the 1980s, proving extremely profitable in a city known for its views. \n\"More glass was a really big, big selling point,\"\n \nsaid Sara Stevens, an associate professor of architecture at the University of British Columbia.\nThe problem with so much glass, of course, is that it allows so much heat in, which must then be offset by air conditioning.\nB.C. is experiencing more record-breaking summer heat waves, including the heat dome that killed more than 600 people in 2021. A review found most of those people were elderly, had a disability, lived in poorer neighbourhoods and did not have AC.\nLuxton and Stevens said the city can go back to basics to undo its reliance on cooling technology. Features like heavy awnings, shaded windows, reflective exterior paint and more green space can reduce sun exposure.\nIn July, the City of Vancouver launched the Resilient Apartment Retrofit Accelerator program, which offers $3.5 million in funding for landlords to pay for heat-related building upgrades.\nThe city has taken an incentive-based approach to encouraging renovations, rather than introducing hard and fast rules, because upgrades can displace residents in a city already contending with an affordability crisis.\n\"We really have to be sensitive to what we do on the rental and non-market [side], because that is where people that maybe are more vulnerable [are housed],\" said Sean Pander, the city's green and resilient buildings manager.\nAnother challenge is getting developers on board, because views still sell.\n\"The heat dome … has not translated yet into major changes in construction standards,\" said Patrick Condon, a professor of urban design at UBC.\nB.C. has committed to reducing carbon emissions in the buildings sector by 59 to 64 per cent by 2030. The Pembina Institute, a non-profit energy think-tank, has estimated the residential sector will need $1.6 billion annually in retrofit incentives for the province to meet its commitment to be net zero by 2050.\nAfter settling on his own tin-foil solution to reduce the heat inside his house, Laplante has helped an elderly friend install blackout curtains on her south-facing windows. He said he's grateful to have a fix, even if it's temporary.\n\"I have a solution,\" he said. \"There's an awful lot of people who don't, and I feel for them.\"\n— \nRhianna Schmunk\nStay in touch!\nAre there issues you'd like us to cover?

Iqaluit's opened in 2017 and became permanent in June 2020. \nNunavut's other 23 communities use a variety of systems to regulate alcohol, and in some communities alcohol is completely prohibited. \nThe Rankin Inlet store opened in December 2021. Both Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay voted through plebiscites in 2017 to open stores. Cambridge Bay's has not opened yet.\nAyaruak and others in Rankin Inlet believe that the store has led to more alcohol use in their community, and as a result, more social problems and mental health and addictions issues. \nRankin Inlet Mayor Harry Towtongie believes there's been an increase in alcoholism. He describes the situation as \"dire\" in his community.\n\"We're just desperate to find a solution, but it's not an easy thing to do and we're working very hard to somehow make a difference in this community,\" Towtongie said. \n\"The first responders, the RCMP, the nurses, mental health and anything to do with first responding is just overwhelming us right now and it's burning out the system,\" he added. \nHarry Towtongie, mayor of Rankin Inlet, said the hamlet council supports the petition.\n \n(Matisse Harvey/CBC News)\nTowtongie also noted that even if the store did close, residents can still import alcohol through the Nunavut Liquor and Cannabis Commission.\n\"It's become too easy for people to drink every day if they want to,\" Towtongie said.\nTowtongie said the hamlet council supports the petition, but also said they support the needs of whole community. \n\"There's two sides to it,\" he said. \nReducing daily limits\nPeople buying from the beer and wine store can purchase a maximum of four bottles of wine or 24 cans of beer a day, or a combination of the two. \nIn July, the hamlet passed a motion asking the territorial government to reduce the daily limits by half or reduce the store hours.\nIn a statement, the Department of Finance's director of corporate policy, Hillary Casey, said the government is considering those limits. \nFinance Minister Lorne Kusugak and officials for the department also met with the hamlet council in June. \n\"These import permit limits would apply to any unrestricted community to assist in curbing bootlegging and better controlling the supply of liquor in communities,\" Casey wrote. \nThe changes would require amendments to the Liquor Act, which would take time, Casey said. The earliest it could be done is the end of this year or early 2024. \nFinance is also conducting a legislative review of the Liquor Act, \"with the goal of making major changes to how liquor is managed in Nunavut.\"\n\"These changes will be subject to extensive community and stakeholder consultation, and ultimately, by approval from the Legislative Assembly,\" Casey wrote. \nMegan Pizzo-Lyall, who sits on the Rankin Inlet hamlet council, said closing the store might not be the answer and that more mental health and addictions treatment support is needed immediately. \n\"In an ideal world, we would have been prepared for the things that it brought,\" she said of the beer and wine store.\"It's capping Rankin's resources. And it's not like we had a lot to begin with.\"\n'We need help here, at all different levels,' said Megan Pizzo-Lyall, who sits on the Rankin Inlet hamlet council.\n \n(Sara Frizzell/CBC)\nThe Pulaarvik Kablu Friendship Centre in Rankin Inlet runs mental health and addictions programming. Pizzo-Lyall said she wants to see more funding directed to community organizations like Pulaarvik. \n\"Further to that, I want to see mental health facilities in every community,\" she said. \"We need help here, at all different levels,\" she said. \nShe points to mental health issues, trauma and the ongoing effects of colonization, residential schools, and more as reasons why her community is struggling, and more resources are needed. \n\"When you're not able to heal and work through those things, you turn to substances such as alcohol and other drugs,\" she said. \n\"We haven't fixed ourselves as a community, as people, to be able to throw alcohol into the mix.\"\nTowtongie said he looks forward to hearing back from the government about the petition.\nThe Department of Finance said it received the petition and is reviewing it. \n\"We're going to stick together. We're going to deal with it,\" Towtongie said. ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

But the BRICS is as much a team of rivals as a coherent bloc, and its two largest members — India and China — can hardly be called warm friends.\nU.S. Army soldiers watch Indian soldiers display their unarmed combat skills during an Indo-U.S. joint military exercise in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, close to the disputed border with China, on Nov. 29, 2022.\n \n(Manish Swarup/Associated Press)\nIn the past year, their armies have fought brutal clashes over a contested border in the high Himalayas. While both sides have respected an agreement to keep firearms away from the border, their troops have fought \nmedieval melees\n with axes and clubs.\nThe dispute was further inflamed when the Chinese government last week published a national map that \nclaimed parts of India\n — as well as parts of Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan, the Philippines and even Russia.\n\"Making absurd claims on India's territory does not make it part of China's territory,\" said India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\nModi holds the cards\nXi's no-show may be driven by a reluctance to compete directly with India's Modi to be the voice of the developing world.\n\"Modi has all the prerogatives of the host,\" said John Kirton, director of the G20 Research Group at the University of Toronto. \"India is the most populous country in the world [and has] just overtaken China. It's the most rapidly-growing G20 member, growing at 6 per cent this year, while China is in economic decline.\"\nMoments after congratulating the country's space agency engineers on a successful mission, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the historic landing near the moon's south pole a \"victory cry\" for a developing nation.\n \n(Punit Paranjpe/AFP via Getty Images)\nIndia is also coming into the summit riding high after a successful lunar mission. A Russian lander attempting the same feat crashed.\nHung Tran agrees that Modi holds more cards than Xi when it comes to speaking for the developing world. \n\"You have China supported by Russia and Iran pushing a more anti-U.S. and anti-Western polemic, and India offering more practical proposals to address the needs of the global South,\" he said, citing India's opposition to the EU's carbon import tax and efforts to strengthen preferential trade rules for developing countries.\nDown with the dollar\nOne goal that China, India and Russia share is breaking the dominance of the U.S. dollar in the international payments system.\nBut their motives differ. India wants to be less dollar-dependent but has no ambitions of making the rupee the new global currency. China likely wants to substitute its own renminbi for the greenback. Russia mostly just wants to weaken western sanctions.\nWATCH | More signs of a slowing Chinese economy: \nMore signs of a slowing Chinese economy\n8 days ago\nDuration \n2:03\nNew economic numbers out of China point to a slowdown in manufacturing for the fifth month in a row. Meanwhile, one of the country's biggest homebuilders is on the brink of collapse. It’s the latest in a string of negative economic news about the world’s second-largest economy.\n\"There was a huge effort to internationalize the renminbi, about six, seven years ago, that didn't really go anywhere,\" said Paul Samson, who for many years co-chaired the principal G20 working group on the global economy.\n\"The uptake has been low because it's not a free-floating currency. If you're going to rely on something for trade, you want liquidity, you want more certainty. The renminbi is not delivering that.\"\nSamson said the efforts to diversify will continue.\n\"You've seen payments even made to the IMF in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. So it's happening, but it's a marginal change,\" he said. \"It's going to take a big thing to replace the U.S. dollar. It's posturing for the time being.\"\nStill, opposition to the dollar's dominance may be the only thing the BRICS countries really agree on.\nNew faces at the table\nIn South Africa last month, the BRICS coalition announced that it was taking on six new members: Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\nThe expansion increases the BRICS presence at the G20 from five nations to seven.\n\"I do see it as a play that is timed to show the power of the BRICS coming in right now,\" said Samson. \"China really, really wanted this. I think Russia was ready to embrace it. South Africa wanted a good outcome as host. I think India and Brazil were more skeptical but they didn't stop it.\"\nXi Jinping, surrounded by leaders from Brazil, South Africa, India and Russia, takes part in a joint photo session at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on August 23, 2023.\n \n(Gianluigi Guercia via REUTERS)\nThe new members are an eclectic bunch that hardly fit the original BRICS image. Only Argentina and Ethiopia can claim to be democracies, and Ethiopia has a simmering civil war.\nThe absences are notable. Countries like Mexico, Indonesia or Nigeria would seem to be more obvious choices for a group meant to represent the world's biggest emerging economies. They were either not invited or declined to join (there are rumours that Russia vetoed Indonesia because of its support for Ukraine).\n\"Not a single one of the new members is a big emerging power,\" said Kirton. \"Argentina is rapidly going bankrupt and is fully dependent for its finances on the International Monetary Fund, and not at all on the BRICS's own tiny New Development Bank.\" \nChina hoped for more\nNiall Duggan of University College in Cork, Ireland has closely studied the BRICS since their formation in 2009.\n\"At the time in China, there was quite a bit of excitement,\" he told CBC News. \"They originally saw it as the beginning of the creation of a multipolar world.\"\nEven before its expansion, the BRICS represented 40 per cent of the world's population, while the G7 nations have less than 10 per cent. \"But it pretty quickly became clear that the Western states were able to coordinate themselves in the G20 much better than the developing states,\" said Duggan.\n\"Since the leadership of Xi Jinping, there's been an effort to strengthen the BRICS with more money put into bodies like the New Development Bank, and an attempt to use the BRICS as a grouping within forums like the G20. But none of these have been really successful. So they still see an importance for the BRICS, but it's definitely waned in terms of their ambitions.\"\nFrenemies and enemies\nThe expansion is unlikely to change that, said Duggan. \n\"You're looking at countries that have direct conflicts, [such as] Egypt and Ethiopia over the use of Nile waters,\" he said. \"You're looking at countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that have had tensions with Iran for decades.\n\"I'm not sure how much these countries will add. They will certainly add a lot of problems in terms of coherence at organizations like the G20 and WTO. They'll all come with very different positions.\"\nThe presence of Iran is also uncomfortable for democratic members like India and Brazil that are not seeking conflict with the West.\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi welcomes Russia's President Vladimir Putin ahead of their meeting at Hyderabad House in New Delhi, India on Dec. 6, 2021.\n \n(Adnan Abidi/Reuters)\n\"India in particular is taking kind of a step away from Russia and from China and moving slightly more towards the Western position,\" said Duggan.\nIndia is not about to jump feet-first into the Western camp, said the experts, but practical concerns are causing it to lean that way. Its military has long been a major buyer of Russian arms and equipment, but Russia's own desperate need for weapons in Ukraine has forced India to turn to western suppliers such as the U.S. and France. \nIndia is also seeking to benefit from the \"friend-shoring\" trend of Western companies looking to diversify away from manufacturing in China.\nJoint statement unlikely\nExperts consulted by CBC were pessimistic about the prospect of a joint statement at the end of this G20 summit. None of the ministerial meetings that precede the G20 leaders' summit have been able to produce such a joint declaration.\nDivisions are even wider than they were last year in Bali, where the members clashed on the Ukraine war but at least agreed on the Black Sea Grain Initiative to keep food exports flowing from Ukrainian ports.\nThat deal has since come apart\n — and tensions in Asia have risen too. Last month, the leaders of the U.S., Japan and South Korea came together at Camp David to announce a new security pact and issue \na joint statement condemning\n China's \"dangerous and aggressive behavior supporting unlawful maritime claims.\"\nFrom left, South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol, President Joe Biden and Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida arrive for a joint news conference on Friday, Aug. 18, 2023 at Camp David, the presidential retreat near Thurmont, Md.\n \n(Andrew Harnik/AP)\nAt the ASEAN summit on Wednesday, China's Premier Li Qiang called on Southeast Asia, Japan and South Korea to reject \"undue external influence\" — a not very veiled reference to the U.S.\n\"The key is for all of us to face up to problems, eliminate misunderstandings and manage our differences,\" he said. \"It's very important at present to oppose taking sides, bloc confrontations and a new cold war.\"\nBut the mood in Asia has clearly tilted against China.\nCanada wants the G20 to continue\nThere would be serious implications if the G20 ceased to function as a forum where big nations can sort out their differences.\n\"There is really no substitute for the G20 at that leaders' level that brings everybody together,\" said Hung Tran. \"And that's why the G20 came into being, because it fills a void.\"\nSamson said it's especially valuable for a middle power like Canada that relies heavily on trade and the international rules upon which trade depends.\n\"Canada hopes the G20 momentum continues,\" he said. \"If the G20 didn't exist, you'd need to create it.\n\"So it's absolutely in the Canadian interest to keep the G20 going as well as possible, but it is simply a very difficult environment right now.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Timeless art masterpieces. Big shiny photographs of big shiny humans.\nYou put coffee table books featuring any of the above in your living room and they say: \"These giant books I never open reflect my taste.\" But do they also say say something else? Do they, perhaps say, \"I'm boring\"?\nA new coffee table book by two Italian photographers will definitely not say that. It's designed solely to showcase the beauty of chickens.\nAs It Happens\n host Carol Off spoke with Matteo Tranchellini, and his work partner, Moreno Monti, about their unusual book called \nCHICken\n, which they funded through a Kickstarter campaign. \nHere is part of their conversation.\nMatteo, why did you decide to photograph these beautiful chickens?\nThis is our passion because we have a studio in Milano with a little garden. We want to have some pets. We decide to buy some chicken, some little chicken, beautiful chicken — a cocincina —​ not a popular chicken.\nWhen we buy the chicken, we contact the farmer and the farmer invite us to photograph some chicken in an exhibition.\nThe work start in the exhibition because we start to photograph some chicken and we understand this animal is incredible —​ like model. \n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nBut these are like vogue fashion art pictures of these chickens. These are exquisite.\nYeah, because when the farmer asked us to photograph the chicken we realized that chickens are like model — top models. In this moment, we understand that the shooting is very different from the start of the work.\nWe are interested in the beauty of this animal. In this exhibition, there was many, many chickens. We choose some chickens.\nWhen we start with one exhibition we wanted to go to another one and another one, more. When we had 300 photographs of many, many chickens, we realized we had many material to make … we don't know what. \nA book —​ finally, yes. You have just the most amazing chickens. Did you know there were so many different kinds?\nNo. We discovered at the exhibition. We don't know so much about chicken, rooster and everything. We discovered many, many people are passionate about this animal. We were in front of the top models. \n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nHow much co-operation did you get from these chickens?\nWhen the chicken was on the stage they stay five, 10 minutes maximum, because there was the flash, the camera, people around. The chicken make what they want. After 10 minutes, it's impossible to shoot them.\nDo you think they liked having all this attention?\nI think yes, because you can see on the picture. They are like a star, an actress, a model. You can see in every animal the character of the animal. \n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nThey strut quite a bit. Did you get roosters or just chickens?\nMany rooster and many chicken. Half and half, I think.\nDid any of your models become dinner?\nNo, no, no. Absolutely no. This kind of chicken are only for beauty.\nDid you harvest their eggs?\nYes, yes. Not too much because the selection is only for the beauty. \n \n(Moreno Monti and Matteo Tranchellini)\nNow, I saw a video of you and your partner, of you and Moreno, and you were speaking chicken to one another. You talk chicken?\nAbsolutely.\nAlright, can you speak chicken for us?\nYes.\n(Moreno Monti joins conversation: \n\"\nMoooh-bah-bow-bow-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bow-moh-moh-bah-bah-bow-bow\n.\")\nThat's wonderful! They have taught you many, many words these chickens.\nYou understand?\nCompletely.\nWritten by John McGill. Interview produced by Anna Cianni. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

It will mark the second time since 2021 that the Canadian Football League championship game will be held at the venue.\nBut in 2021, the CFL was just coming out of the global pandemic, which forced the league to cancel the 2020 campaign. Social-distancing protocols back then resulted in a drastically reduced Grey Cup festival.\nThis year, there will be over 40 events during Grey Cup week, from Nov. 13 to Nov. 19.\n\"Hamilton is the heart and soul of the 2023 Grey Cup Festival, which is our opportunity to show the country what makes our city so special,\" Scott Mitchell, chief executive officer and managing partner of Hamilton Sports Group, said in a statement.\n\"Support from the Province of Ontario has paved the way for us to incorporate the accommodations and world-class entertainment facilities in Niagara — and to connect everything and everyone with free, safe and reliable shuttle services that will run from Niagara Falls to downtown Hamilton during the festival.\"\nConcerts, parties, flag football game planned\nFrom Nov. 16 to Nov. 18, James Street North will be closed to vehicles between York Boulevard and Wilson Street, allowing people to access the John Weir Foote Armoury, a hub for several public events. There will be entertainment, free of charge, available for fans.\nThe Canadian Armed Forces Fan Zone at the Armoury will feature a specially constructed 35-yard turf football field, complete with stands and a scoreboard. It will host the Hamilton Flag Football Classic, a multi-day tournament run by Football Ontario.\nMeanwhile, the Hamilton Convention Centre, FirstOntario Centre and Bridgeworks event space will also stage a number of team parties for all nine CFL teams, with TigerTown located at the FirstOntario Centre along with a concert series. The annual CFL Alumni Association Legends Luncheon will take place Nov. 17 at LiUNA Station, and – unsurprisingly to most Hamiltonians – the Stipley neighbourhood, near the stadium, will host a game day block party.\nThe Hamilton Santa Claus Parade has been moved to Nov. 18 to be part of the Grey Cup Festival.\n\"As Mayor, and as a lifelong fan, I'm so excited to see the Grey Cup return to Hamilton again this November,\" said Andrea Horwath in the release. \"I can't wait to welcome football fans from across the country as we cheer on our teams to victory.

Parliament disagreed, very loudly.\nJohnston argued that existing institutions — including the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians and the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency — could, along with his own contributions, bring clarity and accountability to a discussion dominated by sensational headlines and wild accusations. And it's possible that both bodies will still report back with something useful.\nDavid Johnston presents his report on foreign interference in Ottawa on May 23, 2023.\n \n(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\nBut Johnston ultimately was doomed by who he was (Johnston's family and the Trudeau family are at least acquainted) and what he was not (the opposition parties were unwilling to settle for anything less than a public inquiry).\nAfter Johnston's resignation, the Liberal government was finally compelled to launch discussions with the opposition parties about an inquiry. Those negotiations apparently dragged on — perhaps in part because several individuals \nreportedly turned down the government's entreaties\n to lead such an investigation in the wake of Johnston's thrashing in the public square.\nIn hindsight, it's obvious the Liberals could have saved themselves, and the country, a great deal of time and trouble by launching an inquiry very soon after the first intelligence leaks and allegations appeared in media reports.\nBut while everyone waited for an inquiry to be launched, the headlines dried up and the opposition parties seemed only too happy to drop the issue. Maybe that was out of respect for the all-party discussions happening behind closed doors. Maybe it was because, as it turned out, voters were altogether more concerned with the cost of housing.\nIn the fading light of late summer, Hogue's appointment almost seems anticlimactic — and it is tempting to dismiss this spring's turmoil as a passing fad. But of course, it isn't.\nHow foreign interference tests our democracy\nForeign interference, either real or alleged, is ultimately a test of a \npolitical system's seriousness\n — a test not only of the system's ability to counter and resist meddling but of the capacity of political actors to deal with suspicions, fears, threats and allegations. And the early returns from this particular episode have not flattered Canada's political system.\nJustice Hogue's terms of reference are expansive and the government has committed to giving her access to any documents she seeks. Her timeline is tight but it might be just enough to get at the questions raised by the series of media reports that caused such tumult this past spring.\n\"The terms of reference were deliberately written to give the inquiry and the commissioner the ability to follow the evidence,\" LeBlanc said Wednesday.\nJustice Marie-Josée Hogue has a tight timeline for completing her work.\n \n(Université de Sherbrooke)\nThe questions to be answered are by now obvious. What do intelligence agencies know about attempts by foreign states to interfere in Canadian democracy? How well is that information distributed within the government? What have elected officials and senior civil servants known about any attempts to interfere? And given what they knew, did they do enough to respond?\nThere is a risk here for both the government and its accusers — that an inquiry will find the government was derelict in its duty or that the biggest allegations are lacking in substance.\nBut the immediate political consequences are still secondary to the need for accountability, clarity and seriousness. Hogue's broader remit is to resolve, one way or another, the suspicion and doubts that have been raised and stoked about Canada's political process. Even if Canadians are rather more concerned with paying their mortgages or rent, the forces of suspicion and doubt can prove corrosive over time.\nParliament may have decided, in its infinite wisdom, that it was incapable of seriously handling such important matters. But there is some small grace in the fact the parties were at least capable of agreeing, belatedly, to outsource the responsibility to Hogue.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The 33-year-old Swede became the first player at the position to record 100 points in a season since Brian Leetch in 1991-92.\nWATCH | Karlsson records 100th point of season:\nKarlsson becomes 6th D-man in NHL history to notch 100-pt season\n5 months ago\nDuration \n1:05\nErik Karlsson scored his 25th goal of the year to become the first defencemen in over 30 years to reach the 100-point milestone.\nThe complicated trade included the Canadiens to make sure the deal was salary cap compliant. Karlsson has four years left on his contract at a cap hit of $11.5 million US — $1.5 million of which San Jose will retain through the end of the deal in 2027. The Penguins, meanwhile, will hold on to $1.56 million of Petry's salary.\n\"It's been kind of a long grind throughout not only the regular season but the summer to get this done,\" Sharks general manager Mike Grier said on a video call with reporters. \"We've been going at it for a while trying to get this done with a few teams. Kyle's been pretty upfront and aggressive for the last couple months, but it's been a little bit of a grind.\"\nAs part of the trade, the Penguins also received forward Rem Pitlick, prospect Dillon Hamaliuk and San Jose's 2026 third-round pick. The Sharks also got Mike Hoffman from the Canadiens.\nKarlsson's decorated career\nKarlsson, who also won the Norris in 2012 and 2015, is going to his third NHL organization. He played his first nine seasons with the Ottawa Senators before he was traded to San Jose in 2018.\nIn 987 regular-season and playoff games, Karlsson has 814 points — the most of any defenceman since he broke into the league in 2009. He has not appeared in the playoffs since 2019 and will now be an important part of trying to get Crosby, Malkin, defenceman Kris Letang and the Penguins back into the mix in the East after their 16-year playoff streak ended last season, prompting major front office changes.\nThe team fired President of Hockey Operations Brian Burke and general manager Ron Hextall in the aftermath and owner Fenway Sports Group turned the keys over to Dubas.\nPenguins hire Kyle Dubas as president of hockey operations\nHe was given the mandate to maximize whatever championship window remains for while Crosby, Malkin and Letang are still on the roster. The trio won the Stanley Cup together in 2009, 2016 and 2017 but the going has been far tougher in recent years.\nPittsburgh hasn't won a postseason series since the opening round of the 2018 playoffs, and it found itself on the outside looking in for the first time since 2006 following a late slide that included a loss to lowly Chicago in the final week, a setback that essentially served as the death knell for the longest active playoff streak in major North American sports.\nThe team's cornerstones are all on the far end of their 30s. Malkin is 37, Letang is 36 and Crosby turns 36 on Monday. They'll be joined by the 33-year-old Karlsson, a dynamic scorer who can sometimes be a liability at the other end of the ice.\nDubas' pursuit of Karlsson began shortly after free agency began on July 1, though it took time for all of the pieces to come together.\nMore NHL coverage\nThe trade does rid the Penguins of Granlund — a non-factor after coming over in a puzzling deal at the trade deadline last season — and Petry, who missed more than 20 games due to injury and struggled with consistency when he was in the lineup.\nPittsburgh's reconfigured blue line now includes Karlsson, Letang and Ryan Graves, who signed a six-year deal last month. DeSmith's departure leaves Tristan Jarry — who agreed to a surprising five-year contract to stay in town — as the only goalie on the roster with experience in coach Mike Sullivan's system.\nThe Penguins were the NHL's oldest team last season, a spot they figure to retain when the puck drops against Chicago on Oct. 10.\nYet with three players who are likely destined for the Hall of Fame entering the twilight of their careers, Dubas is banking on his active summer helping his team close the gap that has opened between the Penguins and the contenders in a loaded East.\nThe Sharks are going the other way, tearing down after missing the playoffs each of the past four seasons. They took on significant salary for next season and 2024-25 but by only retaining 13 per cent of Karlsson's contract opened themselves up to be big spenders two years from now when closer to contending.\n\"Having the ability to have some cap flexibility and financial flexibility was really important for us moving forward,\" Grier said. \"Clearing that cap space and having the flexibility to get involved to make some moves down the line was one of the main priorities of this deal.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

We've just removed a live worm from this patient's brain,'\" Senanayake told Australian Broadcasting Corp.\nChanges in her brain\nIn January 2021, the patient was admitted to her local hospital in southeast New South Wales state after having symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, a dry cough and night sweats, for three weeks. \nShe was initially treated, but some of her symptoms persisted. Last year, she was again admitted to the hospital after experiencing forgetfulness and worsening depression over three months. Scans showed changes in her brain.\nSenanayake said the brain biopsy was expected to reveal a cancer or an abscess.\n\"This patient had been treated ... for what was a mystery illness that we thought ultimately was [an] immunological condition because we hadn't been able to find a parasite before and then out of nowhere, this big lump appeared in the frontal part of her brain,\" Senanayake said.\n\"Suddenly, with [Bandi's] forceps, she's picking up this thing that's wriggling. She and everyone in that operating theatre were absolutely stunned,\" Senanayake added.\nA magnetic resonance image of the patient’s brain shows a right frontal lobe lesion, which is where the worm was located.\n \n(Emerging Infectious Diseases)\nThe worms' eggs are commonly shed in snake droppings. \nSmall mammals then eat the droppings and the life cycle continues as other snakes eat the mammals. The woman lives near a carpet python habitat and often goes there to gather spinach-like vegetation called warrigal greens to cook.\nWhile she had no direct contact with snakes, scientists believe that she consumed the eggs from the vegetation or her contaminated hands.\nAfter the worm was removed, the patient was given other medications to get rid of any other potential larvae that could be growing in her other organs. \nLISTEN | Dr. Sanjaya Senanayake on the worm discovery :\nAs It Happens\n6:17\nHow an Australian woman ended up with a parasitic worm in her brain\nSix months post-surgery, the researchers say the woman's mental symptoms have continued, but improved. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Senanayake says they continue to monitor the woman's condition and keep in touch with her.  \nThe \nOphidascaris \nspecies can infect snakes outside of Australia, so the authors said they assume that \"additional human cases may emerge\" in other parts of the world. \n'Pretty wild case' \nDr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease physician in Toronto, said this is a \"pretty wild case.\" \nHe said this is a \"unique infection\" because the person accidentally ingested python feces that had the parasite. \n\"But in terms of people getting infections through close contact with non-human animals, obviously that's a big issue and certainly we're seeing more and more of that,\" he told CBC News. \nBogoch said these are specifically called zoonotic infections, which can be viral, bacterial or parasitic. \nThe larval form of Ophidascaris robertsi, an Australian roundworm, was not previously known to be a human parasite. They are commonly found in carpet pythons.\n \n(Emerging Infectious Diseases)\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates \n75 per cent of emerging diseases\n in humans start in animals. \nSome prominent examples of this, according to Bogoch, are the flu and COVID-19. \n\"There's a whole myriad of parasitic infections that are out there, mostly we don't see a lot of them in Canada,\" he said.\nBogoch added that there are some infections people can get locally in Canada and others that people bring into the country from abroad. \n\"If we're talking about zoonotic infections, we have to be very concerned about the communicable ones,\" he said, adding that those are ones that can transfer between people. \nIsaac Bogoch is an infectious diseases physician in Toronto. He says this case is unique and doesn't pose a public health risk. \n \n(Maggie MacPherson/CBC)\nBogoch said that early detection, early response and surveillance are important to detect these infections and prevent their spread. \nWith this particular parasitic infection, Bogoch said the woman couldn't have transferred it to another person, so it's not something to be concerned about. \n\"This is a startling infection, but the world does not need to worry about an outbreak of this infection,\" he said. \n\"It's certainly an impressive case and it's not every day that a neurosurgical team will pull a live worm out of someone's brain, but let's not pretend for a second that there's a broader public health risk.\" \nIn Ontario, worries of an even deadlier pandemic start with chickens\nTo avoid getting a zoonotic infection, Bogoch said that people should not mistakenly or intentionally consume animal feces, as that's how diseases can be transmitted. \nFor people who work with animals or have a pet, Bogoch recommended washing your hands. He also said people eating meat, like pork or beef, should make sure it's well-cooked. ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) said it's investigating this case as well as \"any systemic issues that may be at the root of it.\"\nHHS has reported another 10 privacy breach cases to the IPC in 2023, the IPC confirmed to CBC Hamilton. Four of those cases also involved employees snooping or looking at records out of curiosity. The IPC did not provide details about the other six cases. \nHHS fires 8 employees who 'snooped' through records of 4,000 patients\nOf the four other snooping cases, half are still being investigated and half are completed, said HHS spokesperson Wendy Stewart.

For example, that may include if someone was snooping information about a particular disease or surgery, and then shared it to cause the patient embarrassment or get them fired from their job. \n\"The fact that it's not necessarily criminal doesn't mean there couldn't be some legal recourse,\" Scassa said.\nImpacted patients who decided to pursue action through the courts could find out more details about anyone who  accessed their information and why, during the discovery phase of the legal process, Scassa said. \n\"That starts to run up the bills for the people affected as well,\" she said.\nMore than 200 people affected by privacy breaches at Nova Scotia Health\nThe IPC said it cannot comment on this most recent case as its investigation is in progress.

Lately, he says he's seen an increase in number of patients who are symptomatic with COVID-19.\nThat trend, coupled with a change in people's social behaviour with the return to school and the colder weather ahead, has him concerned, he says.\n\"That constellation of ingredients is going to lead to a very bad-tasting cake,\" said Vinh.\nAccording to data collected by Quebec's institute of public health (INSPQ), the average level of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Montreal's wastewater has been on the rise since mid-August, though levels remain overall low.\nLast week, just under 2,000 new cases were recorded in the province. On Tuesday, in Montreal there were 192 people being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals, including five people who are in intensive care. \nThe rise in COVID cases is happening as many people have waning immunity, with their last booster coming more than six months ago, said Vinh. \nAccording to Quebec's Health Ministry, an updated vaccine booster will be available in October. \nWant a COVID-19 booster? Experts say most Canadians should wait for updated shots\nTo decrease the rate of the spread, Vinh suggests people wear a mask in crowded areas, make sure those areas are properly ventilated and get tested if they feel symptomatic. \nWhere to find a test\nRapid tests are available free of charge to anyone who wants one at Quebec's various vaccination and screening centres.  \nSome pharmacies also offer free tests but these are reserved for vulnerable and at-risk members of the population, people covered by Quebec's public drug plan, youths age 14 to 17 and full-time students up to the age of 25. \nMembers of the general public can still purchase tests at certain pharmacies for a price ranging between $6 and $10 per test.

He says healthy people should stay home and take care of themselves if they're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. \nDr. Vinh disagrees, adding that testing is vital to tracking the virus' spread. He says he hopes the Health Ministry will adjust its policy accordingly and widen the distribution of rapid tests in anticipation of high community transmission. \nCurrently there are around 65 million rapid tests in Quebec's warehouses according to the Health Ministry.

Analysts say the tour is generating millions of dollars for local economies.\n \n(Kevin Winter/TAS Rights Management/Getty Images)\nAnd it's not just the concerts that are generating money. \n\"These are people who are coming from all across Canada, and so that means you're going to have people here who are ready to spend,\" said Tsai.\n\"You're bringing your family and you're going to go out, have meals and really spend big money to enjoy the moment.\"\nSo how much money is \"big money\"?\n\"Probably in the range of $600 to maybe even $800 million Canadian being generated,\" he said.\n\"Your spend in the stadium is one thing, but what you do outside of that will be even greater because you have to consider that hotels, for instance, have doubled ... what they're asking for in some cases,\" he added. \n'Swift-onomics': When a tsunami of Swifties crashes into Toronto, it will leave an economic boost in its wake\nVideo\nEconomic boost follows Taylor Swift's Eras Tour\nAnd while concert films — movies attached to an artist's tour — aren't exactly new, it's something that's having a bit of a moment right now, according to Sydney Urbanek, a culture critic who writes the pop star-centric newsletter Mononym Mythology.\nEarlier this month, Metallica's M72 World Tour burst onto the big screen at Canadian cinemas as part of two live broadcasts from Arlington, Texas. \nExperiencing concerts through film\n\"Pop music has a huge history of being in theatres, whether you're talking about\n A Hard Day's Night \nand all The Beatles films in the '60s or, you know, \nPurple Rain\n in '84,\" said Urbanek. \nThe resurgence of films centered around concerts can be traced back to Canadian pop star Justin Bieber's \nNever Say Never, \nwhich premiered in 2011, she said. \nThe movie followed Bieber during the 10 days leading up to his performance at Madison Square Garden. \nSince then, we've seen stars throughout the 2010s like Katy Perry, One Direction and even Celine Dion, try their hand at the concert movie. \nBut as streaming sites became more popular, the trend of concert films being released in theatres slowed. \nWATCH | Why more musicians are scheduling concert tours with multiple nights:\nMusicians embracing mini-residencies over mega tours\n15 days ago\nDuration \n2:21\nPost-pandemic, more musicians are scheduling concert tours with multiple nights at one venue instead of a wide-reaching tour. Some say the approach is easier for the artist and can save costs, but it’s not the same as meeting fans where they live.\nUrbanek points to examples like Beyoncé's \nHomecoming \non Netflix, Kendrick Lamar's \nThe Big Steppers \nTour \non Amazon Prime and even Taylor Swift's earlier concert film from her Reputation tour, which appeared on Netflix. \nBut now, concert films releasing in theatres appear to be making a comeback, said Urbanek. \n\"It's like we're getting back in the direction of another one of those waves,\" she added.\nThe unique thing about the Eras tour movie, says Urbanek, is its timing. The movie is set to release on Oct. 13. Setting aside the fact the 13 is famously Swift's favourite number, Urbanek noted another interesting aspect at play. \n\"That's more than a year before the tour will end. So Canadians will get to see this concert film a whole year before she brings the show to Canada,\" she said. \n\"It might turn out to mean that the show is about to be tweaked.\" \nThese mysteries are all part of what experts say has become a winning marketing strategy for Swift. \nMarketing 'genius' \nFrom hidden meanings behind lyrics, to anagrams, to cryptic social media posts, Swift has always kept her fans guessing about what's coming next. \nOne 2021 post from Swift's Instagram, for example, teased song titles from \"the vault\" — new tracks on re-released \nFearless (Taylor's Version) \nalbum.\n\"She's always been very good at doing Easter eggs ... doing things that feel like they're really made for the fans,\" said Urbanek. \n\"She's a genius at social media marketing,\" Tsai told CBC News. \nAnd this combination tour and film is no different. \n\"She's talked about how she wants them [fans] to wear Eras tour attire, friendship bracelets,\" said Urbanek. \"So there's definitely this feeling that she's ... trying to replicate the experience of the show with this film.\"\nThe pop megastar will be in Toronto for six concerts over a 10-day period at the Rogers Centre in 2024.\n\"It's like our Super Bowl, it's our Olympics all rolled in one, all centred around Taylor Swift,\" added Tsai. ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

First Nations people in B.C. died at nearly six times the rate of other residents last year, according to data from the First Nations Health Authority in B.C.\nWhy letting users know what's in the drugs they're taking is important as opioid deaths rise\nWith the toxic drug supply continuing to claim thousands of lives across Canada every year, experts, advocates, and drug users are drawing attention to a growing demand for harm-reduction services — like drug checking and doctor-prescribed substances, called safer supply — that are currently only available in a select few communities.\nThis International Overdose Awareness Day, there are\n 123 events and marches \nacross Canada — and hundreds more worldwide — to commemorate the lives lost and call for action. \nTechnicians at the Spectrum drug-checking site on Jasper Avenue in Edmonton use a spectrometer to analyze drug samples, including opioids and stimulants. \n \n(Ty Ferguson/CBC)\nMore demand for drug checking\nBruce Wallace, a professor at the University of Victoria and co-lead of the university's drug checking project, and Hayley Thompson, manager of Toronto's drug check program run out of St. Michael's Hospital, found the toxicity of substances on the street were further exacerbated during pandemic-induced lockdowns. \n\"We started to see that there are often what we would call multiple actives,\" Wallace said. \"Most opioids were then combined with some other drugs.\"\nThese include high potency benzodiazepines, fentanyl analogues like fluorofentanyl, and in smaller quantities, xylazine, an animal sedative that has been detected in recent years across North America's drug supply.\nBruce Wallace, professor at the University of Victoria and co-lead of the university's drug-checking project, says there is not enough access to harm-reduction services during the worsening overdose crisis.\n \n(Mike McArthur/CBC)\nAccording to Wallace and Thompson, drug checking in B.C. is more prevalent than elsewhere in Canada. The\n province has 25\n Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers for drug checking, with several in each health authority. Other provinces have had this service either in their largest municipalities or not at all.\n \n\"We've actually been the only drug-checking service in the province [of Ontario] up until this year,\" Thompson said.\n\"There's [now] one in Thunder Bay and there's one in Peterborough and we know there are a number of other municipalities that are getting them up and running, but they're not receiving funding from the Ontario government to do so. They're doing it independently.\"\n \nIn 2016, when the public health crisis was declared by the province, it was never an expectation that we'd still be in the same spot so many years later.\n- Bruce Wallace, University of Victoria\nWallace thinks the declaration of a public health emergency has been helpful for drug checking in B.C., as well as prompted regular data gathering and other harm-reduction measures in the province.\n\"It would have been harder for us to be able to implement things like overdose prevention sites and decriminalization and drug checking without the declaration, I believe,\" said Wallace, who is also a scientist with the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research.\nWATCH | Drug checking in Alberta: \n‘If they are using substances, they know what’s in their substances’\n1 month ago\nDuration \n2:37\nA first-of-its kind drug checking site opened in Edmonton allowing users to have their substances tested before they are consumed. Technicians can test a range of drugs for toxic substances and levels. Once the drugs are tested, users are alerted to the contents in person, by phone or email.\nToronto has a Health Canada-funded program that operates out of five supervised consumption sites, and local initiatives exist in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island. \n\"The demand for our service is definitely increasing,\" said Thompson. \"We get calls from people or organizations all over the province and country, who are like, 'How do I get this in my community?'\"\nIn the past year, the Victoria drug-checking project has developed a new method to reach smaller communities in central Vancouver Island; so far in 2023, this region has had the second highest rate of drug poisoning deaths in B.C. after Vancouver, according to B.C. Coroners Service data.\nCBC Investigates\nThousands of Canadian drug users dying as government red tape limits help, advocates say\nThe method, which Thompson says is ahead of the game while Ontario facilities await long-term funding, involves training front-line workers in smaller central Vancouver Island communities to collect drug samples, usually at an overdose prevention site, and sending them to a technician in Victoria for analysis.\nIt uses new technology developed by the UVic drug checking project and eliminates the need for a skilled technician in a rural community, but the turnaround time can be a couple of days, versus 20 minutes in Victoria.\nFew have access\nDrug checking and collecting data about drug-poisoning deaths, like B.C. does, is an important step to help drug users make an informed decision about their consumption, experts said, but is not enough on its own.\n\"We have more data in B.C. and more routine reporting of everything but to continually report how bad the situation is obviously doesn't respond to the situation,\" Wallace said.\n\"In 2016, when the public health crisis was declared by the province, it was never an expectation that we'd still be in the same spot so many years later.\"\nThe death rate has more than doubled since the public health emergency declaration 2016, and now stands at 42 per 100,000 in B.C — making unregulated drugs the leading cause of death in B.C. for people aged 10 to 59, according to the B.C. Coroners Service.  \n\"Despite recommendations for the urgent expansion of a safer drug supply, very few have access to a stable, lower-risk alternative,\" said the province's chief coroner, Lisa Lapointe, in a \nstatement on Aug. 29\n. \nB.C. reports that in June 2023, 4,619 people were prescribed safer supply opioid medications.\nDecriminalization, safe supply already saving lives in B.C., contrary to backlash claims: addictions minister\nOpioid death rates tripled for Ontario teens, young adults since 2014, research shows\nBut experts say these and other harm reduction measures are not available on wide enough scales to have a more tangible impact. \n\"We learned through the decades of [data from] supervised injection sites like Insite, [that] having a dozen booths to serve a whole health authority was really a limited response,\" Wallace said. \"You just can't expect that to really reach the range of people and I think we also have that challenge with drug checking.\"\nIn Vancouver, advocates and health officials have decried t\nhe city's decision to not renew\n the lease of an overdose prevention site in downtown, meaning the facility has until March 2024 to find a new location.\nOverdose consumption sites in Ontario are\n undergoing a critical incident review\n after a woman was killed in a shooting outside the South Riverdale Community Health Centre in Toronto in July. \n\"It's a much different political landscape [in Ontario],\" Thompson said. \"Also the number of consumption treatment services in Ontario was capped by the Ford government a number of years ago.\"\nThe\n province's revised strategy\n under Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government in 2018 limited the number of supervised consumption sites allowed in Ontario to 21.\nWATCH | What's standing in the way of more supervised consumption sites: \nSafe inhalation sites save lives. Bureaucracy makes them hard to build\n2 months ago\nDuration \n5:50\nThe majority of opioid overdose deaths in Canada — as much as two-thirds in some provinces — are now caused by smoking drugs, but government red tape is slowing efforts to save lives. The CBC’s Jonathon Gatehouse explores why it's so difficult to get safe smoking sites approved.\nSupply and demand\nIt's difficult for either Thompson or Wallace to say for sure why the drug supply is getting more dangerous, but they have several theories.\nOne, Thompson said, is that xylazine has been introduced into the drug supply as an alternative to benzodiazepines due to ease of access — it is used in veterinary care and is therefore readily available.\n'Extremely concerning': Two northern Ontario safe consumption sites fear closure\n\"There's also this theory of the 'Iron Law of prohibition,' which is that as more measures are put in place to try and crack down on the unregulated drugs supply, whether that's the scheduling of drugs, so making them harder to import, or whether it's police intervention to cut drugs out of the supply…new drugs will continue to pop up when that happens,\" Thompson said. \"And often, they will be more potent in an effort to try and evade detection.\"\nThe current mix of substances means those who rely on street drugs have developed multiple addictions, said Keeler. Through his outreach work, he says he has heard people are having more trouble accessing prescribed safer supply these days.\n\"I'm seeing that people are getting cut off of safe supply more than getting put back on it,\" Keeler said, adding his belief that doctors are unwilling to prescribe the large doses needed for people in active addiction. \"I think [governments] need to put money towards practicums for nurses to walk around with us … so that they're able to to understand how to better help with the fentanyl crisis.\"\nAccording to Thompson and Wallace, compassion clubs like the Drug Users Liberation Front in Vancouver — through which people who use drugs purchase substances in large quantities, have it checked, and then disseminate them — are another grassroots-level initiative created to save lives during the toxic drug crisis.\nThey had access to a safe supply as health-care workers. That's why they want the same for others\nBut due to the level of personal risk, political landscapes, and availability of street substances that are in demand, compassion clubs are not considered a scalable solution at the moment. \n\"A lot of these responses can be useful but they're limited and they're not having a meaningful impact unless they can be really scaled up and reach the overall population of people who are using drugs and at risk of overdose,\" Wallace said. ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Here are 13 Canadian contenders\nIt was the beginning of an incredibly successful collaborative relationship, as Timbaland would go on to co-produce, co-write and feature on Furtado's third album, 2006's \nLoose\n, and the two would hop on the megahit \"Give it to Me\" together with Justin Timberlake in 2007. The aughts were a magical time for all three artists, and the trio was explosive when they merged their talents.\nNow, 16 years later, \nwe have a second single\n from Furtado, Timbaland and Timberlake: \"Keep Going Up,\" a preview to Timbaland's \nupcoming fall album\n, and his first solo single in eight years.\nTo celebrate this unexpected reunion, we looked back at Furtado and Timbaland's collaborative timeline to revisit songs that will never leave our playlists.\n'Get Ur Freak On (Remix)' (2000)\nBefore Timbaland and Furtado teamed up to make original music together, the two worked on a pair of remixes. In 2000, following the release of \nWhoa, Nelly!\n, Furtado hopped on a remix of the Timbaland-produced Missy Elliott hit \"Get Ur Freak On.\" Given the pop nature of her own music, Furtado notes that \"Get Ur Freak On\" was her \"\nfirst 'street' hit\n\" that showcased her pseudo rap skills. \"Putting that out was important, and it did really well,\" Furtado told \nthe Fader\n. If winning a Grammy Award off her debut album didn't raise her profile enough, Furtado's feature on \"Get Ur Freak On\" placed the singer on some even bigger stages, including the \nMTV Video Music Awards\n and the TV concert special \nMichael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration\n. \n— Melody Lau \n'Turn Off the Light (Remix)' (2000)\nThe original version of \"Turn Off the Light\" was one of Furtado's biggest hits at the time, and it was a crunchy blend of folk-pop with a sprinkling of a hip-hop groove. However, when Timbaland and rapper Ms. Jade jumped on a remix, the song was injected with bouncy beats and reassembled into a club-ready banger. Stripping away the ominous hums at the beginning of the song might seem like a small change, but it shifted the vibe of the track and made it lighter. Timbaland's re-worked intro featured the similar truncated \"womp\" sounds featured in the opening of Ginuwine's 1996 hit \"Pony,\" which Timbaland also produced. \"I really, really want you to see me/ so baby don't turn off the lights girl,\" he sings at the beginning, transforming Furtado's original theme of feeling inhibited in the bedroom into an empowerment jam. Instead of sounding frustrated with herself and wanting to disappear into the darkness, \"Whose gonna turn off the light?\" feels like an invitation to a late-night tryst thanks to Timbaland's magic touch. \n— Natalie Harmsen\n'Promiscuous' (2006)\nIt's impossible to pick only one song from \nLoose\n, the chart-topping 2006 album that Furtado and Timbaland worked on so closely together, so we've picked two (see below). \"Promiscuous\" was the lead single for \nLoose\n, and the instant club hit became Furtado's \nfirst No. 1 hit on the Billboard charts\n, and longest-standing so far. Before the beat drops, Furtado asks, \"Am I throwing you off?\" and stakes her claim as the lead on the track. Timbaland's confident return — \"Nope\" — steers the two into a verse-for-verse swap that's flirtatious, sexy and respectful.   \n\"I remember being a bit shy to put it out,\" Furtado told the Fader, of the song. \"That was probably the content, the fact that it's called 'Promiscuous.' I hadn't done anything wrong but women are always judged. I've since changed my mind about that. By the time 'Promiscuous' came out, I was super happy. I always felt like the male and female voices were equals. It was created in that tradition of a TLC or a Salt-N-Pepa song, where the women are assertive and just like, 'I'm OK with my sexuality.'\" \nThe video for \"Promiscuous,\" helmed by Toronto's award-winning Director X, would also tease Furtado's upcoming 2007 hit single: Justin Timberlake made a silent cameo. \n— Holly Gordon\nQ with Tom Power\nDirector X on his Walk of Fame star, the power of meditation, and the legacy of Northern Touch\n'Say it Right' (2006)\nFrom the very first second of \"Say it Right,\" it's evident that Furtado and Timbaland had a polished, seismic bop on their hands. The song's hip-swaying rhythm was the driving force, and when paired with the infectious yet simple chorus (\"Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me\") it had listeners hooked, soaring to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Furtado \ntold BBC\n that \"Say it Right\" was one of the songs she had no idea would become a hit: \"The thing that still perplexes me about the song is that I still can't put into words what it's about,\" she said. \"I think it's maybe about personal, visceral abandon. Throwing yourself into something without inhibitions.\" She cited the Eurythmics as an inspiration for the song, explaining that she and Timbaland listened to the group a lot while creating \nLoose\n. \n \n In 2020, Tame Impala \ncovered the track\n and two years later, Gen Z \ndiscovered \nLoose\n, leading to the song's resurgence on TikTok. \"Say it Right\" went viral as the result of user \n@jamie32bsh\n dancing and singing along to the hit (Furtado even re-shared the clip in \na charming TikTok of her own\n). — \nNH\n'Give it to Me' (2007)\nAfter the mega-successes of Justin Timberlake's \nFutureSex/LoveSounds \nand Furtado's \nLoose\n, Timbaland (who produced both albums) reunited with the pop stars for \"Give it to Me,\" the lead single off his sophomore solo album, \nShock Value\n. It would go on to become Timbaland's only No. 1 hit with him as the lead artist, but it came with quite a lot of controversy. Described by Furtado as \"\nthe first-ever pop diss song\n,\" the club-pop anthem seemingly addressed multiple beefs at once, inspiring lots of fan theories as to who the song was aimed at. \nTimbaland's lyrics (\"I'm a real producer and you just the piano man\") were a jab at fellow producer Scott Storch, who had accused Timbaland of not giving him credit as a co-producer on Timberlake's hit \"Cry Me a River.\" Timberlake's verse (\"We missed you on the charts last week — damn, that's right, you wasn't there\") is slightly more vague, though many assumed it was about Prince, \nwho reportedly said the following at an Emmy Awards afterparty\n: \"For whoever is claiming that they are bringing sexy back, sexy never left!\" Furtado was left mostly unscathed, with some suggesting that she was feuding with fellow pop star Fergie, who allegedly modelled her solo album after Furtado's sound. \nThose rumours were quickly dismissed\n. While Furtado has admitted that she regrets releasing this song, noting that \"\nwe put a lot of negative energy out into the world\n,\" \"Give it to Me\" still acted as a chart-topping victory lap for three of music's biggest stars at the time. When you're at the top of your game, why wouldn't you want to boast a little? \n— ML\n'Keep Going Up' (2023)\n\"How you been, young lady? Does the feeling still drive you crazy?\" Timbaland asks off the top, immediately dropping a callback before a softened but \"Promiscuous\"-inspired beat drops. Marking the studio reunion of Furtado, Timbaland and Timberlake after 16 years, \"Keep Going Up\" is an optimistic, upbeat number that has its singers looking back over some hard years. \"I been workin' on my gains lately/ I been lovin' myself on the daily/ had to cut some people off, they were drainin'/ I'm no longer settlin', I'm upgradin',\" Furtado sings on her first verse, as she and Timberlake share the vocal spotlight with supportive nudges from Timbaland. \"It felt like the moment when we did 'Say it Right,\" Timbaland said in the \nmaking-of video for the new track\n. \"It's almost like we can read each other's minds, and there's a lot of trust there,\" Furtado added. We hope it's just the beginning of a new collaborative chapter for both of them.  \n— HG", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The film was funny, perceptive and announced Sennott as a star in the making.\nWith her second feature,\n \nSeligman is reaching for more than just observational comedy. Inspired by movies such as the satirical and silly \nWet Hot American Summer, \nthe world of \nBottoms \nis skewed and unhinged. The students of Rock Ridge worship Jeff (Nicholas Galitzine), the all-American football captain, with an almost religious intensity. Half-naked posters of him adorn the walls of the high school. So when PJ and Josie bump Jeff with their car in an attempt to protect one of their crushes, the principal summons them to class on the PA with a terse \"Could the ugly, untalented gays please report to the principal's office?\" \nAn attempt to explain their actions leads to the idea of a self-defence class for girls. With the attacks from a rival school on the rise, the principal gives his weary approval.\nVideo\nShiva Baby a 'clear, confident and funny' film from Canadian Emma Seligman\nQueeries\nBooksmart is the raunchy queer teen comedy we've been waiting for\nWhile Josie is naturally hesitant, PJ sees the fight club as a brilliant ploy to meet new girls. Rather than cheerleaders and hotties, the first wave of attendees is a cornucopia of oddballs and outsiders. Stella-Rebecca, a part-time model looking to protect herself from a stalker. Annie, an isolated Black Republican. Then there's Sylvie who is looking to beat up her stepdad, driven to the edge by his insistence on… Friday movie nights.  \nWith a David Fincher-like zealousness, soon the girls are pummelling each other with abandon. And as with the comedy, \nBottoms \nfully commits, if not revels, in the violence. Of course, such a club couldn't go unsupervised. \nEnter \nBottoms\n' MVP, former NFLer Marshawn Lynch as the social studies teacher Mr. G. Much more than stunt casting, Lynch's drawling delivery and lackadaisical attitude is infectious, whether he's spouting off about his divorce or his own twisted take on feminism. \nFar from precious, \nBottoms'\n very millennial, and shockingly cynical view of feminism and politics is part of what sets it apart. And yet, for all of PJ's scheming, the club soon beings to work, giving weirdos a sense of belonging and our two heroes a chance of getting in their dream girls' pants. \nBut for all its archaic energy, \nBottoms\n succumbs to the classic rom-com formula a little too neatly; the inevitable attraction, followed by the equally inevitable reveal of a secret that could tear them asunder. Still, these are minor peccadillos. What makes \nBottoms \nsing and worth seeing are the performances, the whip-smart writing and a fearlessness in what it finds funny. Long may it reign until the next high school contender comes along.\nEdebiri, Seligman, centre, and Sennott on set. Sennott starred in Seligman's previous film Shiva Baby.

He was 76.\n\"Jimmy passed away peacefully on the night of September 1st surrounded by his family, friends, music and dogs,\" a statement posted to Buffett's official website and social media pages said late Friday.\n\"He lived his life like a song till the very last breath and will be missed beyond measure by so many.\"\nThe statement did not say where Buffett died or give a cause of death. Illness had forced him to reschedule concerts in May and Buffett acknowledged in social media posts that he had been hospitalized, but provided no specifics.\nMargaritaville\n, released on Feb. 14, 1977, quickly took on a life of its own, becoming a state of mind for those \"wastin' away,\" an excuse for a life of low-key fun and escapism for those \"growing older, but not up.\"\nThe song is the unhurried portrait of a loafer on his front porch, watching tourists sunbathe while a pot of shrimp is beginning to boil. The singer has a new tattoo, a likely hangover and regrets over a lost love. Somewhere there is a misplaced salt shaker.\n\"What seems like a simple ditty about getting blotto and mending a broken heart turns out to be a profound meditation on the often painful inertia of beach dwelling,\" \nSpin\n magazine wrote in 2021.\n\"The tourists come and go, one group indistinguishable from the other. Waves crest and break whether somebody is there to witness it or not. Everything that means anything has already happened and you're not even sure when.\"\nThe song — from the album \nChanges in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\n \n—\n spent 22 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and peaked at No. 8. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2016 for its cultural and historic significance, became a karaoke standard and helped brand Key West, Fla., as a distinct sound of music and a destination known the world over.\n\"There was no such place as Margaritaville,\" Buffett told the Arizona Republic in 2021.\n\"It was a made-up place in my mind, basically made up about my experiences in Key West and having to leave Key West and go on the road to work and then come back and spend time by the beach.\"\nMusic critics were never very kind to Buffett or his catalogue, including the sandy beach-side snack bar songs like \nFins\n, \nCome Monday\n and \nCheeseburgers in Paradise\n.\nBut his legions of fans, called \"Parrotheads,\" regularly turned up for his concerts wearing toy parrots, cheeseburgers, sharks and flamingos on their heads, leis around their necks and loud Hawaiian shirts.\n\"It's pure escapism is all it is,\" he told the Republic.\n\"I'm not the first one to do it, nor shall I probably be the last. But I think it's really a part of the human condition that you've got to have some fun. You've got to get away from whatever you do to make a living or other parts of life that stress you out. I try to make it at least 50/50 fun to work and so far it's worked out.\"\nThe Buffett brand\nHis special Gulf Coast mix of country, pop, folk and rock added instruments and tonalities more commonly found in the Caribbean, like steel drums. It was a stew of steelpans, trombones and pedal steel guitar. Buffett's incredible ear for hooks and light grooves were often overshadowed by his lyrics about fish tacos and sunsets.\nA poet of paradise, Jimmy Buffett was an American music icon who inspired generations to step back and find the joy in life and in one another.<br><br>We had the honor to meet and get to know Jimmy over the years, and he was in life as he was performing on stage – full of goodwill and…\n&mdash;\n@POTUS\nThe song inspired restaurants and resorts, turning Buffett's alleged desire for the simplicity of island life into a multimillion-dollar brand. He landed at No. 13 in Forbes' America's Richest Celebrities in 2016 with a net worth of $550 million US.\nBuffett's evolving brand began in 1985 with the opening of a string of Margaritaville-themed stores and restaurants in Key West, followed in 1987 with the first Margaritaville Café nearby.\nThere also was a Broadway-bound jukebox musical, \nEscape to Margaritaville\n, a romantic comedy in which a singer-bartender called Tully falls for the far more career-minded Rachel, who is vacationing with friends and hanging out at Margaritaville, the hotel bar where Tully works.\nPromotional studio portrait of American singer and songwriter Jimmy Buffett, circa 1983.\n \n(MCA Records/Getty Images)\nJames William Buffett was born on Christmas day 1946 in Pascagoula, Miss., and raised in the port town of Mobile, Ala.\nHe graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Miss., and went from busking the streets of New Orleans to playing six nights a week at Bourbon Street clubs. He released his first record, \nDown To Earth\n, in 1970 and issued seven more on a regular yearly clip, with his 1974 song \nCome Monday\n from his fourth studio album \nLiving and Dying in ¾ Time\n, peaking at No. 30.\nThen came \nMargaritaville\n.\nHe performed on more than 50 studio and live albums, often accompanied by his Coral Reefer Band, and was constantly on tour. He earned two Grammy Award nominations, two Academy of Country Music Awards and a Country Music Association Award.\nFlying under the radar in Canada\n\"Canada holds a special place in my heart,\" Buffet told The Canadian Press in a 2004 interview. \"I've got more family in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia than I do in the States.\"\nWhen he came to the East Coast, visiting family and fishing topped his list of preferred activities.\nHe also spoke of his fondness for Canadian songwriters, saying he kept \"a keen ear to the north,\" favouring the likes of Gordon Lightfoot and Lennie Gallant, among others. He performed several songs penned by Canadian legend Bruce Cockburn, with two of those tracks — \nAnything Anytime Anywhere\n and \nSomeone I Used to Love\n — appearing on his 2004 album \nLicense to Chill\n.\nCanadian comedian Mark Critch said Buffett frequently visited Newfoundland to research his family's history. He recalled \"a very long time ago\" running into Buffett at a bar in St. John's called The Republic.\n\"A guy was sitting at the end of the bar who had flown in and was researching his family history,\" Critch recalled in an interview. \"And he walks out and then somebody says, 'I think that was Jimmy Buffett.\"'\nHow Lennie Gallant almost brushed off Jimmy Buffett's request to write songs together\nBuffett would make a point to travel to the province's far-flung rural communities, stumbling upon his grandfather's home community of Rose Blanche.\n\"When he found out where his ancestry is from, it connected and made sense to him,\" Critch said. \"I guess we're pretty laid back. We like to drink, we like the ocean. Those are very Jimmy Buffett things.\"\nBuffett could fly under the radar in Newfoundland, enjoying a sort of quiet anonymity away from the keen eye of \"Parrotheads.\" He would sometimes take the stage at local bars and perform lengthy songs like Gordon Lightfoot's \nCanadian Railroad Trilogy\n.\nCritch said you'd never know Buffett was a famous musician unless you directly asked him.\n\"People respected that his family had come from here,\" he said. \"They'd respectfully give him his space, but a warm Newfoundland welcome.\"\nBuffett made multiple appearances on a local radio show hosted by Critch's brother Mike Campbell on 97.5 KROCK, and had performed at a local high school. Buffett had been planning to come back to the East Coast to promote his upcoming album, Campbell said.\nBuffett is survived by his wife, Jane, along with daughters Savannah and Sarah and son Cameron.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Olmedo handed down the sentence to Masterson, 47, after hearing statements from the women about the trauma they experienced and the suffering caused by the disturbing memories in the years since.\nThe actor, who has been in custody since May, sat in court wearing a suit. He watched the women without visible reaction as they spoke.\n\"When you raped me, you stole from me,\" said one woman who Masterson was convicted of raping in 2003. \"That's what rape is, a theft of the spirit.\n\"You are pathetic, disturbed and completely violent,\" she said. \"The world is better off with you in prison.\"\nThe other woman Masterson was found guilty of raping said he \"has not shown an ounce of remorse for the pain he caused.\" She told the judge, \"I knew he belonged behind bars for the safety of all the women he came into contact with. I am so sorry, and I'm so upset. I wish I'd reported him sooner to the police.\"\nDanny Masterson found guilty of 2 counts of rape in retrial\nJury deadlocked, mistrial declared in Danny Masterson rape trial\nAfter an initial jury failed to reach verdicts on three counts of rape in December and a mistrial was declared, prosecutors retried Masterson on all three counts earlier this year.\nA jury of seven women and five men found Masterson guilty of two counts on May 31 after seven days of deliberations.\nMasterson waived his right to speak before he was sentenced and had no visible reaction after the judge's decision, nor did the many family members sitting beside him. His wife, actor Bijou Phillips, was tearful earlier in the hearing.\nDanny Masterson and his wife Bijou Phillips arrive for closing arguments in his second trial on May 16.  \n \n(Chris Pizzello/The Associated Press)\nBoth attacks took place in Masterson's Hollywood-area home in 2003, when he was at the height of his fame on the Fox network sitcom \nThat '70s Show\n. \nThe jury could not reach a unanimous verdict on a third count, an allegation that Masterson also raped a longtime girlfriend.\n'Mr. Masterson, you are not the victim here'\nThe judge sentenced the actor after rejecting a defence motion for a new trial that was argued earlier Thursday.\nThe sentence was the maximum allowed by law. It means Masterson will be eligible for parole after serving 25 1/2 years, but can be held in prison for life.\n\"Mr. Masterson, I know that you're sitting here steadfast in your claims of innocence, and thus no doubt feeling victimized by a justice system that has failed you,\" Olmedo told Masterson before handing down the sentence.\n\"But Mr. Masterson, you are not the victim here. Your actions 20 years ago took away another person's voice, and choice. One way or another you will have to come to terms with your prior actions, and their consequences.\"\nThe defence sought to have sentences for the two convictions run simultaneously, and asked for a sentence of 15 years to life. The prosecution asked for the full 30 years to life sentence Masterson was eligible for.\n\"It's his life that will be impacted by what you decide today,\" Masterson's lawyer Shawn Holley told the judge before the sentencing. \"And the life of his nine-year-old daughter, who means the world to him, and to whom he means the world.\"\n\"He has lived an exemplary life, he has been an extraordinary father, husband, brother, son, co-worker and community servant,\" Holley said.\nChurch of Scientology denies telling women not to report assaults\nProsecutors alleged that Masterson used his prominence in the Church of Scientology — where all three women were also members at the time — to avoid consequences for decades after the attacks.\nThe women blamed the church for their hesitancy in going to police about Masterson. They testified that when they reported him to Scientology officials, they were told they were not raped, were put through ethics programs themselves, and were warned against going to law enforcement to report a member of such high standing.\nThe church said in a statement after the verdict that the \"testimony and descriptions of Scientology beliefs\" during the trial were \"uniformly false.\"\n\"The Church has no policy prohibiting or discouraging members from reporting criminal conduct of anyone — Scientologists or not — to law enforcement,\" the statement said.\nThe Church of Scientology of Los Angeles. Prosecutors alleged Masterson used his prominence in the church to avoid consequences for decades after the attacks.\n \n(Chris Pizzello/The Associated Press)\nMasterson did not testify, and his lawyers called no witnesses. The defence argued that the acts were consensual, and attempted to discredit the women's stories by highlighting changes and inconsistencies over time, which they said showed signs of coordination between them.\nThe women whose testimony led to Masterson's conviction said that in 2003, he gave them drinks and that they then became woozy or passed out before he violently raped them.\nOlmedo allowed prosecutors and accusers to say directly in the second trial that Masterson drugged the women, while only allowing the women to describe their condition in the first.\nMasterson was not charged with any counts of drugging, and there was no toxicology evidence to back up the assertion. The issue could be a factor in a planned appeal from the defence of Masterson's conviction.\nThe Associated Press does not typically name people who say they've been sexually abused.\nIn this undated publicity photo released by Fox TV, the cast of That '70s Show celebrates the series' 200th and final episode. From the left, Masterson, Debra Jo Rupp, Ashton Kutcher, Tommy Chong, Kurtwood Smith, Wilmer Valderrama and Don Stark. \n \n(Greg Gayne/Fox Broadcasting/The Associated Press)\nMasterson starred with Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Topher Grace in \nThat '70s Show\n from 1998 until 2006.\nHe had reunited with Kutcher on the 2016 Netflix comedy \nThe Ranch\n, but was written off the show when a Los Angeles Police Department investigation was revealed the following year.\nWhile that investigation began before a wave of women shook Hollywood with stories about Harvey Weinstein in October 2017, the conviction and sentencing of Masterson still represents a major #MeToo era success for Los Angeles prosecutors, along with the conviction of Weinstein himself last year.\nSupport is available for anyone who has been sexually assaulted.

In fact, even some gamers might not have heard of it.\nBut the online multiplayer action game made by Digital Extremes, headquartered in London, Ont., has been soldiering along for 10 years now, buoyed by a dedicated fan base from around the world.\n\"It's not mainstream, even though it's older and it's outlived many games that have had way more buzz,\" said creative director Rebecca Ford. \"I think it's due to our [aversion] to the spotlight that we continue to live in this little cohort of the gaming industry.\"\nWarframe\n's sustained popularity is a rarity in an industry where many online games can fizzle within a year or less. It's rarer still for a mid-sized company based somewhere in Canada other than Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal, where most large gaming studios have set up shop.\nRoughly 2,000 fans packed the RBC Place in downtown London last week for TennoCon, the game's annual fan convention — this one marking its 10th anniversary. It's the first in-person TennoCon in three years, after going virtual in 2020 because of the pandemic.\nThe event — and the fan base themselves — is named after the Tenno, the heavily armed and mobile warriors that players control in \nWarframe\n.

He credits his continued interest in the game to the welcoming community of players and developers.\n\"If you're a new player, it wouldn't be that uncommon for someone to just give you something that would actually cost the premium currency because they're like, 'Hey, glad to have you here,'\" said Petersons, who claims to have logged over 3,000 hours in the game.\nLocal London talent\nDigital Extremes was founded in 1993. Its early claim to fame was co-creating titles like \nEpic Pinball\n and \nUnreal Tournament\n with U.S.-based \nEpic Games\n, the makers of \nFortnite\n.\nFord, an Ontario native and graduate of Western University in London, estimates that about half of the studio's approximately 500 employees are based in London; the rest work remotely out of the U.S. and further abroad.\n\"We have a lot of local talent.

At TennoCon they debuted new preview footage of \nSoulframe\n, a fantasy game counterpart to \nWarframe\n. And it's set to publish \nWayfinder\n, a new online multiplayer game they've created in partnership with Texas-based studio Airship Syndicate.\nStrong community bonds\nCommunity director Megan Everett was born in London and studied marketing at Fanshawe College in the same city. She didn't know the Digital Extremes studio existed until she met Ford about 10 years ago; she's been working there ever since.\n\"I think I was of that classic mindset of like, you can't make money playing video games.

LaChance thinks the move to community and family living over the last 40 years has also led to longer and happier lives. \nHere I Am\nLaChance, whose 30-year-old son Kevin has Down syndrome, says that good news wasn't reflected in the images she saw of people today.\n\"I think there still are some stereotypes to be broken, some myths and misconceptions to be busted about the ability and even the presence of individuals with intellectual disabilities as they age in the community.\"\nN.S. photo project celebrates people living with Down syndrome\n3 days ago\nDuration \n3:21\nPeople with Down syndrome are living longer than ever and a new photo project in Nova Scotia is celebrating that. It aims to upend stereotypes and share the good news. Jon Tattrie has the story.\nLaChance says she had the idea to work with photographer Hilary Gauld to showcase the lives lived by people with Down syndrome. \n\"I just felt there was a huge gap and a huge need to photograph people with Down syndrome in great light and in great environments and doing the things they do,\" Gauld told CBC News.\nHowever, budget limits kept the \nHere I Am\n cameras in central Canada. CBC decided to visit some Nova Scotians with Down syndrome to add to the images. \nHitting his stride\nAdam Bauld works on his latest painting in his Halifax home. \n \n(Robert Short/CBC)\nAdam Bauld recently celebrated his 40th birthday in Halifax. He enjoys spending time with his parents and two brothers. He plays sports, including at the Special Olympics. \nHe works at Clearwater Seafoods in customer service and enhanced cleaning. \n\"I started in February 2005. And these are my long service awards — 10 years of service in 2015, 15 years of service 2020, during the COVID pandemic. And I also got a congratulation pack for service,\" he says, showing his awards. \nFor the last decade, art has been a major passion. His paintings decorate his room. \n\"These paintings over here are like collage, a camp, abstract, a religious painting over there about Calvary and the Cross of Christ,\" he says during a tour of his work.\nHe says some of his friends have Down syndrome and some don't. \"My experience is that God created every person in His image, whether it's Down syndrome or not Down syndrome,\" he says. \nIt's a message shared by many people at \nL'Arche Homefires, a community of people with intellectual disabilities living in five houses in Wolfville, N.S\n. People here have friends without Down syndrome and friends with Down syndrome. \nCameron Cook weaves scarves, place mats and bags in his favourite colours. He also volunteers at the local fire department. \nCameron Cook works on his loom at L'Arche Homefires in Wolfville. \n \n(Robert Short/CBC)\nBrittany Bennett is working on a new scarf.

He has a bright message, too. \"Enjoy yourself. Be happy,\" he says with a broad smile. \nGregory Moore enjoys theatre and weaving with bright colours. \n \n(Robert Short/CBC)\nThe two founding members of L'Arche Homefires — \nKeith Strong and John MacNeil\n — both had Down syndrome. \nAssistant Robert Rose \nsupported Strong, who died in 2018, during his last years\n, and now spends his days with MacNeil.\nJohn MacNeil and Keith Strong shake hands as Ingrid Blais looks on. \n \n(Submitted by L'Arche Homefires)\n\"They've been real teachers for us because we've had to learn with them as they've gotten older. And we have had to make changes around their changing health conditions,\" Rose says. \n\"We try to create a safe, stable, and peaceful environment. A small support team is created to work with the core member so that there is staff consistency throughout the week. We have found that this greatly reduces the core member's anxiety.\"\nOlder people with Down syndrome often have to deal with Alzheimer's disease and \"accelerated aging,\" meaning some will see physical, medical and cognitive signs of aging much earlier than what is expected for their age.\n\"This has been a learning process for everyone involved. The assistants have had to let go of their expectations and agendas and meet core members where they are,\" Rose says. \"As the elders in our community, our core members continue to teach us even when they are non-verbal.\"\nRobert Rose says he's learned a lot about life from working with older people with Down syndrome. \n \n(Robert Short/CBC)\nMacNeil used to live in a busy part of his home, but moving to a quieter area proved more comfortable in his golden years. Now he sets the agenda for the day. \n\"That was a game-changer with John,\" Rose says. \"He was in a space where he felt safe. His behaviour, his anxiety decreased significantly. Now he's in a place where people can visit him whenever he wants but he's not near the flow of traffic in the house anymore.\"\nRose said it's the first job he's ever had where he felt he could be completely himself — a lesson he learned from Strong and MacNeil.\n\"I think one of the things we've all realized is how important the elders are in our community. Even though they may be physically limited as they get older, their presence is palpable,\" he says. \"The real value is not so much what people are doing, it's their being — it's who they are. And that's what I've seen come through as our core members have gotten older.\"\nThe Here I Am project started with 13 images and grew. The Canadian Down Syndrome Society hopes to keep growing it and add it to photo databases so that journalists have a broader range of images to illustrate stories about people with Down syndrome.\nThe group also hopes to include people from a diverse range of backgrounds. In Canada, about 50,000 people have Down syndrome, and the project aims to capture as many of those faces as it can. \nLaChance says it reminds all of us that people with Down syndrome have always been part of humanity. She cites\n research that may show some of this largely hidden history\n. \n\"Much of our history is learned from stained-glass windows or scribe accounts. And there was always a court jester; many of these images show the facial features of an individual with Down syndrome,\" she says. \n\"Individuals with Down syndrome have been around forever and brought joy and happiness to the communities they lived in when they could.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES \nThere's 'misunderstanding' around treaties, and a Mi'kmaw academic aims to change that\nMushrooms thriving in Nova Scotia's wet summer, say foragers\nJapanese beetles continue to munch their way through Halifax trees and plants\nHalifax will soon decide how to create affordable housing in Cogswell District\nMissing boater in Tidnish, N.S., found dead", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Like this was almost a destiny kind of feeling?\nYou know, I never get that. I don't know why, but I feel like I have a mission, and I'm getting it done. That's more how I feel about it.\n \nWere you feeling like you were handling the events and the work in an intentional, healthy way at the time?\nDefinitely not. I was a wild boy, I was wilin' all the time, partying. But I got the party out of me early on and young. So that's all I was doing, just the most. But I don't regret it. You know, I made a lot of great music off of that, and it's helped me look back and be like, OK, well, I had fun. Now I'm ready to do different stuff, grow up, kind of do adult stuff that I enjoy.\nWhen I always think about the act of creating, writing, making the art while under the influence of, like you said, [Hennessy] all day, what did that bring out of you? What would you say the artistic expression was under the influence?\nIt was super rock-star vibes, just living free, carefree. [I did] not care about even myself, really. It was just constant partying. No sleep for weeks, just partying, making music\n.\n \nI made a lot of great music off of that, and it's helped me look back and be like, OK, well, I had fun. Now I'm ready to do different stuff, grow up.\n- Roy Woods\nI also read somewhere that earlier in your career that you were writing from a place of needing love. What kind of love are we talking about? There's all sorts of different love in life. There is the romantic love that often shows up in a lot of music, but there's familial love, there's brotherly love, you know, all these different kinds of love that can come your way, love from God. What kind of love were you in need of? \nAt first, I thought it was more romantic love. That's what I was talking about. Over the years, I realized the love I need is nothing close to that, it's not even in that area. That was just the young me. Now the older me is like, \"OK, well, I have to go back and kind of deal with some traumas,\" which I have been doing. Now I realize the love that I needed was family. But I didn't know that, being young. You just want to replace what you don't have with something else that may be just as good, right? And that's all I was doing, not realizing, \"Oh, wait, I'm destroying myself in the process of that.\"\nSo the new album is out. What does \nMixed Emotions\n mean to you?\nFirst of all, when you take away every other letter except for the first two from \nMixed Emotions\n, you get \"me.\" That's what I'm giving everybody, versions of me that are complete. I feel like the earlier versions of me that people know me for, you know, the \nExis\n, the \nWaking at Dawn\n — [projects that are] very incomplete. I'm writing from a place unknowing. It wasn't controlled, what I was writing about. \nWild Black's optimistic self-love anthem, and 6 more songs you need to hear this week\nI [was] just winging it, you know? Literally just winging songs. For instance, I wouldn't talk about one girl on one song. I'd have to go to two, maybe three girls, and take different experiences from them and then make a song. So everybody thinks like I'm talking about one girl. Nah, it's just the situation.\nNow, person and the artist that I am, I can talk about one situation. Even if it made me feel great, even if it made me feel small just a little bit, I can write about it now. I didn't have the power to do that before, the control to do that before. So that's what this album is — showing a lot of controlled creativity from where I want to give my feelings, give my places of thoughts, opinions on myself, relationships, other people in my family, the past, the future, everything. It was so much more controlled than it ever was. That's why I feel like I'm so much more proud of this body of work, because it's everything I actually wanted to say, not things that I was trying to say.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length\n. \nTo hear the full interview, listen to \nThe Block\n on CBC Music.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

I hope the first week of school was smooth. We are looking forward to some beautiful weather and some crisp fall weather. I absolutely love autumn and the array of orchard fruits and activities during these months.\nI also absolutely love back-to-school stories shared online and pictures of kids being sent off to school. With three of mine in university, I have been relishing my youngest still being in high school. I only have one more year of packing lunches and coordinating schedules. \nBut this year amongst all the excitement, \nfinancials are top of mind\n. I think about being able to support and encourage the kids as prices skyrocket for everything from school supplies to food. There have been some amazing initiatives from across the country of communities \nexchanging and donating items\n to other families. The reminder that when we're vulnerable we can rely on each other is truly wonderful.\nSomething else that brought me a lot of joy was the publication day of my friend Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir. She wrote a book called \nLion on the Inside: How One Girl Changed Basketball\n.\nAbdul-Qaadir lived in London, Ont., \nfor a short while\n but now lives in Memphis, Tenn., with her husband and two sons. She has been part of basketball history for pushing FIBA to allow women with hijab to play basketball at professional levels. Not only is the book highly anticipated, her parents' unboxing video is possibly the cutest thing ever. \nParents celebrating the accomplishments of their children is a cool thing and I am all here for it. \nAnother thing that deserves celebration is an incredible story of a bird that was once thought to be extinct, making a bold return to New Zealand. \nTakahē birds\n were thought to be completely gone in 1898 but \nconservationists\n had been working with the few that were rediscovered in 1948 and slowly the population grew. \nThere are now approximately 500 of these flightless birds who live in the mountains. The birds were respected and valued by Indigenous tribes (particularly the Ngāi Tahu) who would weave their feathers into cloaks. \nThis has been declared a success by experts and community members who are mobilizing on protecting endangered bird species in New Zealand including the kiwi, the country's national bird. \nI love this story and among all the devastation to the environment, wildfires and horrible recent events that have left us feeling helpless and sad, it's very beautiful to find a sliver of hope. Especially when it's in the shape of a prehistoric blue bird with a bright red beak!\nI wasn't a massive fan of the Barbie movie, but I am VERY excited about the latest collection of the Mattel dolls. The 2023 Career of the Year is Women in Sports Barbies. I love the racial diversity of this roster and would be happy to have them join my collection alongside Billie Jean King and my Sarah Nurse dolls.\nMaybe one day they'll add to this collection with a sports journalist / sport media instructor Barbie who wears a hijab.

RJ Barrett managed just two points and zero made field goals in a first half that also featured clanked three-point attempts and foul trouble for the starting frontcourt of Kelly Olynyk and Dwight Powell.\nYet Canada still emerged with the lead, thanks in large part to Olynyk, the Canadian captain playing in his first World Cup since 2010.\nOlynyk makes early impact \nOlynyk's aggressiveness in defending star French centre Rudy Gobert led to an unsportsmanlike foul — two free throws and the ball for Canada — and proved a key turning point at a juncture when Canada trailed by four in the second quarter.\nThat type of grittiness — the FIBA-style toughness that went missing for long stretches in heartbreaking losses to Venezuela in 2015, France in 2016 and the Czech Republic in 2021 —appeared to carry the day.\n\"If you keep pushing the wall, pushing the wall, eventually you're going to break through and I think that's what our goal is right now. This is our time to break through and we need to do it as a team together,\" Olynyk said at a Thursday press conference.\n\"There's not one person on this team that's going to do it by themselves. But that's our goal, [the] collective goal is to, when we leave the World Cup, we know we're dialed in and we're preparing everything for Paris next summer.\"\nFrance's Guerschon Yabusele, right, battles for the ball against Olynyk, left, and Gilgeous-Alexander, centre.\n \n(Dita Alangkara/The Associated Press)\nThe Kamloops, B.C., native led the team with 12 points in the first half and finished with 18.\nHis contributions opened the door for Gilgeous-Alexander and Canada to be the best versions of themselves in the second half, a 52-25 drubbing of France.\nHead coach Jordi Fernandez, who took over the role from Nick Nurse in June, said Canada accomplished its goal of playing hard.\n\"The guys showed resiliency. We didn't start very well. We took good shots that didn't go in. We stayed with it and then in the second half, our pressure, physicality [increased] and then shots started to fall,\" he said.\nVictory crucial in path to quarterfinals\nCanada is now in the driver's seat of a tournament that can feel late early if you let it. Beating France, the top-ranked team in Group H, is not only important for getting out of the group stage, but also a vital step toward reach the quarterfinals.\nThere, the top two teams from Group H will merge with the top two teams from Group G, which will likely include reigning champion Spain. Records carry over, and the two teams atop the standings in the new group advance to the quarterfinals.\nEssentially, only two of Canada, France and Spain can move on to the quarterfinals in Manila, Philippines. Which is why banking Friday's victory over France was especially crucial.\n\"We're showing our identity and what we're built for. And it's not just this summer, it's gonna be moving forward, how our program is gonna grow. And our goal is not just to qualify for the Olympics or fight for a gold medal, but it's also in the next 10 years how good we can be as a program,\" Fernandez said.\nWATCH | Ex-coach Triano confident in 2023 Team Canada:\n'I'm confident they'll do well at FIBA World Cup': Former Canadian men's basketball coach Jay Triano\n18 days ago\nDuration \n1:11\nFormer Canadian men's basketball coach Jay Triano expresses his thoughts on the Canadian Men's basketball team.

Heading into the second round, it's fair to wonder whether the team should set its sights even higher.\n \n Led by the marvelous Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and new coach Jordi Fernandez, Canada rolled through its first-round group in Jakarta, Indonesia with three blowout wins. A stunning 95-65 rout of 2021 Olympic silver medallist France led to a 128-72 laugher against Lebanon before the Canadians overcame a slow start to surge past Latvia 101-75 to \nclaim first place in Group H\n.\n \n For the 16-team second round, tipping off Friday, Canada joins a new group with Spain (3-0), Brazil (2-1) and Latvia (2-1). Those records carry over, and each team plays the two group members that it didn't face in the opening round. Canada will meet Brazil on Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET and Spain on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. ET. The top two teams in each group advance to the quarterfinals in the Philippines.\n \n The competition will get tougher now that the field has been cut in half. But the Canadians appear equipped to meet the moment. Their point differential of plus-111 topped all 32 teams in the opening round, including the tournament-favourite United States (plus-103).\n \n Canada's NBA-seasoned roster features a truly elite player in Gilgeous-Alexander, the 25-year-old guard for the Oklahoma City Thunder who placed fifth in NBA MVP voting last season. SGA scored 27 points and dished out six assists against both France and Latvia while averaging 9.5 rebounds in those games. He's the second-leading scorer among players still in contention for the title — trailing only Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic (30.0 points), who played significantly more minutes than SGA in leading Slovenia to a 3-0 record.\nWATCH | Canada improves to 3-0 at FIBA World Cup:\n \nCanada defeats Latvia to win FIBA World Cup group for 1st time\n10 days ago\nDuration \n2:26\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 27 points and RJ Barrett added 22 points, as Canada used a strong second-half surge to beat Latvia 101-75 and finish atop Group H at the FIBA World Cup with a perfect 3-0 record.\nGilgeous-Alexander's supporting cast — a concern heading into the tournament after fellow NBA stars Jamal Murray and Andrew Wiggins dropped out — has been solid too. Veteran big man Kelly Olynyk is averaging 15 points, while streaky youngster RJ Barrett bounced back from a 1-for-10 shooting night against France to average nearly 20 points in the next two games. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (SGA's cousin) is averaging close to 13 points, and mercurial forward Dillon Brooks has brought toughness and physicality despite his limited offensive production.\n \n Those guys are among the seven Canadian players who are currently on an NBA roster, along with big man Dwight Powell (seven points per game) and guard Lu Dort, an energetic defensive ace who sat out the last two games due to unspecified soreness but is expected to return. Canada also has the reigning NCAA player of the year in Zach Edey. The 7-foot-4 centre has played just 19 minutes so far, but he's scored 14 points on 7-for-7 shooting and \ncould become a bigger factor\n as the tournament progresses.\n \n Add it all up and Canada looks like a good bet to claim its first Olympic men's basketball berth since 2000, when a young Steve Nash carried his team to the quarterfinals in Sydney.\nWATCH | Canada's Olympic basketball run in 2000 left Nash in tears:\n \nCanada's Olympic basketball run in 2000 left Steve Nash in tears\n2 years ago\nDuration \n6:07\nAt the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the Canadian men's basketball team was coming off the biggest win in its history. But standing in the way of a shot at medals was Team France.\nIn order to secure the Olympic appearance here, Canada must finish among the top two teams from the Americas region. The other remaining contenders for those spots are the U.S. (3-0), the Dominican Republic (3-0), Brazil (2-1) and Puerto Rico (2-1).\n \n Not to write off Brazil, but leading scorer Yago (yes, Brazilian basketball players do the one-name thing too) doesn't play in the NBA. Neither does No. 2 scorer Bruno Caboclo, the Raptors draft bust infamously described as being \"two years away from being two years away\" before eventually washing out of the NBA. In fact, Brazil doesn't have any NBA players on its roster, and neither does Puerto Rico. The Dominicans essentially have one: Karl-Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves, a three-time NBA all-star forward who's nonetheless viewed as an underachiever after being picked first overall in the 2015 draft. Two if you count Lester Quinones, who played four games for Golden State as an undrafted rookie last season but spent most of the year in the G League. \n \n Strange things can happen in international basketball, where talent doesn't seem to win out as reliably as it does in the NBA. But right now, Canada has to be considered the favourite to join the U.S. in clinching those two Olympic spots earmarked for the Americas. Oddsmakers seem to agree: while the Americans remain the distant betting favourites to win the World Cup, Canada is now the clear No. 2 — ahead of Olympic bronze medallist Australia, Spain, Serbia, Germany and Doncic's Slovenia.\nCanada's 7-foot-4 secret weapon, Zach Edey, is hiding in plain sight\nThe Aussies are loaded with NBA players, but none you'd consider a star. Spain's Gasol-fuelled golden age, which produced three straight Olympic medals from 2008-16, is in the rearview. Serbia is without Nikola Jokic, who's \nstill celebrating\n his Finals MVP.\n \n Germany's top scorer is journeyman Dennis Schroder, signed by the Raptors this summer. Olympic silver medallist France was eliminated in the first round, and nine of the 16 teams left in the tournament have never won a medal at the World Cup (including Canada). Even the U.S. is no Dream Team, with guys like Anthony Edwards, Jalen Brunson, Paolo Banchero and Austin Reaves sharing the scoring load in the absence of Steph Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and other more accomplished NBA stars.\n \n In other words, the time is right for Canada to not just grab that long-awaited Olympic berth, but maybe even make a run at the World Cup title too.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The 25-year-old Oklahoma City Thunder guard ranked fourth in NBA scoring last season with 31.4 points per game and placed fifth in MVP balloting — three spots ahead of Doncic. Though the Slovenian put up gaudier numbers (he also averaged 8.6 rebounds and 8.0 assists, compared to 4.8 and 5.5 for Gilgeous-Alexander), some critics viewed him as somewhat of a \nchucker\n, compiling empty stats for a disappointing Dallas team that failed to reach the post-season.\nWATCH | Canada books ticket to Paris Games with win over Spain:\nCanada earns Olympic berth with thrilling win over Spain at FIBA World Cup\n5 days ago\nDuration \n1:29\nThe red and white came away with an 88-85 nail-biting victory to advance to the quarterfinals, as well as clinch a spot in the 2024 summer Olympic Games in Paris.\nGilgeous-Alexander, on the other hand, dragged a written-off Thunder team to a play-in game with his superior efficiency, defensive play and unselfishness. Those traits have all been on display in the World Cup, where Gilgeous-Alexander (23.8 points per game) ranks second in scoring among players who reached the quarterfinals. He was incredible in the must-win against Spain, pouring in a game-high 30 points while going 14 for 16 on free throws, including a cold-blooded 6 for 6 in the final 21 seconds with the game in the balance. SGA might be the best player in this tournament.\nIf Gilgeous-Alexander and company can clear the Luka obstacle, they'll face Serbia in the semifinals on Friday. Despite missing the best player in the world as Nikola Jokic chills from his NBA Finals MVP run, the Serbs reached the final four with today's 87-68 win over Lithuania. Bogdan Bogdanovic, who averaged 14 points for the Atlanta Hawks last season, led the way today with 21 points and is averaging a team-high 18.8 in the World Cup.

It took some convincing, but eventually Edey agreed to hit the court as a form of cross-training and conditioning.\nHe was hooked after one practice.\n\"He came home and he was fired up,\" his mother, Julia, remembers. \"He said to me, 'That was really fun.' And I said, 'What did you guys do?' I was all excited for him. He said, 'We ran suicides.'

Despite his NCAA success, he's mostly projected as a second-round NBA pick due to concerns about his foot speed in a league now dominated by guards.\nTwo years ago, he was the final cut from Team Canada at the last-chance Olympic qualifier in Victoria. Meanwhile, Czech centre Ondrej Balvin dominated with 19 rebounds as Canada was upset on home court.\nWATCH | Triano confident Canada will 'do well' at World Cup:\n'I'm confident they'll do well at FIBA World Cup': Former Canadian men's basketball coach Jay Triano\n18 days ago\nDuration \n1:11\nFormer Canadian men's basketball coach Jay Triano expresses his thoughts on the Canadian Men's basketball team. He believes the team has the squad to go far at the FIBA World Cup and qualify for the Olympics.\n'You've got a talent here'\nEdey was first discovered within the basketball community by a 12 year old. On orders from his mom, Ethan Massiah approached Edey during a break in play and told him he must meet his uncle Vidal.\nVidal Massiah was the captain of the Canadian senior team in 2004 and 2005. He played NCAA and overseas, but never reached the NBA. After his playing career, Massiah decided he wanted to give back to his community by coaching and founded the Northern Kings Academy.\nMassiah sent a lengthy scouting report to Purdue head coach Matt Painter during college recruiting.\n \n(Submitted by Vidal Massiah)\nWhich is what led to Ethan grabbing Edey's phone number — really, Edey's mom's phone number — and relaying it to his mom Tanya, who sent it to Vidal.\n\"We're in the world of finding talent. And no one knew of Zach,\" Vidal Massiah said. \"So it was like, OK, well, we're probably not missing out on much. No one's heard of this kid. You're not quite sure how tall he is, but you know what, I'll call him and we'll see where it goes.\"\nBut Julia Edey didn't pick up the phone. She didn't even call back until a few months later, since Zach was still committed to baseball.\nEventually, Massiah and Julia Edey, a former high school player herself who stands at six-foot-three, crossed paths at one of Zach's games.\n\"He said, 'You've got a talent here,'\" Julia recalled. \"And I remember looking at him and saying, 'OK, but he's a baseball player, so that's interesting'. But he said, 'No, you've got like an NBA talent here.' … And I just said to Vi, I said it with [some] colourful language, but I said, 'You're scaring me. That's super cool. But you're scaring me.'\"\nFIBA potential\nZach Edey's NBA future remains to be seen — he could've entered this past June's draft, but instead chose to play out his final college season as a star with big NIL (name, image, and likeness) earning potential on a Purdue team that was upset as a No. 1 seed in March Madness.\nExperts agree that he should be a force in FIBA play, where physicality is increased and post play remains valued.\n\"I think this is a completely different animal where like this would be more traditional high-level decision making, positional, really using your advantage, whatever that may be. That game, FIBA basketball, it's more tactical in a way, right? So I think from that standpoint he's going to be a star,\" Massiah said.\nJust Edey's presence on the court in Victoria could've been the difference in that OT loss to the Czechs, perhaps even propelling Canada to the Tokyo Olympics.\nWith mom by his side, Canada's Zach Edey dominating college basketball\nInstead, days after being cut, he was already in Latvia to play at the U-19 World Cup. Edey helped Canada to a third-place finish after a close semifinal loss to the U.S., and he led the tournament with a whopping 14.1 rebounds per game.\n\"I think baseball sharpened his mind. His dad used to say to him, the only important play is the next one or the next pitch. Forget about what happened. Forget about whether or not you just struck someone out or you gave up a home run,\" Julia said.\nWATCH | Edey stars for Canada in World Cup qualifying win in 2022:\n7'4\" centre Zach Edey impresses in Canada's blowout win over U.S. Virgin Islands\n1 year ago\nDuration \n1:59\n20-year-old Zach Edey of Toronto scored 6 points in Canada's 113-67 victory over the U.S. Virgin Islands, as Canada finished the first round of FIBA World Cup qualifications with a perfect 6-0 record.\nHelped by multi-sport past\nMassiah also credited Zach's baseball and hockey history for his basketball temperament.\n\"He wasn't a basketball player, but he was an athlete. … And he had a competitive edge to him, like even when he couldn't contribute in a major way on both ends while on our team,\" he said.\n\"His voice, his presence, his level of engagement was all signs of this guy who's super competitive. If he lost the game, Zach was pissed. I mean, he was upset, you know? He would verbalize it. He would encourage his teammates to do better, to play harder.\"\nOn the court, Edey's skillset is also rooted in other sports. His graceful footwork may be a product of being a seven-footer on skates for so many years.

Then Gillease noticed a deal to pay an extra $500 US per person to travel in business class, which included lie-flat seats.\n\"The differential was not very large to get a much nicer experience,\" said Gillease, who works in marketing. \"We thought it's worth it to kick off the trip and get lie-flat seats and pay not much more money than what we would have paid to fly economy direct from San Francisco.\" \nThe family bought the tickets to help ensure they were well-rested upon landing in Paris, where they would be for only four hours before travelling on to Corsica, a Mediterranean island in France. Their itinerary also included stops in Denmark and Norway, before spending the final two weeks on an African safari. \nThe catch? They had to make a connection in Calgary and fly with WestJet.\nWhen Gillease chose to hub her international voyage through Calgary, she became part of a trend that has seen an increase in American travellers, mostly from the west coast, who are flying with WestJet to overseas destinations. \nA record number of Americans flew with WestJet to Europe this summer.\n \n(Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\nRecord figures\nThis summer, 86,000 passengers on international flights with WestJet began or ended their journey in the U.S., which is a record high for the airline.\nThe number of Americans on WestJet's transatlantic flights is up nearly 70 per cent compared to last summer, the airline said.\nAll of WestJet's flights to Asia and Europe are based out of Calgary. The airline operates year-round or seasonal flights to Tokyo as well as European cities like Edinburgh, London, Rome, Barcelona, Dublin and Paris.\nThere are a variety of reasons for the rise in U.S. passengers flying through Calgary, including an increase this year \nin the number of international flights\n by WestJet.\nThose extra seats come at a time of high demand, high prices and few available seats on many U.S. and European airlines on flights across the Atlantic Ocean, which has created an \"extremely strong\" air travel market, said John Grant, the chief data analyst at OAG, an aviation analytics firm.\n\"The continued \npost-pandemic 'revenge-spend' phenomena\n is in existence,\" said Grant, who is based in the United Kingdom. \"The strength of the U.S. dollar has encouraged more U.S. visitors to Europe.\"\nGrant added that people will often opt for a indirect flight because they think they can get a cheaper fare. \"And sometimes they can.\" \nWestJet has increased the number of overseas flights over the last decade.\n \n(Tiphanie Roquette/CBC)\nSoaring costs\nThe number of seats on flights between the U.S. and Europe is only three per cent lower this summer compared to 2019, said Hayley Berg, the Boston-based lead economist for Hopper, an airfare finder app.\nBut fares for those flights are up sharply as airlines cash in on consumer cravings for trips abroad. The average ticket price for a round-trip transatlantic flight in June was $1,054 US, a nearly 17 per cent increase compared to 2019, according to Berg.\n\"We have seen very high airfare throughout the summer. I would say from the perspective of June and July, it was the highest airfare that we've seen from the U.S. to Europe in the last five or six years at least,\" she said.\nFollowing the pandemic disruptions to the industry, some American and European airlines no longer operate transatlantic flights or haven't brought back as many routes. The industry also faces labour challenges, relatively high jet fuel prices and limitations at some airports.\nWestJet has \ncut\n several region routes in Canada but added more international seats out of Calgary.\n\"WestJet has seen an increased demand for U.S.-based transatlantic travel that exceeds all years prior to 2023,\" WestJet spokesperson Julia Kaiser said in an e-mailed statement. \n\"This increase, alongside significant demand of our Canadian-based guests, has resulted in WestJet adding transatlantic flights and destinations by welcoming Tokyo-Narita to our network and increasing service to Paris to a year-round cadence.\" \nAir Canada slashing routes out of Calgary in face of ongoing pilot shortage\nTourists struggle to change travel bookings in response to B.C.'s wildfire restrictions\nChoosing Calgary\nThe number of U.S. travellers is \"very important for WestJet, no doubt about it,\" said Grant, the analyst with OAG. \nCalgary is a good connection from many cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and Portland, but it's still a relatively small international hub airport, Grant said.\n\"It's also about price and you're dealing with people at the most price-sensitive point in the market. They don't have brand loyalty to WestJet, they have brand loyalty to their personal income and expenditure. So it would be folly to place more and more capacity on the basis purely of the connecting markets,\" he said.\nFor Gillease, who had flown with WestJet several years ago, the flights from San Francisco to Calgary to Paris were a \"lovely\" experience in terms of food, customer service and comfy seats, she said. \nWATCH | Massive backlog of compensation complaints\nProposed changes to air passenger protections as complaints soar\n2 months ago\nDuration \n2:01\nUnfortunately, upon arriving in Paris, her husband's luggage didn't turn up.

As an athlete, you always want to control your own destiny. That's been the tough part.\"\nThe trials were originally scheduled for Dec. 28-Jan. 2 in Portage la Prairie, Man., but were cancelled on Boxing Day. The federation cited travel risks and positive cases among athletes for its decision.\nOlympic mixed doubles play begins Feb. 2 at the Ice Cube in Beijing, two days before the opening ceremony.

Curling Canada doesn't allow curlers to play in both disciplines at the same Games.\nHoman and Morris, currently ranked fifth in Canada, are both available for selection this time around. Now they just have to cross their fingers and hope they get the nod when the decision is finally made.\n\"It's definitely hard on the heart,\" Homan said Tuesday from Beaumont, Alta.\nJocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant are ranked No. 1 in Canada but both are already Beijing-bound after victories in the four-player team trials last November in Saskatoon.\nPeterman helped Team Jennifer Jones to victory and Gallant helped Team Brad Gushue win the men's berth. Jones and Brent Laing are ranked second in mixed doubles.\nGiven the unique scenario, it's possible — although seemingly unlikely — that Curling Canada could make an exception to its rule. Many countries allow players to compete in both disciplines at the Games, but it appears doubtful the Canadian federation would want to disrupt team plans at this late date.\nNancy Martin and Tyrel Griffith are ranked third ahead of Lisa Weagle and John Epping. Weagle is part of Jones's five-player team but is eligible for mixed doubles since she's listed as an alternate for Beijing.\nAnother potential contender is the duo of Kerri Einarson and Brad Jacobs. Einarson, who won the Canadian mixed doubles title last season with Gushue, planned to play the trials with Jacobs.\n'You can't go and prove yourself'\nRankings and recent results will likely impact the decision-making process. Experience in major events like world championships and Olympic Games could also be factors.\nMorris said he was \"champing at the bit\" to get on the ice before the playdowns were cancelled.\n\"Rachel and I had a great training camp leading up to the trials,\" he said in a recent interview. \"We were so ready to go. That's the hard part.

Rather than let the team play with a substitute, the OCA declared that Team Hollie Duncan would get the nod as Team Ontario if Homan were not available.\nThat Curling Show\nCanadian mixed doubles curlers in flux, air thoughts on Olympic selection process\nCurlers await looming Olympic team decision after cancellation of mixed doubles trials\nCourtney, reached Saturday in Edmonton, said the team was \"definitely surprised\" at the association's \"contingency plan.\"\n\"Really disappointed,\" she said. \"A lot of emotions yesterday. It has been tough to take. Obviously we appreciate that it's hard for everyone. Selection is never an ideal situation for any team.\"\nCanada's Olympic mixed doubles trials were cancelled on Boxing Day due to COVID-19 issues. Pandemic restrictions forced the recent cancellation of Ontario's playdowns as well.\nWith the regular playdown process wiped out, Curling Canada will pick a pairing — in consultation with Own the Podium and the Canadian Olympic Committee — to wear the Maple Leaf at the Feb. 4-20 Beijing Games.\nAn announcement on the selection is expected sometime next week. Homan and John Morris, who teamed with Kaitlyn Lawes to win gold in the discipline's Olympic debut in 2018, are considered strong contenders.\nWATCH l Mixed doubles curlers debate who should represent Canada at the Olympics:\nMixed doubles curlers debate who should represent Canada at the Olympics\n2 years ago\nDuration \n1:12:06\nWith a mixed doubles gold medal to defend, curlers Kerri Einarson, Wayne and Kim Tuck, Tyrel Griffith and Chelsea Carey weigh in on who they think should represent Canada.\nThe OCA cited the Canadian Team Ranking System (CTRS), strength of field data and competition history in its final decision. Homan's team is ranked fifth in Canada, just a few points ahead of Duncan.\n\"Our mindset, thinking if we were to be selected and if Rachel were to be made unavailable, we would have been thrilled to choose one of the top Ontario curlers,\" Courtney said. \"We'd have them come into the lineup and see how far we could go and see what we could do. Playing in the Scotties is one of the biggest thrills.\"\nDuncan, meanwhile, said it has been a \"roller-coaster of emotions\" over the last week.\n\"Obviously you want to win your province and earn your way there but if we were given the opportunity to represent Ontario we would be extremely honoured and excited,\" she said in a text message.\n\"Hopefully the decision about mixed doubles doesn't take too much longer.\"\nDetails still not clear\nIn its news release, the OCA did not provide details on why Team Homan could not use a sub or alternate player if needed.\nHowever, in an email exchange later in the day, OCA executive director Stephen Chenier said the Homan rink would fall behind Duncan by a \"significant amount of points\" if they brought in a replacement.\nEssentially, Chenier said, points were earned by the team as a whole but if a player were to leave, they would take their rankings points with them.\n\"In this case with such a close race is it fair to Team Duncan that Team Homan gets to field a different squad [than] what earned the points,\" Chenier said in an email.\nNorthern Ontario curling teams disappointed no qualifiers for national championships\nFor a team to count CTRS points toward its total, it must have at least three of four registered players on the ice at events.\nIt wasn't immediately clear why Homan's points would be taken away for a potential one-time scheduling conflict or why the team couldn't play as a threesome if required.\nA follow-up email to Chenier wasn't immediately returned.\n'We're definitely confused'\n\"I would say we're definitely confused about the ruling,\" Courtney told The Canadian Press. \"Someone getting the highest honour in sport — to go to the Olympics — having that be a limiting factor for the remaining three out of four to continue to compete, we're definitely confused there.\"\nThird-ranked Laura Walker, who has subbed on Homan's team in the past, weighed in on the issue via Twitter.\n\"So if Rachel got sick or injured before the Scotties, TeamHoman could still play with 3/4. But if she goes to represent our country, they can't? I'm confused. Aren't there 4 people on a curling team?\" she tweeted.\nTeam Kevin Koe lead Ben Hebert didn't mince words with his thoughts on the OCA statement.\n\"Full on dumpster fire release here!!!,\" Hebert tweeted, complete with head-smack and vomit emojis.\nTeam John Epping vice Ryan Fry also weighed in.\n\"Congrats on the Scotties berth, kinda? Nice position to put a player in,\" he tweeted.\nSubstitutes unusual, but sometimes needed in curling\nWhile rare, substitute players are occasionally needed at big events.\nOne notable example came at the 2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts. Team Jennifer Jones brought in Shannon Birchard at vice to replace Lawes, who was competing at the Pyeongchang Olympics.\nJones won the competition and Lawes later returned to the lineup to help the team win world gold.\nHoman and Morris, meanwhile, are fifth in the Canadian mixed doubles rankings but both have Olympic experience.\nJocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant are ranked No. 1 in Canada but they are already Beijing-bound after victories in the four-player team trials (with Team Jennifer Jones and Team Brad Gushue, respectively).\nMore Curling coverage\nCurling Canada rules prevent athletes from playing in both disciplines at the same Games.\nJones and Brent Laing are ranked second ahead of Nancy Martin and Tyrel Griffith and the duo of Lisa Weagle and John Epping. Weagle is part of Jones's five-player team but is eligible for mixed doubles since she's listed as an alternate for Beijing.\nAnother potential contender is the duo of Kerri Einarson and Brad Jacobs. Einarson, who won the Canadian mixed doubles title last season with Gushue, had planned to play the trials with Jacobs.\n\"With mixed doubles getting cancelled, we've all been hoping and supporting and really staying excited for Rachel,\" Courtney said. \"We want her to go to the Olympics. That would be such a thrill.\n\"She's a phenomenal curler, she's a phenomenal mixed doubles player.

But if he had ordered it from the U.S., it would have cost $22.99 to ship.\n\"I buy stuff off of eBay reasonably often, and I'm always surprised how much it costs to ship things from the U.S. as compared to from China,\" Pitman told \nCost of Living\n.\n\"It costs almost nothing to ship from China. And I'd like to buy American or Canadian. But even from the next province, it costs way more.\"\nSerasu Duran, a University of Calgary assistant professor of operations and supply chain management in the Haskayne School of Business, says it can cost about $5 or $6 per kilogram to ship a package from China to Canada. \n\"Which is quite cheap,\" said Duran. \nAccording to Canada Post's shipping rate calculator, it can cost about $24 to send a one-kilogram package between provinces. And it would cost $28.50 to send a one-kilogram package from Canada to China, depending on its size.\nThe reason for that dates all the way back to 1874 and an international agency called the Universal Postal Union. \nThe history of post\nIt used to be quite difficult to send a letter from one country to another, according to Paulus Schoorl, program manager and policy and regulatory adviser for the Universal Postal Union in Bern, Switzerland.\nIf you sent a letter through multiple countries, you'd have to pay big bucks, he said. Each time mail crossed a border, it would incur an additional cost for the sender.\n\"It was awfully complex and difficult to send a letter from one country to another country, actually, sometimes across different jurisdictions or administrative areas,\" said Schoorl.\nChina found itself with a major competitive advantage as e-commerce took off in the 2010s because of its cheap shipping rates. \n \n(Chinatopix/The Associated Press)\nThat led to representatives meeting in Bern, Switzerland, in 1874 and signing the Treaty of Bern, leading to the creation of the Universal Postal Union. It was an agreement that countries would carry other countries' letters and small parcels for free.\n\"At that point, it was decided that all the [postal] services are universal service,\" said Schoorl. \nThe idea was it would all balance out, with each country helping the other.\nAn imbalance\nAfter 100 years, there was a change. \nSchoorl says that Italy felt there was an imbalance. Italian postal carriers were delivering more international mail, as people there were ordering heavy magazines. Meanwhile, the country wasn't sending out nearly as much mail as it was receiving. \nCBC Investigates\nHow a post-9/11 cargo screening rule means N.L. consumers may pay more, wait longer for goods\nSending a package any time soon? Brace for an expensive surprise\nIn the 1960s, countries that were a part of the Universal Postal Union came to a new agreement. If a country was receiving more international mail than it was sending, it would be paid for the difference.\nAt the time, that was one half of a gold franc, a currency formerly used by international organizations, per kilogram of international mail. But not all countries could afford it. \nDuring Donald Trump's time as U.S. president in 2018, he threatened to pull the the country out of the Universal Postal Union.\n \n(James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)\nThe Universal Postal Union set up a fee so richer countries would pay more to have their international mail delivered than countries with developing economies. \n\"The central idea is that any citizen or business should be able to send mail packages through the Global Postal Network to any destination,\" said Schoorl.\nAt the time, China was considered a country with a developing economy, meaning the country would be charged less for international mail than other countries. And that went unchanged for decades. \nWhere we are now\nAs e-commerce took off in the 2010s, China found itself with a major competitive advantage. It could ship to North America at a cheap rate. Canada Post and the U.S. Postal Service were delivering packages and not being compensated very well, says Schoorl.\nIn 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump pushed back on the rates and threatened to pull the country out of the Universal Postal Union. \nThe United States and other countries, including Canada, were able to negotiate a new deal withing the Universal Postal Union. \nFree online returns cost retailers millions.

When Homan won the right to compete for Canada in 2018 in Pyeongchang with her team, Morris had to find a new partner — he teamed up with Lawes and the two immediately found chemistry and won gold.\nBeijing Bound\nAthletes named to Canada's Beijing Olympic team\nCBC announces programming details, broadcast team for 2022 Winter Olympics\nHoman says despite the small timeframe to prepare for the Olympics, she's confident her and Morris will be ready for competition.\n\"We both have tremendous respect for each other.

John Morris and Rachel Homan will defend the mixed doubles gold medal that Morris won in 2018 with former teammate Kaitlyn Lawes.\nHoman and Morris were among the 16 teams that were supposed to compete for Canada's spot in the Olympic tournament at the national mixed doubles trials in Manitoba before the event was cancelled last month. A Curling Canada-led committee spent the last few weeks deciding which duo to send to China, weighing factors including recent mixed-doubles performance along with international success in traditional curling. Another flashy pairing in the running was reigning Scotties champ Kerri Einarson and 2014 Olympic men's gold medallist Brad Jacobs. There was also considerable lobbying from players who devote themselves to mixed doubles and believe that should count.\nBut, in the end, talent won out. If the goal is to send the team with the highest ceiling, then the selection committee settled on the most obvious pick. Morris, 43, is a proven Olympic performer who won a men's gold medal as the third for Kevin Martin in 2010 before taking the mixed doubles title with Lawes in 2018. The 32-year-old Homan is one of the most successful curlers ever, with three Scotties titles and a world championship in her trophy case. And theirs is no shotgun partnership. Homan and Morris have played mixed doubles together since 2015. Morris turned to Lawes four years ago after Homan won the Canadian women's trials, which made her ineligible for Olympic mixed doubles because of the Curling Canada policy prohibiting anyone from competing in more than one curling event at the same Games.\nAs for Lawes, she's heading to Beijing too as a member of the Jennifer Jones-skipped rink that won the Canadian women's trials in November. Brad Gushue's team won the men's. In Gushue and Jones, Canada will have a former Olympic gold medallist at skip in both of the traditional curling tournaments in Beijing.\nNow that we finally know everyone who's playing for Canada, let's take a quick look at the three Olympic curling tournaments and what the Canadian teams are facing:\nMixed doubles\nFirst, let's appreciate the simplicity of the Olympic curling tournaments. All three events start with a 10-team round robin, and the top four advance to the semifinals. The semifinal winners play for gold. The semifinal losers play for bronze. No Page playoffs, no weird triple-knockout brackets to decipher. Easy.\nIn 2018, when mixed doubles made its Olympic debut with an eight-team event, Morris and Lawes were a wrecking ball. After losing their opener to Norway, they reeled off eight straight wins to take gold, including a 10-3 demolition of Switzerland in the final.\nThe silver-medal Swiss duo of Jenny Perret and Martin Rios are back for Beijing. So is the Norwegian pairing of Kristin Skaslien and Magnus Nedregotten, who were awarded bronze after the man on the Russian team that beat them failed a doping test. Besides Homan, the only other big-name skip involved in the mixed doubles tournament is Great Britain's Bruce Mouat, a two-time European men's champ who took silver at the men's worlds last year.\nA big storyline in Beijing will be Homan's attempt to redeem herself from a disastrous showing in the women's event in 2018. Her team went 4-5 and became the first Canadian rink to miss the playoffs at the Olympics.\nThe mixed doubles event gets underway Feb. 2 at 7:05 a.m. ET, and Homan and Morris play their first game that night at 8:05 p.m. ET vs. Great Britain. The semifinals are on the morning of Feb. 7 in Canadian time zones, and the gold-medal game is the next day at 7:05 a.m. ET.\nMen's\nCanada also flopped in this event in 2018, with Kevin Koe's team losing in the semifinals to eventual champion John Shuster of the U.S. and then getting upset by Switzerland in the bronze-medal game. Before these Games, no Canadian curling team had ever failed to win a medal. In Pyeongchang, both traditional teams did.\nFor Gushue, a lot has changed since he won his Olympic gold medal in Italy 16 years ago. Back then, he was a talented yet still somewhat raw youngster who threw fourth rocks but leaned on the legendary Russ Howard to call games from the second position (in the official Olympic records, Howard is listed as the skip). Now Gushue is all grown up — a 41-year-old father of two who's fully in command of his craft. He captured three Brier titles from 2017-20 and a world championship in '17. Gushue took care of business as the favourite at the Canadian trials in November, losing only one game en route to defeating Jacobs in the final.\nThe competition in Beijing will be tough. It includes Shuster, Mouat and five-time world champion Nik Edin of Sweden, who's looking for his first Olympic gold after taking bronze in 2014 and silver in '18. The tournament opens Feb. 8 at 7:05 a.m. ET, when Canada faces Denmark. The semis are the morning of Feb. 17 in Canadian time zones, and the gold-medal game is Feb. 18 at 1:05 a.m. ET.\nWomen's\nJennifer Jones is curling royalty — the winner of a record-tying six Scotties, a two-time world champion and an Olympic gold medallist in 2014. But her victory at the Canadian trials was somewhat of a surprise. At 47, Jones was considered to be past her prime, and most observers rated her behind Homan, Einarson and the red-hot Tracy Fleury. Sure enough, Jones lost to all of them in the round robin. But when the chips were down she came through, trouncing Krista McCarville in the semis before stealing the final from an undefeated Fleury in an extra end.\nIn Beijing, Jones will be up against all three medallists from 2018: defending champ Anna Hasselborg of Sweden, South Korea's Kim Eun-jung (silver) and Japan's Satsuki Fujisawa (bronze). There's also the winner of the last two world championships — Switzerland's Silvana Tirinzoni — and 2013 world champ Eve Muirhead of Great Britain, who took Olympic bronze in 2014.\nThe women's tournament starts Feb. 9 at 8:05 p.m. ET, and Canada plays its first game Feb. 10 at 7:05 a.m. ET vs. South Korea. The semifinals go in the morning of Feb. 18 in Canadian time zones, and the final is Feb. 19 at 8:05 p.m. ET.\nRead more about today's mixed doubles team announcement in \nthis story\n by CBC Sports' Devin Heroux.

This is why it's so concerning\n\"If you think of a tropical cyclone in general, it intensifies by extracting energy from the ocean,\" said Karthik Balaguru, a scientist for coastal modelling at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Seattle.\n\"So in a broader kind of perspective, if the oceans are warming up more and more as the climate changes, then they will provide a more favourable environment for the storms to intensify.\".\nBalaguru said the temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico \nare 1 C to 2 C warmer than normal\n.\nThis illustration shows the sea surface temperature anomaly in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida.\n \n(CBC)\nWhat is rapid intensification?\n\"Usually, tropical storms, hurricanes, increase in intensity at a relatively steady rate,\" said Gabriel A. Vecchi, professor of geosciences at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\"Sometimes they'll stay at a certain intensity. But every now and again, they'll undergo the process, which we call rapid intensification. And that is when a hurricane jumps the equivalent of one or so intensity classes in less than 24 hours.\"\nThat's exactly what happened with Hurricane Idalia.\nVecchi said although rapid intensification has occurred in roughly five per cent of hurricanes, that number is changing.\n\"The probability of it happening now is considerably more than five per cent,\" he said. \"And it's it's been growing over the last 40 years. We see that increase, not just in the Atlantic Ocean. It's been sort of relatively throughout the tropics.\"\nBut it's not all about warmer ocean waters. The atmosphere — specifically wind shear — also plays a vital role in strengthening hurricanes. Wind shear is the change in wind speed as it rises into the atmosphere.\nOur oceans are hotter than ever. Scientists say they worry about what that means for our future\nHurricane Idalia sweeps into Georgia after swamping Florida coast\nAs the winds of a hurricane rush into the storm's centre, they pick up moisture from the ocean's surface before spiralling upwards in the eye wall, or the centre of the hurricane. However, if you have high wind shear, dry air moves in, reducing that moisture and helping to destabilize a tropical storm. But if you have low wind shear, that keeps the storm going and can also help to intensify it.\nBalaguru recently published a \nstudy in Science that suggested wind shear along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts is decreasing\n, which just adds further fuel to hurricane intensification.\nWhile rapid intensification is of deep concern, especially in coastal cities — as has been seen with Hurricane Idalia, Vecchi said that forecasts are improving, which is saving lives.\n\"There's a story of the 1900 hurricane in Galveston, Texas,\" he said of the hurricane \nthat killed between 6,000 and 12,000 people\n. \"What you see there is the consequences of a storm in a world where we don't have predictions, or at least we are not using the predictions that there were. With the storms that we have now, I can imagine it being a lot worse.\"\nAt the time of publication, no deaths from Hurricane Idalia had been reported.\n\"I hope that everybody is safe, as best as possible,\" Vecchi said. \"And that as much property is saved as possible. And if that continues to be the story, I can't imagine that the quality of the forecasts — that communication, the fact that the various media were involved in all of this — didn't play some role.\"\nWATCH | Severe marine heat wave impacting Atlantic hurricane season\nSevere marine heat wave impacting Atlantic hurricane season\n9 days ago\nDuration \n0:57\nCBC News science and climate specialist Darius Mahdavi breaks down how record-warm ocean waters mean Canada could be in a dangerous situation heading into the peak of Atlantic hurricane season should any make landfall here.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

And so, they started using the only thing they had left, which is their feet.\n\"We wanted to understand what drives the evolution of that.\"\nThe study of more than 1,000 species found that all birds that use their feet for tasks other than perching are part of a large-brained clade of birds known as core land birds or \nTelluraves\n. A clade is a large group of species that all trace back to a common ancestor.\nAn ancient ancestor \nThe findings suggest that birds made better use of their feet, not just their beaks, as they adapted to grasping branches in the forest canopy.\nIt all began 60 million years ago, when the clade's common ancestor, likely a predator, moved from the forest floor to the trees.\nJust like modern tree-dwelling birds, early birds of the \nTelluraves\n clade had long back toes that would have worked almost like a thumb for clasping. They also had toe tendons that provided them stronger holds on perches.\nThe study found the family tree diverged repeatedly through the generations as birds adapted to their diet or surroundings. Adaptations happened at least 20 times, the study found, as birds further specialized their footwork for tasks like cracking nuts or clawing at prey.\nAmazingly well-preserved fossil egg shows link between dinosaurs and birds\nWhat fossil eggs found in Alberta reveal about how dinosaurs became birds\nThe study was borne out of unexpected circumstances.\nIt all started with owl brains.\nGutiérrez-Ibáñez and his team were planning a lab-based study in Brazil examining owls' neural pathways. But when the pandemic put those plans — and the brain specimens — on ice, the team came up with a new plan.\nResearchers began poring through millions of photos and videos of birds and eventually selected 3,725 images for further examination.\nThe study authors relied on various online scientific archives, with the bulk of the images coming from the research archive at Macaulay Library. The online library — affiliated with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y. — is the world's largest repository of bird photos. \nThe study was a unique opportunity, thanks in large part to the fact that people love taking pictures of birds, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez said.  \n\"Suddenly, I realized that there was a huge amount of pictures and videos on the internet of birds and this particular behaviour is very suited for that because the birds do it when they're sitting still.\n\"It's one behaviour that you can actually study, even from just a picture.\" \nRelying on thousands of images from birders, researchers investigated how some birds became more talented with their talons. Magpies were among the most nimble-footed, the study found. \n \n(Kathryn Keith)\nThe study found there was a diversity of skills. Parrots were the most dexterous of the bunch. They can grasp, twist their claws and bring their feet up to their beaks. Next up would be raptors, such as owls and vultures. \nSome corvids like magpies, however, are only capable of holding an object against a branch. Most songbird species have limited grasping ability or none at all.\nIt's unclear exactly why each adaptation occurred. Various evolutionary pressures, including changes in habitat and diet, were likely at play, Gutiérrez-Ibáñez said.\nHe said the question of birds' dexterity is a largely ignored behaviour. But, ultimately, a better understanding of bird feet may help scientists better understand the evolution of bird brains.\n\"We know from other research that these core land birds have large brains, and we think that they might have also different connections, something similar to what happens in mammals where there are direct connections to the motor centres that control limb movement,\" he said.\n\"It's very likely that these birds evolved something to be able to control that behaviour that other birds don't have.\"\nQuirks & Quarks\nScientists discover wild baby parrots babble like human babies\nAs It Happens\nParrots who learn to video call feathered friends feel less lonely, study finds\nPeter Arcese, a professor of conservation sciences at the University of British Columbia, said the study is a clever approach to community-based science, one that allowed researchers to provide broad findings in a relatively short time. \nArcese was not involved in the study.

Ham radio might be able to help", "summary": "After post-tropical storm Fiona knocked out communications networks in parts of the province, some emergency managers started looking to amateur radio as a backup in future disasters.", "content": "As Atlantic Canada gears up for another hurricane season after a year of unprecedented disasters linked to climate change — including post-tropical storm Fiona last September — amateur radio operators say a simple technology can play a part in the response to disasters across the region.\nWhen Fiona hit Nova Scotia, it affected electrical grids and telecommunications networks, leaving some people unable to call for help. That experience in particular prompted a renewed interest in amateur radio — also known as ham radio — which allows non-professional users to send messages without requiring the internet or cell phone networks. \n\"I think it's kind of an unsung hero in communications that gets forgotten in the noise of disaster when it comes to, 'Well, how do we get that message out?'\" said John Bignell, president of the Halifax Amateur Radio Club. \nHam radio operators use a special designated set of frequencies — not the regular AM or FM radio signals — to exchange messages locally or around the world.\nThey say the technology can help Nova Scotians respond to the increasing risks of extreme weather, as climate change forces a reckoning with communications infrastructure across the country.\nCommunications failed following Fiona\nWhen Lyle Donovan became emergency management co-ordinator for Victoria County in 2008, the municipality's emergency plan included amateur radio, drawing on the expertise of a local group.\n\"They were an older generation, but they were active in amateur radio and we utilized them,\" he said.\nIn time, that group petered out. With no operators left in the county, Donovan removed the section on amateur radio when he redid the municipality's emergency plan in 2016.\n\"What's the point in having it in our emergency plan if we had no operators?\" he remembered thinking.\nIn the past, amateur radio held more appeal, Donovan said, but other forms of communication had become ubiquitous in the meantime, and amateur radio no longer seemed necessary.\nDowned utility lines and poles lie across Woodlawn Road in Dartmouth in the wake of Fiona.\n \n(Submitted by Joshawa Tyler LaVoie)\nMore to the point, Nova Scotia and Atlantic Canada more broadly already have a highly stable radio network, Donovan said. All frontline emergency services in the province use the trunked mobile radio system, which was put in place after the SwissAir disaster in 1998. Donovan calls it \"the best communications systems in the world.\"\n\"So we got kind of complacent to think that we have this system, we have VHF, we have satellite telephone and of course, we still have our cell phones and not all of those systems are going to go down.\"\nThen post-tropical storm Fiona struck. \nThe day after the storm made landfall in the province, Donovan, who is a paramedic, woke at 5 a.m. to prepare for work. Attempting to turn on the TV, he realized there was no power; turning to his phone, he found there was no cell service either. Because the local radio tower was down, local emergency services could talk to each other but couldn't send messages outside of the immediate area. \nLandlines weren't usable for most Nova Scotians during Fiona\nCell outages during storms like Fiona will continue unless regulations improve, advocate says\n\"That's when I knew we were in trouble,\" he said. Then, with communications interrupted, \"Lo and behold, [there was] a cardiac arrest.\"\nThe family of the victim was unable to call 911. While their neighbour was an RCMP corporal with a TMR radio, they were unable to call for help because they couldn't communicate with the wider network.\nEventually, someone was able to get a message to Donovan via the local fire chief. But by then 40 minutes had passed and the victim couldn't be saved. \n\"I have a close personal relationship with the family,\" he said. \"We went on to discover that [medical attention] wouldn't have helped anyway, but it's just sheer fact that people were not able to call 911.\"\nIn the aftermath of Fiona, Donovan said they started asking how the situation could have been avoided, and — after connecting with a longstanding amateur radio club in Halifax — started looking to amateur radio. \n\"Somebody from my area could have called someone in the Halifax area, and they could have called 911 for us, to get emergency services rolling,\" he said. \nThe Halifax Amateur Radio Club is one of the oldest in the country, having started in 1932.\n \n(Moira Donovan)\nThe Halifax Amateur Radio Club is one of the oldest amateur radio clubs in North America, dating back to 1932. \nBignell first got interested in amateur radio as a teenager. He said its simplicity is part of its enduring appeal.\n\"The ability to build your own radio and then send a message that bounces around the atmosphere and be able to talk around the world with a simple little wire, it's kind of cool,\" he said.\nBut amateur radio is more than a hobby; because it doesn't require a service provider such as a telecommunications company, or extensive infrastructure, it can step in during disasters when other systems fail.\nThis has been true with disasters in the past. Bignell said his club has played a role in every major disaster in the province going back to the Moose River mine disaster in 1936.\nAmateur radio has also been essential elsewhere. Amateur radio operators were instrumental in relaying messages around New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina knocked out telecommunications networks. In Mozambique, a recent series of storms has prompted the government to set up a network of amateur radio operators to help with disaster response.\nWhat Canada can learn from how the U.S. handles cell outages in hurricanes\nWhile communications infrastructure has steadily improved in the last 20 years, Bignell said amateur radio still provides an additional layer of safety.\n\"We have some really robust systems in Nova Scotia and in Canada, but there's always that one moment where you go 'Oh this isn't going well, we need a backup,' and that's where amateur radio plays a real key role.\"\nJohn Bignell is president of the Halifax Amateur Radio Club.\n \n(Moira Donovan)\nBignell said amateur radio also works with more modern technology through tools such as Winlink, which radio operators can use to send emails, weather reports and information bulletins over the airwaves, without internet. \nAmateur radio is undergoing a renaissance, Bignell said, in part because the ability to connect amateur radios to laptops and cell phones has greatly increased what it can do.\nThat surge of interest is coming at a time when Canada is taking a closer look at the resilience of its telecommunications infrastructure. \nThe federal government recently began a process to improve the resilience and reliability of telecommunications networks, citing disasters such as hurricanes Fiona and Dorian in Atlantic Canada, the forest fires in Alberta and B.C. in 2021, and the derecho storm that struck Ontario and Quebec in 2022. \nIn a notice of consultation, the CRTC noted that the increasing risks posed by climate change have made it necessary to build a more robust telecommunications system. \nJason Tremblay is community services officer for Radio Amateurs of Canada, a nationwide volunteer-based network of amateur radio operators. \n \n(Jason Tremblay)\nJason Tremblay,  community services officer for Radio Amateurs of Canada, a national volunteer-based network of amateur radio operators, said that the organization is pushing for amateur radio to be included in more conversations about strengthening communications systems.\n\"Being able to work with government agencies, work with NGOs and members of the community, it's a way for us to understand what their needs are — it's a way to better our service.\"\nHe said as technologies and climate conditions change, amateur radio operators are taking on new methods and challenges in disaster response. \n\"There's been an explosion of interest from emergency managers,\" he said. \"I think there will always be a call for amateur radio; it'll always adapt and be there.\"\nBringing ham radio back\nIn Victoria County, Donovan is now looking to re-introduce amateur radio to the municipality's emergency management plan, and has heard there's at least one radio operator in the county who is interested in helping out. \nDonovan is also hoping to bolster interest in an amateur radio club in the county. \nHe stressed that what happened to emergency communications after Fiona was a rare occurrence.\nStill, he thinks amateur radio could form an additional layer, to help the public feel safe in the disasters to come. \n\"Amateur radio is certainly still a benefit to Nova Scotia. It's a backup system, and in the event that something happens, it's something that we could use.\"\nMORE TOP STORIES \nProvince expected to announce plans for community involvement in schools this fall\nRenters with pets need protection in tenancy rules, says animal-welfare charity\nN.S. fire chief wants protection for volunteers who respond to emergencies while on the job\nVideo\nWhy Starlink is a flawed lifeline for some Nova Scotians\nFederal government spends $2M on clean tech research in Cape Breton", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The species's more unique traits include loud nocturnal barking and \"crabbing\" (a weird sound, like metal caught in a paper shredder) when annoyed.\nDid we mention that they have sharp teeth and claws and can't be house-trained?\nBigger is better when it comes to sugar glider cages. Boyé keeps her sugar gliders in custom-built, floor-to-ceiling mesh reptariums, which can be dismantled and cleaned in the washing machine. \n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nBoyé, on the other hand, was charmed. Demon's soft, grey fur reminded her of the pussy willows she used to collect as a kid.\n\"I like little, tiny fuzzy things,\" she said.\nA decade later, she owns 10 sugar gliders: three breeding pairs, and a pet colony of four. One of the females recently gave birth to two joeys that Boyé nicknamed Barnum and Bailey.\nShe keeps them in a towering complex of mesh cages, which reaches to the ceiling of a spare room. They're filled with toys, snuggly fleece pouches, and hand-sewn accessories. During the day, the gliders tend to hang out nestled in a big ball inside their enclosures.\nFluffer, a two-year-old sugar glider, waits expectantly for a tasty mealworm treat. One thing would-be owners might want to consider is 'what [sugar gliders] might do to the smell of your home.'\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nHer two big dogs — a Saint Bernard named Dazey, and Tesla, a Bernese-lab cross — tend to steer clear. They're freaked out by the noises the sugar gliders make.\nSince she started breeding them four years ago, Boyé has adopted out more than 100 sugar gliders to homes across Canada, from Newfoundland and Labrador to British Columbia. Depending on their markings and whether or they've been fixed, the price tag ranges from $300 to $500.\nBoyé has also helped re-home some 30 gliders that were surrendered by their owners when the demands of the little animals became too much.\nBoyé is sympathetic. While she adores the little guys, she said, they're definitely \"not for everybody.\"\nOK, why not?\nSugar gliders are peculiar little creatures.\nTo start, there's their diet: a special goulash of yogurt, eggs or chicken, applesauce, calcium and other vitamins, fresh fruit and veggies. As special treats, they get mealworms, hornworms, and beetles. Boyé keeps plastic trays full of live bugs for this purpose. But not too many. \"They go straight to their hips,\" she said. \nThey can't be kept by themselves — they need the company of at least one other sugar glider \"or they lose their little minds,\" Boyé said. They can't swim, which means they can drown easily in, say, a toilet bowl if the seat is left up. They have a gremlin-like aversion to bright lights.\nMealworms and bugs are a favourite snack of sugar gliders.\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nWhat Cook, the vet, calls a \"musky odour\" emanates from from scent glands \"on their forehead, near their front legs, and around the hind end.\n\"Sometimes I've heard the smell likened to the smell of a puppy,\" he said. (Boyé said neutering the males drastically reduces this.) They're nocturnal, which means they sleep all day and run around, barking and literally climbing the walls, all night.\n\"So if you're getting them for your five-year-old child, that's not going to be so great,\" Boyé said.\nGwynn Boyé, with Fluffer, started breeding sugar gliders as a hobby four years ago and hopes to collect one in every colour.  \n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nFor a small animal, gliders have a remarkably long lifespan.\n\"Some live up to 16 years,\"  said Boyé. \"Eight to 12 is the average. It's a commitment, like a dog or a cat. It's not like a hamster that's going to die in two or three years.\"\nAlso like a dog, a glider needs a lot of human contact.\n\"If they aren't properly socialized they can be mean,\" Boyé said. \"I've had some that were genuinely mean little buggers.\"\n'My cat is terrified of them'\nKatelyn Forbes of Fredericton knows some of the challenges firsthand.\nShe and her boyfriend own two sugar gliders: Julian, a 2 ½-year-old grey male, and Luna, a leucistic (all-white) one-year-old female.\nForbes's boyfriend ordered Julian from an online breeder, not fully prepared for everything the pet would need. Pretty soon, it became evident that Julian wasn't doing too well on his own.\n\"They have to be in pairs or they're prone to self-mutilate,\" said Forbes. \"They will over-groom themselves and start biting themselves. Then they can get infections and eventually die. They can even stop eating. It's not good.\"\nOnce Forbes purchased Luna from Fundy Sugar Gliders, \"it took two months to get them in the same cage together,\" Forbes said.\nFredericton sugar glider owner Katelyn Forbes with her two sugar gliders, Julian, left, and Luna.\n \n(Submitted by Katelyn Forbes)\n\"Now, they just love each other and are always with each other.\"\nForbes spends hours prepping fresh food for Julian and Luna, which she makes ahead of time and freezes in ice cube trays. Then there's cleaning the cages every morning, and playing with them for an hour every evening.\n\"My cat is actually terrified of them,\" said Forbes.\nShe has some advice for would-be owners.\n\"They are a lot to take on,\" she said. \"I wouldn't trade them for the world and I love doing it, but a lot of people wouldn't be able to devote that much time to them.\"\nCook said they'd be great for someone who wants a needy, interactive pet they don't have to take for walks.\nFluffer chows down on a worm. Sugar gliders, like flying squirrels, have a patagium: a fold of skin between the foreleg and hind leg, pictured. In the wild, glide up to 50 metres from treetop to treetop. \n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\n\"They fill a niche for people that really want to interact [with their pets] but maybe can't interact inside and out the way you would with a dog.\"\nBoyé, a medic at Ambulance New Brunswick, recalled a military member with post-traumatic stress disorder who adopted two of her sugar gliders.\n\"[He] wanted them for therapy animals,\" she said. \"Sugar gliders were his thing, and he absolutely adored them.\"  \nIn the wild sugar gliders eat flowers, nectar, eucalyptus tree sap, acacia gum, and insects. In captivity, they need a varied hash of yogurt, protein, vitamins, fresh fruit and veggies. They get mealworms, pictured, as a special treat.\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)\nIf their popularity in the United States is any indication, sugar gliders will continue to make their way into more homes in Atlantic Canada.\n\"Ten years ago there were three people in the Maritimes that had them — and I was one,\" Boyé. said. \"Now you're looking at a couple of hundred people.\"\nThey're also showing up in pet stores — a trend that deeply troubles Boyé. At a now-closed big-box pet store in Saint John, she said, employees \"had no idea\" about the sex of two sugar gliders priced at $400 each. They were also \"too young … probably four to five weeks when I saw them, and scared to death.\"\nA pair of five-week-old sugar glider joeys nicknamed Barnum and Bailey cuddle together. Sugar gliders must be kept in colonies of 2 or more or they 'lose their little minds,' said Boyé.\n \n(Julia Wright / CBC)\n\"They can't be socialized in a pet store, because pet stores are open in the day and full of bright lights — everything that they hate.\" \nPeople should never get a glider from the temporary kiosks some backyard breeders set up at fairs, or in shopping malls, \nwhere buyers have run into all kinds of serious problems\n.\n\"The advice I have for people who are thinking about getting them is to do a lot of research,\" Forbes said.\n\"Make sure that you can take care of them properly before you actually get one.\"\nSugar gliders need a lot of human contact.\n \n(Julia Wright/CBC)", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

It's good. It's much better than I thought it was when we first did it, I will say that much, but it's different.\"\nGibbs got the idea while sitting at a bar talking about old beers with a pair of brewmasters.\nThe original recipe was found in the book, \nThe Barbarian's Beverage: A History of Beer in Ancient Europe\n, by Max Nelson at the University of Windsor. It was chosen because Gibbs figured he could stay close to the original process and, unlike some of the other recipes, the ingredients were available and legal.\nBeer made an old-fashioned way is shown at Barn Hammer Brewing Company in Winnipeg on Tuesday.\n \n(David Lipnowski/Canadian Press)\nGibbs received permission to translate the recipe out of ancient Greek and then got to work with brewers Tyler Birch and Brian Westcott, co-owners of Barn Hammer Brewing Co. in Winnipeg.\nFirst, they made a sourdough bread from water and barley flour milled by hand. It took 18 hours to bake the loaves at a heat low enough that the enzymes essential for beer-making stayed alive.\nThe loaves were then submerged in a fermenter at Barn Hammer.\nThe only major differences from the original recipe was that a stainless steel fermenter was used and the barley wasn't malted on a roof in the sun.\nWeeks went by and the experiment slowly turned from a murky mix to a pristine pint.\n\"After tasting the bread they made, I thought we were going to have something really disgusting, but it turned out really well,\" Birch said.\n\"I'm actually blown away by how good it is. It's actually very drinkable.\"\n \nThe simple taste of that makes it quite clear how much the palate has changed over 2,000 years.\n- Matt Gibbs\nIt's not what most people would consider a beer and tastes more like a sour cider with hints of raisin or apple. The drink is flat because there was no carbonation more than 1,000 years ago. The brewers figure the alcohol content is about three per cent, similar to modern light beer.\nThe brew is not for sale — yet — but they are open to marketing an ancient batch in the future.\nThe ale is the beginning of research into how it and other beers were consumed by ancient societies. The initial batch has demonstrated how much brews have changed as technology around beer-making developed, Gibbs said.\n\"There were things we learned in terms of taste and technology and in processing, but I think the most important one was taste,\" he said.\n\"The simple taste of that makes it quite clear how much the palate has changed over 2,000 years.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

On the other hand we may have helped it over a hump and it might do well. Such is wildlife rehab.' \n \n(Dennis Minty Photography)\nSince the bird appeared to be in good shape after its night in the porch, they took it outside and gave it another once over and the last of the tilapia before releasing it at the edge of the river. \n\"And off it went, it seemed fine,\" said Minty.\nIt isn't the first time the couple has helped out a creature in need. \nThey captured an ill red fox from the roadside in the community and brought it to Salmonier Nature Park for rehabilitation, and helped dozens of storm petrels that were blown inshore during bad weather.\nDennis Minty with a Dovekie that turned up on his lawn after an easterly gale in January of 2013.

They called me out of the blue and said 'I have this idea,'\" said Stefan's son, Stan Michalak. \n\"It's not every day the mint calls and says, 'Hey, we're going to do a coin.'\"\nFrom CBC News\nFalcon Lake incident is Canada's 'best-documented UFO case,' even 50 years later\nStefan, whom his son says was a \"rock nut,\" was searching for gold, silver and other precious metals and gems in Whiteshell Provincial Park one May long weekend in 1967. At about noon, two craft appeared in the sky, he said, and one landed about 50 metres away from Stefan on a flat rocky area.\nThe other craft left, but the first stayed, said Stefan. He observed it from the bush for about half an hour before approaching it.\n\"In his mind, he reasoned, 'This must be some sort of a military experimental craft. They've landed here by mistake or maybe out of need. Maybe they're in trouble,'\" said Stan. \"'I'll offer to help them out.'\"\nWhen Stefan approached the craft, which he later described as saucer-shaped and made of a stainless steel material, he touched it and the heat melted the fingertips of his heavy gloves. There was an opening he put his head through, said Stan, but he didn't enter.\nThe craft then expelled a cloud of gas and lifted off, knocking Stefan off his feet, setting his shirt aflame and leaving a distinct pattern of burns on his chest.\nThere will be only 4,000 of the collectors coins minted.\n \n(Royal Canadian Mint)\nThe coin shows the moment the craft lifted from the rock, with a figure lying on the ground with a hand in the air, as if to ward something off. In the dark, the craft on the coin glows, as does the gas coming from the ship.\nThe coin is ovoid and uses more colours than traditionally found in a coin, said Stan.\n\"They sent me a proof that had their original thought, which was kind of cute,\" said Stan. \"Originally, it was going to have alien eyes on it, so it looked like the shape of an alien head.\"\nErica Maga, product manager for the coin, said the idea came to the team during their annual research.\n\"We thought it was such an interesting story that it was one that we had to share with Canadians,\" said Maga. \"Everyone is sort of fascinated by this subject matter and we thought it would make a really interesting coin design.\"\nThe coin has been in production for a few months but went on sale Monday, said Maga. The coin's egg shape, while unusual, was also used for coins with a hot air balloon and featuring Ukranian pysanka.\nMaga confirmed one of the earliest designs featured glow-in-the-dark alien eyes.\n\"We had talked around a lot of really wacky ideas and interesting concepts for this one, but in the end, we wanted to try and stay as faithful and true to the story as we could.\"\nDespite the Manitoba connection, the coin is being minted in Ottawa instead of Winnipeg, said Alex Reeves, external communications advisor for The Mint. The Winnipeg facility does currency coins, while the Ottawa facility specializes in collector coins.\nUFO sightings in Manitoba date back to 1792\nStan, who \nco-wrote a book\n about his father's encounter, said he hopes the coin helps end his family's saga.\n\"We just decided to put this to rest, and I think the mint, giving me a call and saying 'We have this idea,' I think it just puts the ribbon on the box to finally close it forever.\"\nThe $20 legal tender coin can be ordered from \nthe mint's website\n.

Or are they just going with what's practical, comfortable or familiar?\nIt's not your everyday question but I recently asked them:  Councillor, what's your real name?\nWithout further ado, let's meet these councillors. \nCouncillor Harnirjodh Chahal ​\nCoun. George Chahal chose his first name as a child.\n \n(CBC)\nChahal said his birth name is one with religious meanings and comes with a lot of history behind it. \nFrom Punjabi, he said it translates in English as, \"God's immortal warrior.\"\nBut the rookie councillor said, \"I like George.\"\nAnd he has been George since his pre-school days. \nHe recalls how the switch came about as one day, when he was young, he got into trouble for something and he was asked for his name.\n\"I said my name was George Washington.\"\nHuh?\n\"I loved the name George and we've had some amazing people throughout history that were named George so why not?\"\nFrom then, he just kept using the name George.\nChahal said nobody calls him by his real name, not even his parents.\n\"I've actually considered legally even using George but I think out of respect to my parents and grandparents and generations before me, the importance of the name was given to me and out of respect for that, we'll keep it as is.\"\nAnd by George, that's how it will stay. \nCouncillor Wen-Hsiang Chu\nCoun. Sean Chu chose a name that sounds like part of his real name\n \n(Terri Trembath/CBC)\nSean Chu came to Canada in the 1980s from his native Taiwan.\nBut even before he arrived here, he said he was known as Sean.\nSoon after came to his new country, he recalls being at a barbecue with friends. \"The daughter said 'Hey, your nickname is Sean. So why don't you just use Sean. S-E-A-N.' And I said 'I like it.' So at that time, that was how the idea started.\"\nWhen he applied for his first Canadian passport, Chu said he needed an affidavit stating that he'd been using Sean for a number of years and the name was added to Wen-Hsiang Chu in his passport.\nEventually Sean became his first name and Wen-Hsiang his middle name.\nNow, he's just Sean Chu.\nHe said his mom still calls him Wen-Hsiang but he feels no need to revert to his real name.  \nSean is, \"who I am. Not changing it at all.\" \nCouncillor Prabhjote Gondek \nCoun. Jyoti Gondek goes by her nickname. \n \n(CBC)\nThe rookie councillor said it's important for her to use her full and legal name whenever she signs documents.\nBut Prabhjote Gondek says she's always been better known by a shorter version of her first name.\n\"Jyoti is the typical abbreviation for Prabhjote in Punjabi or Hindi. It's very much like William is Bill or Bob is short for Robert,\" said Gondek.\nAs for how that came about in her case, she said her parents started the habit but everyone has called her Jyoti since childhood.\n\"People who are of Indian origin get it because they're used to it. People who are not tend to struggle with it,\" she said.\n\"It's a little bit like being an Indo-Canadian if you will, I find Peggy to be a very strange abbreviation for Margaret. Yet most people who are exposed to that name get it.\"\nAnd if you're wondering about the meaning of Prabhjote, Gondek said it translates from Punjabi as \"a little flame\" or \"light from God.\"\n\"So when I light myself on fire in (council) chambers, now you know why!\" \nAll joking aside, she said that she hopes everyone known as Jyoti can, \"get a little exposure out of people like me getting into positions like this.\"\nCouncillor Eric Jones\nCoun. Ray Jones uses a shortened version of his middle name, just like his dad.\n \n(CBC)\nWho?\nThat's right. Even the longest-serving member of Calgary city council isn't known by his real name.\nTo most, he's Ray or perhaps even Rundle Ray, his home community in northeast Calgary. But his real name is Eric. \nAs for why he's been known as Ray all his life, it sounds like either his dad's to blame, or it's what has become a family tradition.\n\"My dad was Thomas Alfred and he went by Alf. Second names. My son is Randall Scott and he goes by Scott. We all go by our second name,\" said Jones.\n\"Except my girls. They go by their first names,\" he said smiling.\nJones signs documents using his full name (Eric Raymond Jones) and uses Eric in email accounts too.\nBut does actually anyone call him Eric?\n\"My doctor. Revenue Canada,\" he said laughing.\n\"Everyone calls me Ray.\"\nCouncillor Biagio Magliocca\n​\nWard 2 Coun. Joe Magliocca chose his name because it's easier for many to pronounce than his Italian first name. \n \n(Mike Symington/CBC)\nWhen he ran unsuccessfully for city council in 2007, his lawn signs said Biagio.\nBut in 2013 and 2017, the signs just said Joe. \n\"Biagio is really a true, traditional Italian name and there's a lot of Biagios in Italy,\" said Magliocca who readily and often talks about his family's heritage. \nBut how he came to be Joe isn't just a derivation of Biagio. \nMagliocca said many people couldn't say his first name. \"They'd say 'bee-ah-jo', 'badge-jo' and then they'd just call me 'joe' and I'd say 'Just call me Joe. That's my middle name. Just call me Joe.'\"\nHe said when he visits Toronto, family members all call him Biagio. But to friends, it's Joe. \nWhen he was growing up playing road hockey, one of the other kids on the street was a guy named Paul Coffey, who went on to become an all-star defenceman in the NHL.\n\"He used to call me Joe the Slasher,\" laughs Magliocca, who jokes he's moved on from shins to budgets.\nAny thoughts about going back to the real deal, Biagio?\nNope.\n\"I heard a lot of feedback from a lot of people [in the 2007 election], saying I can't even pronounce your name. How do you pronounce it?' And I said: Just call me Joe.\"\nMORE CALGARY NEWS | \nShe was a refugee — now this teen walks the runway for fashion world-heavy hitters\nMORE CALGARY NEWS | \nCalgary has run out of room to store all that snow", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The Lions scored 16 straight points to close the gap to 31-29 with 2:06 left in the game.\nB.C. got one final possession with 1:08 remaining but two incompletions, followed by a sack of Adams Jr., allowed the Riders to escape with the victory.\nJake Dolegala latest QB to lead Roughriders\nRoughriders ready for litmus test against B.C.

I mean, we had guys that were covering well, we had people in his face, and he was just throwing bullets,\" said Dickenson.\n\"So, credit to Vernon Adams, that was an outstanding game.

I think it's just Vernon, he was on a hot streak. He just looked outstanding. I thought our defence made a couple of mistakes, we obviously let some guys go in the secondary and we hope to correct that.\n\"But Vernon didn't miss the throw and we've got to give Vernon a lot of credit for that. He was hot and we were just trying to slow him down.\"\nDickenson added: \"The defence did answer the bell on the last possession and got the stop for us that allowed us to kick the field goal to go up by five points.

On B.C.'s second offensive play, Saskatchewan's Pete Robertson sacked Adams Jr., forcing a fumble that Anthony Lanier II recovered. The Riders took over on the B.C. 31-yard line and Dolegala quickly took advantage of the turnover.\nHe hit Samuel Emilus for 16 yards and followed up with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Kian Schaffer-Baker to give the Riders a 7-0 lead. The touchdown reception was the first of the season for Schaffer-Baker who was making his 2023 debut after off-season hip surgery.\nAfter Jamal Morrow scored on an eight-yard run at the 4:43 mark of the third quarter, Dolegala combined with rookie Jereth Sterns on an 18-yard touchdown pass to give the Riders a 21-10 lead with 3:10 left in the half.

B.C. defensive back Marcus Sayles appeared to be in position for an easy interception on the deep pass down the left sideline, but Emilus jumped above Sayles and grabbed the ball, rolling into the end zone for the major.\nDolegala admitted the pass was a 50-50 ball that he hoped Emilus could come down with.\n\"The halfback was coming over and I was like, `Screw it. I'll just put the ball up there.' Sam has got a 45-inch vertical leap and I know he's going to go up and get it,\" said Dolegala. \"The easiest thing to do is to just give them a shot and trust them that they're going to come down with it, and you saw that was Sam.\"\nEmilus, on the other hand, didn't consider the pass to be a 50-50 ball.\n\"For me, there's no 50-50 balls in the air. I've got to make the play. That's what I get paid for,\" said Emilus, who finished the game with five receptions for 106 yards and one touchdown.\nDickenson couldn't say enough about Emilus after the game.\n\"It was one of the best catches I've ever seen. I thought it was possibly an interception waiting to happen, but he just went up and over and somehow caught that thing at its highest point,\" said Dickenson.\n\"He got the game ball for the offence.

She decided to turn it back, away from the high-speed traffic.\n\"I grew up in farming country, so I am not at all afraid of animals.\"\nSeeing that the ox was still hornless, she guessed it was a two-year-old steer that had escaped from a nearby field.\nAngry bird dive-bombing passersby at Maison Radio-Canada\nWild turkey chases members, wreaks havoc at Île-Bizard golf course\nShe made a racket to scare the animal, but it wouldn't change its course.

And this time, the signs were ominous.\n\"It was scraping the ground with its hooves — it looked angry,\" Chouinard said. The ox charged full tilt and caught her squarely in the breastbone with its massive head.\nA swollen right arm is one of Laura Chouinard's battle scars from her encounter with the runaway ox.\n \n(Submitted by Laura Chouinard)\nThe impact knocked her down, but the beast was unsated. It thundered on toward her.\n\"Its hooves came within six inches of my eyes,\" Chouinard said.\nGripped by fear, she resolved, \"I am not going to die today.\"\nRolling with the punches\nGathering her wits, Chouinard took stock of her situation. She was hemmed in by tall snow banks and had little room to manoeuvre.\nThen, she remembered her karate training from 20 years ago. \"It's like swimming, you know. Even if you've not done it for a long time, you remember it quickly.\"\nThe scene of the \"crime\": Rustico Street North, to the left, is where the ox attacked Laura Chouinard.\n \n(Submitted by Laura Chouinard)\nHer martial arts moves helped Chouinard protect her vital organs. \"I had learnt how to defend my belly and my head. I presented my sides to the ox.\"\nThe ox kept pummelling her. It hit her some six or seven times.\nChouinard said calmly, \"I'm nearly 70 years old, but I'm in very good shape.\" Her extraordinary agility helped her roll away from the animal's deadly hooves every time it knocked her down.\nShaken, but not shattered\nDrawn by Chouinard's screams, a few drivers stopped to help. When their presence distracted the ox, she scrambled to safety up a snow bank.\nMeanwhile, the ox was briefly slowed in its tracks by a truck. But it soon went chasing after passersby, scattering them over the snowy countryside. It was finally subdued by the roar of a looming tractor that a neighbour drove over.\nThe snowbank that Laura Chouinard climbed to escape from the ox.\n \n(Submitted by Laura Chouinard)\n\"The whole thing lasted only two or three minutes,\" Chouinard said. \"But it seemed like a lot longer.\"\nAn onlooker drove a shaken Chouinard home and a friend called an ambulance.\nAt the hospital, doctors X-rayed her whole body and were relieved to find no broken bones. \"The only reason I was not badly hurt is that I am fit and strong,\" she concluded.\nHiding in a small hole, Lac Saint-Jean cyclist survives possible tornado\nAfter 25 years, Montreal Biodôme's oldest animals celebrate milestone birthday\nChouinard is phlegmatic about her ordeal and bears the beast no ill will.\n\"It was just being an energetic animal enjoying its freedom,\" she said with a laugh. \"Cattle escape from fields all the time.\"\nAlthough she doesn't blame him at all, the farmer who owns the ox was very apologetic and decided to sell off the offending animal.\nBruised all over and in considerable pain, Chouinard said gamely, \"I'll probably start running again next week. I was running four or five miles a day.

He gives the example of the case of Gabriel Sylliboy in the 1920s and the Marshall decision of 1999, which both reference the Peace and Friendship Treaties.\nSylliboy, who was Mi'kmaq, was convicted of hunting out of season after being found with muskrat pelts.

You can pre-register \nonline\n, over the \nphone or by emailing a form\n.\nOnce they have flight information to share with you, they'll send it to you at least 24 hours before the flight, along with information about ground transportation to the airport.\nYou can bring two bags under 50 pounds, and your pets.\nPeople who don't have ID, or who have expired IDs, will be allowed to travel on flights organized by the territory.\nFlight pre-registration opens for evacuated North Slave residents\nQ: For people who drove out but who don't have a ride back, are flights an option?\nYes. If you can't drive or catch a ride back, you can register for a flight. \nQ: Are people who paid for their own flights out eligible to take a government flight home?\nYes. Jay Boast, spokesperson for the territorial emergency management organization, said in an email that those people can also pre-register for government-offered flights. \nQ: What about people who ended up in smaller centres like Whitecourt?\nYou qualify for flights, but if you aren't staying in a so-called \"flight hub\", the territory's \nwebsite\n says you'll be responsible for getting yourself to the closest evacuation or reception centre. Once there, you'll be shuttled to the airport.\n On Saturday afternoon, James Fulford, incident commander with the Emergency Measures Organization, said they're working with Alberta to figure out where those hubs will be.

The Yellowknives Dene First Nation is also organizing buses to Dettah and Ndilǫ.\nBassi-Kellett said they are looking at the possibility of giving out taxi vouchers and providing ambulance support for people with mobility issues and they'll have more specifics available by the time flights roll around.\nQ: When will commercial airlines be cleared to start flying back into Yellowknife?\nJeffrey Edison, the acting assistant deputy minister with the Department of Infrastructure, said Saturday that the priority right now is government flights to get everybody home. Still, commercial operations will start coming back online Wednesday at noon when the evacuation order lifts.\nEdison said the department expects some commercial operations to be up and running that day, though services will be reduced.\nQ: What if I wasn't in Yellowknife when the evacuation occurred? S\nhould I plan to travel to an evacuation centre in Alberta to take a return charter flight, or wait for regularly scheduled flights to be reinstated?\nYou qualify for an N.W.T. re-entry flight, but you're responsible for getting yourself to an evacuation reception centre. Like other evacuees on the re-entry flights, after pre-registration, you will be assigned a flight and given at least 24 hours' notice of the details. \nDriving home\nQ: How will evacuees be supported on the drive home?\nOn Saturday afternoon, the territorial government said people returning by road will bear their own costs for accommodations, food and gas. The government's main support for people is \na one-time $750 payment\n that has been critiqued for leaving many residents out in the cold.\nThe government will have portable washrooms around Fort Providence, the Deh Cho Bridge, North Arm Park and the Rae access road. Gas, which you will need to pay for, is available at three locations around Fort Providence: the Big River Service Centre, the Northern Store and the Snowshoe Inn. Drivers are being encouraged to bring extra gas if they can, but the territory said emergency gas will also be available.\nThere will also be increased police presence in northern Alberta and along the return route to enforce traffic laws, but also to check in and offer help to stranded drivers.\nA blockade near Behchokǫ̀ on Highway 3.\n \n(Travis Burke/CBC)\nQ: What do evacuees need to bring back with them? \nYellowknife Mayor Rebecca Alty is asking people to bring non-perishable food items to last 72 hours, if they can, to ease the burden on grocery stores in Yellowknife that won't be fully staffed right away. \nQ: For those who can't drive the whole distance from Edmonton to Yellowknife in one day, how will overnight stops be handled?\nYou'll have to figure this out on your own.\nBoast said Saturday that there are limited places available for overnight stays in High Level and Grande Prairie, since many South Slave evacuees are still in those communities, so people should plan carefully.\nTravellers will be responsible for their own costs if they need to stay overnight.\nQ: How will northern Alberta towns handle this return home, in terms of fuel, accommodations and food?\nThe response to this one also involves planning your trip carefully. For High Level, Edison noted the Alberta government is ready for 7,000-plus vehicles to come through High Level, where many will be stopping for gas and food at the very least.\nHigh Level Mayor Crystal McAteer says businesses are preparing for swaths of travellers to continue coming through. She says that all of the town's 999 hotel rooms are booked but that there is an evacuation centre with 300 cots where evacuees can find respite.\n\"We'll just welcome them and provide them with some compassion and hope and comforts,\" McAteer said.\nFurther along the road, at the Big River Service Station outside Fort Providence, Edison said they've doubled the fuel capacity there, compared to what they had on-hand during the evacuation, so he isn't concerned about fuel.\nQ: What is in place to ensure a safe, orderly re-entry so long lines of vehicles aren't stuck on Highway 1?\nBoast said it's simply a reality that highways may close on short notice, given the wildfire situation. There could be some long delays, so check the highway conditions map as you go and know where you can stop for fuel or a rest.\nOne thing to take into account is that the Big River Service Station expects to be closed between midnight and 6 a.m.\nIf wildfires threaten highways, expect to run into delays at the border or at Steen River, according to Edison. The highway could be closed and barricaded. If that happens, highway workers will escort anyone who made it through before the closure to safety, while those who didn't make it in time will have to wait for the danger to pass.\nHighway workers will also be along the Deh Cho Bridge to direct and manage traffic flow, in an effort to help cut down on congestion. \nEvacuees leave Yellowknife in mid-August after an evacuation order.\n \n(Tyson Koschik/CBC)\nQ: For some of us relying on insurance, our coverage ends when the evacuation order lifts.

He said details on an extension after Sept. 8 will be shared in the coming days.\nHow did we get here so fast?\nQ: Which fire experts and territorial government departments were consulted prior to making the decision that Yellowknife was OK to return to?\nAt Saturday's press conference, Alty and city manager Sheila Bassi-Kellett said they've been working closely with the territorial government and the Yellowknives Dene First Nation on the re-entry plan.\nBassi-Kellett said one thing the city had sought clarity on is where the authority for the re-entry plan lay.\n\"MACA confirmed shortly after the evacuation that all aspects of the emergency, from planning to doing emergency response, these are the responsibility of the local government,\" she said.\n\"They ... made it clear that with advice from ECC and with their support, the timeline was up to the city as a local authority to determine.\"\nIn Depth\nConflicting information from officials fuels anxiety among those who fled N.W.T. wildfires\nN.W.T. adds eligibility criteria to evacuation travel support program\nQ: Why aren't they making people return in phases?\nTechnically, they are — it's just that one phase encompasses a vast amount of people.\nAlty said the city started bringing back staff for critical services when they entered the third phase of their re-entry plan. Flights for health care workers are also ongoing.\nOn Monday and Tuesday, before the evacuation order lifts for the general public, other critical staff will be returning by road.\nThe mass return after Wednesday also excludes people who have certain health conditions or needs, who will be brought back at a later date.\nQ: Why invite people back to Yellowknife before there has been time for health services to be set up beyond minimum?\nThe health system won't be back to full capacity for about a month, officials said Saturday.\nAlty said it's about balancing the urgency to get people home with being fully staffed.\nShe said, \"we can't wait a whole month for everything to get up and running and be perfect.\"\nQ: Why weren't dental services included in the list of essential health care services that were recalled?\nIn an email, the City of Yellowknife said it had to weigh several factors in deciding which services to bring back immediately, including which ones were critical. It said there are a lot of important services that just couldn't be deemed critical.\nIt said the emergency department at Stanton could treat \"acute dental conditions with basic medical interventions such as pain medications or antibiotics\" during the evacuation.\n\"Anyone needing to see a dentist for urgent care would need to make their own travel arrangements (or work with their employer if they were an essential employee) to make their way to a community with dental services available,\" the city wrote.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Those who lost loved ones say they are honouring their memories and working to make their First Nation safe.\nA morning of terror\nOn Sept. 4, 2022, 32-year-old Myles Sanderson unleashed uncontrollable violence on central Saskatchewan. Most of it happened in his own community of James Smith Cree Nation, which has some 3,400 members. About 1,900 of them live on reserve approximately 200 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon.\nEarly that morning, Sanderson and his brother, Damien Sanderson, were seen drinking excessively before breaking into a home in James Smith.\nSanderson attacked a man with scissors, but Damien broke it up. The brothers left, then got into a fight. \nDamien's body was found days later in a nearby bush.\nThe first 911 call came after the first attack at 5:40 a.m. Two RCMP officers arrived in the First Nation less than 40 minutes later.\nSanderson, however, was faster — swiftly moving from house to house, stabbing people in their own homes.\nEventually, he fled the First Nation in a stolen car and killed a man in the nearby village of Weldon, Sask.\nLeaders at James Smith Cree Nation voice concerns, hopes on anniversary of stabbings\nMyles Sanderson did all the killing in Sask. stabbing rampage, brother among victims: RCMP\nThen, less than three hours after his first attack, Sanderson disappeared. He evaded police for days, and the ensuing manhunt captivated the world.\nOn Sept. 7, RCMP spotted Sanderson in a stolen truck on a highway near Rosthern, Sask., about 130 kilometres southwest of James Smith. Officers chased him, forced his vehicle off the road into a ditch, and arrested him.\nShortly after, RCMP say Sanderson went into medical distress and died in police custody.\nThere would be no answers from the man who killed 11 people and hurt 17 others.\nEleven people were killed in the Sept. 4, 2022 stabbings.

And when he found it, rather than run out of bounds the rugged Kapp would lower his shoulder and try to run over or through a defensive player.\n\"Joe Kapp was tough as nails,\" CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said in a statement. \"While most quarterbacks tried to evade defenders, he would run over them.\n\"Kapp, in his playing days, epitomized a brash, young league making its mark in the sports world.\"\nKapp went to the NFL after the '66 season, playing for both Minnesota (1967-69) and the Boston Patriots (1970). Kapp signed with the Vikings in a deal that allowed Canadian receiver Jim Young, a future Canadian Football Hall of Famer, to join the Lions.\nKapp led the Vikings to the Super Bowl in 1969 where they lost 23-7 to the Kansas City Chiefs.\nKapp, Mosca regretting CFL luncheon brawl\nCFL greats' fight 'most bizarre thing'\nThe Vikings GM at the time was none other than Jim Finks, who had brought Kapp to Canada with the Calgary Stampeders. Minnesota's head coach was the late Bud Grant, the former Winnipeg Blue Bombers head coach whose teams had faced Kapp in Canada.\nKapp, a two-time CFL all-star, is the only quarterback to play in the Rose Bowl, Grey Cup and Super Bowl.\nKapp was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1984 and named to the U.S. college football Hall of Fame in 2004. Kapp is also a member of the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and B.C. Lions Wall of Fame.\nHis No. 22 has been retired by the Lions.\nKapp played his collegiate football at the University of California, Berkeley, leading the school to a Pacific Coast championship in 1958. On Jan. 1, 1959, the Golden Bears lost a 38-12 decision to Iowa in the Rose Bowl.\nDidn't hear from Washington\nKapp was a two-sport star at Cal. He also played basketball on the school's Pacific Coast Conference championship teams (1956-57, 1957-58).\nWashington selected Kapp in the 18th round of the 1959 NFL draft. But after the franchise failed to contact Kapp, he accepted an offer from Finks, then the Stampeders GM.\nKapp spent two seasons in Calgary before being dealt to the B.C. Lions. The move came after Kapp suffered a bad knee injury early during the 1960 season but didn't miss any games as he played with it heavily taped.\nKapp led B.C. to a 12-4 record and top spot in the West Division standings in 1963. The Lions dispatched the Saskatchewan Roughriders in the conference final to advance to the Grey Cup game versus the Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Vancouver's Empire Stadium.\nHamilton won 21-10 but the game is remembered for Mosca's controversial blow on Lions running back Willie Fleming. Mosca's sideline hit on Fleming while Fleming was on the ground touched off a long-standing feud between players on both teams.\nTiger-Cats legend Angelo Mosca dies at 84 after lengthy battle with Alzheimer's\nThe Lions avenged the Grey Cup loss the following season. After posting a stellar 11-2-3 record, B.C., dispatched Hamilton 36-24 in the Grey Cup game, the first title in franchise history.\nBut the bad blood never dissipated. In 2011, Kapp and Mosca had a physical altercation during a CFL Alumni Association luncheon in Vancouver.\nVideo of Kapp shoving flowers in Mosca's face, Mosca retaliating by swinging his cane at Kapp, who then punched Mosca, knocking him to the floor grabbed global attention.\nWATCH | Longtime CFL rivals come to blows years later:\nCFL greats duke it out\n12 years ago\nDuration \n4:06\nComedian Ron James recalls the odd dust-up that happened at a CFL luncheon he was hosting for league legends in Vancouver\nKapp left for the NFL following the 1966 season. But he returned to B.C. in 1990 as the club's general manager. While Kapp was responsible for recruiting former NFL star Mark Gastineau (who was a flop in the CFL), he did sign Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Doug Flutie.\nMore CFL coverage\nMore NFL coverage\nFlutie spent eight illustrious seasons in Canada (1990-97) with B.C., the Calgary Stampeders and Toronto Argonauts before joining the Buffalo Bills in 1998. The former Boston College star was the CFL's outstanding player an unprecedented six times and was a three-time Grey Cup champion.\nFlutie was voted as the CFL's top player all-time in a TSN poll in 2006 and two years later was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. Flutie is also a member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\nBefore serving as a Lions executive, Kapp coached at his alma mater (1982-86), posting a 20-34-1 record. The Golden Bears had a 7-4 mark in Kapp's first season, which included an improbable 25-20 victory over rival Stanford on a game-ending kickoff return TD dubbed \"The Play.\" It featured five separate laterals and the touchdown was scored with the Cardinal marching band on the field.\nKapp also worked as an actor in the 1970s-'80s, appearing in such TV programs as Ironside, The Six Million Dollar Man, Adam-12 and Police Woman. He also had roles in such movies as The Longest Yard, Semi-Tough, Breakheart Pass and The Frisco Kid.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He never missed a game, playing in 118 straight before his sudden retirement in 1965 — after being named Most Valuable Player.\nBrown led the Browns to their last championship in 1964 before quitting football in his prime at age 30 to make movies. He appeared in more than 30 films, including \"Any Given Sunday\" and \"The Dirty Dozen.\"\nA powerful runner with speed and endurance, Brown's arrival sparked the game's burgeoning popularity on television and he remained an indomitable figure well after his playing days ended.\nBrown was also a champion for Black Americans and used his platform and voice to fight for equality.\n\"I hope every Black athlete takes the time to educate themselves about this incredible man and what he did to change all of our lives,\" NBA star LeBron James said. \"We all stand on your shoulders Jim Brown. If you grew up in Northeast Ohio and were Black, Jim Brown was a God.\"\nAlthough it’s been 58 years since Jim Brown played his final NFL game, his reputation as one of the most dynamic players to ever step on a football field transcends generations. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HOFForever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HOFForever</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/VqAlyr8J1s\">pic.twitter.com/VqAlyr8J1s</a>\n&mdash;\n@ProFootballHOF\nIn June 1967, Brown organized \"The Cleveland Summit,\" a meeting of the nation's top Black athletes, including Bill Russell and Lew Alcindor, who later became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, to support boxer Muhammad Ali's fight against serving in Vietnam.\nIn later years, he worked to curb gang violence in LA and in 1988 founded Amer-I-Can, a program to help disadvantaged inner-city youth and ex-convicts.\nOn the field, there was no one like Brown, who would blast through would-be tacklers, refusing to let one man take him down before sprinting away from linebackers and defensive backs. He was also famous for using a stiff arm to shed defenders in the open field or push them away like they were rag dolls.\nIncomparable on the field\nIndeed, Brown was unlike any back before him, and some feel there has never been anyone better than Cleveland's No. 32. At six-foot-two, 230 pounds, he was relentless, fighting for every yard, dragging multiple defenders along or finding holes where none seemed to exist.\nAfter Brown was tackled, he'd slowly rise and walk even more slowly back to the huddle — then dominate the defense when he got the ball again.\nA three-time NFL MVP and league champion with the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Browns?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Browns</a> in 1964, Jim Brown was a force on the football field that provided lifelong memories to whomever had the privilege of watching him play. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HOFForever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HOFForever</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Kst5J2UWug\">pic.twitter.com/Kst5J2UWug</a>\n&mdash;\n@ProFootballHOF\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell offered his condolences on behalf of the league.\n\"Jim Brown was a gifted athlete — one of the most dominant players to ever step on any athletic field — but also a cultural figure who helped promote change,\" Goodell said. \"During his nine-year NFL career, which coincided with the civil rights movement here at home, he became a forerunner and role model for athletes being involved in social initiatives outside their sport.\"\nOff the field, Brown was a contentious, complicated figure.\nWhile he had a soft spot for those in need, he also was arrested a half-dozen times, mostly on charges of hitting women.\nIn June 1999, Brown's wife called 911, saying Brown had smashed her car with a shovel and threatened to kill her. During the trial, Monique Brown recanted. Jim Brown was acquitted of a charge of domestic threats but convicted of misdemeanor vandalism. A Los Angeles judge sentenced Brown to six months in jail when he refused to attend domestic violence counselling.\nHe also feuded with Browns coach Paul Brown and later with the team's management, although he played his entire career with Cleveland.\nLengthy acting career\nWhen his playing days ended, Brown set off for Hollywood and eventually settled there. Brown advised Cleveland coach Blanton Collier of his retirement while the team was in training camp and he was on the set of \"The Dirty Dozen\" in England.\nAmong his films were \"100 Rifles,\" \"Mars Attacks!\" Spike Lee's \"He Got Game,\" Oliver Stone's \"Any Given Sunday,\" and \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,\" which parodied the blaxploitation genre. In 2002, Brown was the subject of Lee's HBO documentary \"Jim Brown: All-American.\"\nIn recent years, Brown's relationship with the Browns was inconsistent. He served as an adviser to owner Randy Lerner and was hired to counsel the team's younger players. However, in 2010, Brown parted ways with the team after having his role reduced by incoming team president Mike Holmgren. Brown felt slighted by the perceived demotion — when the club unveiled a \"Ring of Honor\" inside its downtown stadium, Brown didn't attend the ceremony in protest.\nThe Browns erected a statue of Brown outside their stadium in 2016.\nJim Brown Forever 🧡🤎♾️<br><br>Legend.

In February, he attended the NFL Honors ceremony when the league announced it had renamed its league rushing title as The Jim Brown Award.\nBrown was an eight-time All-Pro and went to the Pro Bowl in each of his nine years in the league. When he retired, he held the league's records for yards (12,312) and touchdowns (126).\n\"He told me, `Make sure when anyone tackles you he remembers how much it hurts,\"' said Hall of Fame tight end John Mackey. \"He lived by that philosophy and I always followed that advice.\"\nBorn on Feb. 17, 1936, in St. Simons Island, Georgia, Brown was a multisport star at Manhasset High School on Long Island. He averaged 14.9 yards per carry in football and once scored 55 points in a game.\nA two-sport star at Syracuse — some say he is the best lacrosse player in NCAA history — Brown endured countless racist taunts while playing at the virtually all-white school at the time. Still, he was an All-American in both sports and lettered in basketball.\n'Jim Brown is the best'\nBrown was the sixth overall pick of the 1957 draft, joining a team that routinely played for the title. He was the Offensive Rookie of the Year that season.\nRunning behind an offensive line featuring Hall of Fame tackles Lou Groza and Mike McCormack, Brown set a league mark with 1,527 yards and scored 17 TDs on his way to the league's Most Outstanding Player award — a precursor to the MVP — in 1958. Over the next three seasons, he never ran for less than 1,257 yards before finishing with 996 in 1962.\nHe led the NFL in rushing eight times, gaining a career-best 1,863 yards in 1963. He averaged 104 yards per game, scored 106 rushing touchdowns and averaged an astounding 5.2 yards per carry. A dangerous receiver as well, Brown finished with 262 catches for 2,499 yards and another 20 TDs.\n\"I've said many times, and I will always say, Jim Brown is the best,\" Hall of Fame running back Gale Sayers once said, \"and he will still be the best long after all his records are broken.\"\nNumber retired in Cleveland\nBrown's No. 32 was retired by the Browns in '71, the same year he entered the Hall of Fame. But he rarely visited Cleveland during the 1970s and '80s. He and Cleveland owner Art Modell were at odds over his sudden retirement; the two later patched up their differences and remained friends.\nBrown supported Modell's decision to move Cleveland's franchise to Baltimore in 1995. It was both a reflection of his loyalty to Modell and another sign of his fierce independence. Brown was one of the few former Browns players not angry with Modell for moving the team.\nMany modern players couldn't appreciate Brown or his impact on American sports.\n\"They have grown up in a different era,\" former Browns coach Romeo Crennel said. \"He's one of the greatest players in NFL history and what he was able to accomplish in his time was tremendous. I don't know that anybody could do what he did, the way he did it, under the circumstances that he had to operate and the things that he had to endure.\n\"And for him to go out on top, that's something that not many guys are able to appreciate either.\"\nBrown is survived by his wife and son, Aris; daughter, Morgan, son, Jim Jr.; daughter, Kimberly; son, Kevin; daughter, Shellee; and daughter, Kim.

Harris, like Snyder and Commissioner Roger Goodell, grew up in the Washington metro area as an avid fan of the team.\n\"He has a remarkable business record, not just in finance but also now in sports, and I think he's a person who cares deeply about not just his assets but at least more importantly his communities,\" Goodell said.\nCommanders' Dan Snyder fined $60M US for sexually harassing employee, financial improprieties\nThe sale was expected to close in the coming days and thus finalize an ugly two-plus decades for one of the NFL's oldest franchises. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones beamed in a brief interview with reporters on his way into the meeting.\n\"It's a hallmark day,\" Jones said. \"I'm excited about the prospects of going into Washington and giving them some capital punishment.\"\nOwners also received an in-person summary from former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White on her investigation for the NFL into the Commanders that was launched 1 1/2 years ago launched in light of the congressional review into workplace misconduct that also included a referral to the Federal Trade Commission for potential business improprieties by Snyder.\nThe probe corroborated an allegation that Snyder sexually harassed a former team employee who first brought that account forward in front of a House committee.\nWhite's report also confirmed that team executives under Snyder's supervision deliberately withheld millions of dollars in revenue from other clubs.\nSnyder had owned his favourite boyhood team since 1999, when he bought it for $800 million. Success was fleeting, both on and off the field. With Snyder in charge, the team made the playoffs just six times in 24 years, only twice won a postseason game and went 166-226-2 overall. The franchise has lost a significant amount of lustre from the glory days under coach Joe Gibbs, who won three Super Bowls in his 12-year run from 1981-92.\nHouse report: Dan Snyder had role in 'toxic' Commanders culture\nMagic Johnson joins Josh Harris' bid to buy NFL's Washington Commanders: report\nThen there were the problems outside of football, from a feud with minority owners that led Snyder to buy out their shares of the team to allegations of sexual harassment by former employees, which prompted a series of investigations into workplace misconduct. Over and over again, Snyder said he would never sell the team.\nThe tide began to shift on that front last October when Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said there was \"merit to remove\" Snyder, an ouster that would have required votes from at least 24 of the other 31 clubs. Two weeks later, Snyder and his wife Tanya hired a firm to begin exploring a sale of part or all of one of the NFL's oldest franchises — one that has called the nation's capital home since 1937.\nUltimately, that process led to a group chaired by Harris. His investment crew also includes David Blitzer, with whom he co-owns the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers and the NHL's New Jersey Devils, Washington-area businessman Mitchell Rales and more than a dozen others. The unusually large ownership group needed and received league finance approval for a deal that shattered the $4.35 billion Walmart heir Rob Walton paid last year for the Denver Broncos.\nThe special meeting for the Commanders sale was conducted at the same hotel adjacent to the Mall of America in suburban Minneapolis where Walton's group gained formal control of the Broncos. Johnson raved about the approval of the sale on Twitter — \"truly the biggest achievement in my business career,\" he tweeted — shortly before Harris posed for photos with a Commanders helmet and accepted well wishes from Goodell and others.\n\"They want to put that franchise where they believe it belongs, where it's respected not just in the community but worldwide,\" Goodell said. \"They're committed to that.\"\nImmediate challenge to build new stadium\nTheir biggest immediate challenge for the long-term future of the organization is a new stadium to replace FedEx Field, the rushed-to-completion home of the team since 1997 in Landover, Maryland, that has not aged well. Virginia abandoned a stadium bill more than a year ago, a consequence of the number of off-field controversies swirling around the team. The site of RFK Stadium, the club's previous home in the capitol city, has significant backing as the place for the new venue.\n\"It's going to take awhile to unpack what really makes sense,\" Harris said. \"As far as RFK, I understand it's the spiritual home of the history of the Commanders.\nBringing the fans back is a major priority after Washington ranked last in the league in attendance in 2022 and second-to-last in 2021. The team rebranded last year as the Commanders after dropping the name Redskins in 2020 and generically going by the Washington Football Team for two seasons.\n\"I've had many sleepless nights, and I will have many sleepless nights. I'm going to sweat this,\" Harris said. \"I feel an awesome responsibility to the city of Washington. I know what I've got to give.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The fine represents 1 per cent of the sale price; Snyder bought the team, then known as the Redskins, for $800 million.\nNFL owners unanimously approve record sale of Commanders to Josh Harris\nThe investigation was led by former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Mary Jo White and conducted by her law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton. The league had pledged to make the findings of the probe public.\nInvestigators concluded that Washington withheld $11 million in revenue that should have been shared with other teams, an amount the report suggests may have been far greater. White's firm was unable to reach a conclusion about tens of millions of additional dollars that may have been withheld in part because Snyder and the team did not cooperate fully with the investigation, according to the report.\nThe report concluded that Snyder sexually harassed former team employee Tiffani Johnston, allegations that Johnston first made last year in front of a House committee. Snyder placed his hand on Johnston's thigh at a team dinner and pushed her toward his car as they were leaving the restaurant, the report said.\n\"The findings do speak for themselves. In both cases, it's inappropriate, it's wrong, it doesn't match our values,\" Commissioner Roger Goodell said at a news conference in Minnesota after NFL owners voted.\nHouse report: Dan Snyder had role in 'toxic' Commanders culture\nMagic Johnson joins Josh Harris' bid to buy NFL's Washington Commanders: report\nSnyder has denied Johnston's allegations and repeated that denial in an interview with White's investigators. He only agreed to speak with investigators for one hour, the report said.\nInvestigators spoke with Johnston several times and \"found her to be highly credible,\" the report said, and her account was corroborated by witnesses and other evidence. The investigation also substantiated claims by another former employee, Jason Friedman, who told the House about financial improprieties.\n\"Dan Snyder has been forced to sell the team he said he would never sell, pay a massive fine to the NFL and there now exists an extensive public record of his personal wrongdoing and the misconduct that occurred under his leadership,\" attorneys Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, who represent Johnston and Friedman, said in a statement. \"We are proud of our clients' courage in coming forward publicly and working tirelessly to hold Mr. Snyder accountable.\"\nThe report also concluded that a former team executive improperly took possession of a photograph of Johnston from a calendar shoot of the team's cheerleaders. Johnston was wearing lingerie in the photo, which had not been edited \"to fully cover inadvertent exposures.\" Investigators found insufficient evidence to show Snyder was personally involved in that incident.\n'Every dollar matters'\nWhite's firm did not conclude whether Snyder was personally aware of the financial misdeeds, but witnesses told investigators that Snyder repeatedly pressured team employees to improve its financial performance, telling them, \"every dollar matters.\" Documents detailing how the team moved revenue into accounts that shielded the money from other teams were shared with Snyder on at least one occasion, the report said.\n\"At a minimum, [Snyder] was aware of certain efforts to minimize revenue sharing, at least some of which were later found to be in violation of the NFL rules,\" the report said.\nRep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House's oversight committee, said White's findings contradicted Snyder's sworn testimony and introduced two bills intended to protect American workers from the abuses committed by Snyder and the Commanders.\nIn order to skirt NFL revenue-sharing rules, Washington would classify team-related revenue as money made from special events such as concerts, college football games or soccer games.\n\"[I]f the NFL had a jail ... we would be in it,\" a team employee wrote to its chief financial officer in 2010 after agreeing to allocate NFL revenue to a college game.\nMore NFL coverage\nFriedman alleged that the Commanders had \"a second set of books,\" and the investigation corroborated his account. Among its findings were that millions of dollars in revenue from \"tickets sold or bartered with sponsors at falsely undervalued prices\" were moved into accounts that hid the money from the league.\nIn addition to the $11 million that White's firm found the team withheld from the league, forensic accountants who reviewed the team's books identified another $44 million in parking, license and other revenues that were transferred from accounts holding league revenue into special events accounts.\nThe report notes that the team's revenue-shielding scheme \"appear[s] to have become more aggressive after its ticket sales began deteriorating in 2008.\" Washington had long touted a decades-long waiting list for season tickets, but demand cratered under Snyder's stewardship of the team, which went 166-226-2 overall and won only two playoff games during his 24 years as owner.\nSnyder long had a reputation for squeezing every possible dollar out of fans, from aggressive pricing of parking and concessions to charging fans to attend training camp. He even filed lawsuits against fans for cancelling their season tickets. The District of Columbia Attorney General's office reached a settlement with Snyder over the team's failure to return season-ticket security deposits.\nWhite's firm wrote that while Snyder and the team pledged to fully cooperate with investigators, they did not. Instead, the Commanders failed to produce requested documents, declined to let investigators speak to the team's external auditors, and engaged in other tactics that \"delayed and impeded the investigation.\"\n\"Evidencing his individual failure to cooperate, Mr. Snyder engaged in months of scheduling, cancelling, and rescheduling of his interview,\" the report said.\n ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Fishman said Oher mentioned the Tuohys being conservators for him three times in \nI Beat The Odds: From Homeless, To The Blind Side\n, Oher's first book in 2011.\nEx-NFLer Michael Oher, known for movie The Blind Side, alleges adoption was a lie\nThe couple's attorneys also said that the Tuohys and Oher have been estranged for about a decade.

In a statement released by their lawyers Tuesday, the Tuohys said Oher had threatened before the court filing to plant a negative news story about them unless they paid him $15 million US, calling it a \"shakedown.\"\nWATCH | Blind Side story turns ugly as Oher sues family that took him in:\n \nBlind Side story turns ugly as NFL star sues Tennessee family that took him in\n23 days ago\nDuration \n2:12\nThe pro football player whose life story inspired the 2009 Oscar-winning Sandra Bullock blockbuster The Blind Side is suing Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, claiming they never formally adopted him. NFL star Michael Oher alleges the Tuohys duped him out of millions of dollars by tricking him into making them his conservators, allowing them to do business deals in his name.\nOher's lawyers did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\nThe conservatorship paperwork was filed months after Oher turned 18 in May 2004. Oher accuses the Tuohys of never taking legal action to assume custody from the Tennessee Department of Human Services before he turned 18, though he was told to call them \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\"\nOher alleges the Tuohys had him sign paperwork almost immediately after he moved in as part of the adoption process. Oher says he was \"falsely advised\" that it would be called a conservatorship because he was already 18, but that adoption was the intent.\nThe couple didn't simply adopt Oher, Fishman said, because the conservatorship was the fastest way to satisfy the NCAA's concerns that the Tuohys weren't simply steering a talented athlete to Mississippi, their alma mater where Oher later attended.\nOher, who has never been a fan of the movie about his life, asks that the Tuohys be sanctioned and required by the probate court to pay damages. He asks to be paid what he is due, along with interest.\nAgents negotiated a small advance for the Tuohys from the production company for \nThe Blind Side\n, based on a book written by Sean Tuohy's friend Michael Lewis, the couple said. That included \"a tiny percentage of net profits\" divided equally among a group that included Oher, they said in their statement.\n'They don't need his money'\nThe attorneys said they estimated each of the Tuohys and Oher received $100,000 apiece, and the couple paid taxes on Oher's portion for him. \"Michael got every dime, every dime he had coming,\" Fishman said.\n\"They don't need his money,\" Farese said. \"They've never needed his money.

The movie won Sandra Bullock an Oscar for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy.\nWhen Oher refused to cash the checks, the statement said, the Tuohys deposited Oher's share into a trust account.\nThe Tuohys said that they set up the conservatorship to help Oher with health insurance, a driver's license and being admitted to college. In Tennessee, a conservatorship removes power from a person to make decisions for themselves, and it is often used in the case of a medical condition or disability.\nBut Oher's conservatorship was approved \"despite the fact that he was over 18 years old and had no diagnosed physical or psychological disabilities,\" his petition said.\nOher was the 23rd overall pick in the 2009 draft out of Mississippi, and he spent his first five seasons with the Baltimore Ravens where he won a Super Bowl. He played 110 games over eight NFL seasons, including 2014 when he started 11 games for the Tennessee Titans.

His fellow alum is still mad about it\nThe bright yellow billboards loom over Los Angeles's major freeways. The message, in capitalized red and black lettering, is clear: \"Hey NCAA ... give Reggie Bush back his Heisman!\"\nBrian Kennedy, the owner of Regency Outdoor Advertising and a University of Southern California (USC) alumnus, plastered dozens of signs declaring his demand across the city months ago, in an effort to right a wrong he sees in college football history.\nFormer National Football League and USC running back Reggie Bush, who won the coveted Heisman Memorial Trophy in 2005, later gave up the award when the NCAA found he and his family accepted cash and gifts from marketing agents. Every year, the trophy is awarded to the sport's most outstanding player at the college level. \nAt the time of Bush's win, the NCAA didn't allow players to profit off of their name, image or likeness. His Heisman was never reinstated, despite a change to the NCAA's likeness-profiting rules in 2021.\nGet the news you need without restrictions. Download the free \nCBC News App\n or \nCBC Listen app\n.\nKennedy says he's received about 150 phone calls since putting up the billboards a few months ago, most of which were supportive.\n\"It created quite a stir,\" he told \nAs It Happens\n guest host Peter Armstrong.\nKennedy says Bush himself called and to offer his thanks over the phone and got quite emotional.\n\"I've seen all of [the billboards],\" said Bush in an \ninterview\n with USCFootball.com. \n\"I didn't create the situation, the NCAA created the situation. The fact that billboards have to get put up … that's on them,\" said.\nAS IT HAPPENS\n'It's a pretty weird thing to do,' says man vying for CFL stadium visit world record\nReggie Bush forfeits Heisman Trophy\nWhy Bush lost the Heisman\nA year after Bush won the Heisman, reports that he and his family accepted gifts and the payment of travel expenses surfaced. His parents were also given a house to live in rent-free, and money to furnish it, according to \nmedia reports\n.\nAn investigation by the NCAA that concluded in 2010 found the reports to be true. At the time, the organization's rules barred athletes from receiving any kind of compensation for their name, image or likeness.\nBush voluntarily forfeited the trophy in 2010 when the NCAA placed \nheavy sanctions\n on his alma mater over the improper benefits he received.\nThe NCAA vacated the player's records as a result, and USC banned him from officially interacting with the school for 10 years, which \nlasted until 2020\n.\nBush played 11 years in the NFL, winning the Super Bowl in 2010 with the New Orleans Saints.\n \n(Winslow Townson/Getty Images)\nNCAA rules now changed\nA year later in 2021, the NCAA adopted an interim name, image and likeness policy that allowed student-athletes to receive endorsements and social media deals, as well as accept money for coaching, public appearances and signing autographs. \nIn his interview with USCFootball.com, Bush criticized how the NCAA \"restrict[ed] athletes, not allowing players to monetize … their own name, image and likeness while universities and the NCAA make billions of dollars.\"\n\"I'm glad the [players] are making money now. I think players deserve a piece of that pie.\"\nBush has said he's \nasked\n for the Heisman to be returned to him, but \nThe Heisman Trust has publicly said\n they'd only reinstate the trophy if USC restored his records, which were vacated after their 2010 investigation.\nHeisman Trophy for 2005 will remain vacant\nUSC QB Caleb Williams wins Heisman Trophy after leading Trojan turnaround\n\"College athletes can receive benefits now from their name, image and likeness through activities like endorsements and appearances. However, NCAA rules still do not permit pay for play type arrangements. The NCAA infractions process exists to promote fairness in college sports,\" the NCAA told the CBC in an emailed statement.\nStill, Kennedy says the the decision is too harsh, especially considering Bush gave up the trophy voluntarily. \nDespite having to give up one of the most prestigious trophies in American sports, Bush went on to play 11 seasons in the NFL, winning the Super Bowl in 2010 with the New Orleans Saints. Since retiring, he's joined Fox Sports as a college football analyst.\nKennedy says his success is a testament to the kind of player and athlete he is. Still, Kennedy adds the well-publicized scandal didn't help Bush.\n\"You don't shut people out like that,\" Kennedy said.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

He also asks to be paid what he is due, with interest.\nHe accuses the Tuohys of enriching themselves at his expense by continuing to \"falsely and publicly\" represent themselves as his adoptive parents \"to the date of the filing of this petition.\"\n\"Oher discovered this lie to his chagrin and embarrassment in February of 2023, when he learned that the conservatorship to which he consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member of the Tuohy family, in fact provided him no familial relationship with the Tuohys,\" according to the petition.\nOher, who says he has never been a fan of the movie of his life, also asks in the petition that the Tuohys be sanctioned and required to pay both compensatory and punitive damages determined by the court.\nESPN.com first reported the petition.\nTuhoys to answer in court\nSteve Farese, a lawyer for the Tuohys, told The Associated Press they will file an answer to the allegations in court but declined to comment further.

Oher says he was \"falsely advised\" that it would be called a conservatorship because he was already 18, but the intent was adoption.\n\"At no point did the Tuohys inform Michael that they would have ultimate control of all his contracts, and as a result Michael did not understand that if the conservatorship was granted, he was signing away his right to contract for himself,\" according to the petition.\nA book based on Oher's life, \nThe Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,\n was released in September 2006, written by Michael Lewis, who is described in the petition as a childhood friend of Sean Tuohy's. The petition alleges his conservators began contract negotiations for movie rights.\nThe petition alleges a deal was reached to pay the Tuohys, plus children Sean Jr. and Collins, $225,000 US plus 2.5 per cent of future defined net proceeds hinging on Oher's signature. A contract titled \"Life Story Rights Agreement\" was \"purportedly signed by Michael Oher\" and dated April 20, 2007, according to the petition.\nThe petition says Oher believes the signature is similar to his own but that he \"at no time ever willingly or knowingly signed this document and that nobody ever presented this contract to him with any explanation that he was signing such a document.\"\nIn the petition, Oher asks for a full accounting of his assets and how they were used, considering his life story produced millions of dollars and he received nothing for the rights to something that would not have existed without him.\nLast played in NFL in 2016\nOher was the 23rd overall pick in the 2009 draft out of Mississippi, and he spent his first five seasons with the Baltimore Ravens. He wound up playing eight NFL seasons, including 2014 when he started 11 games for the Tennessee Titans.

Darnold ended up doing enough in practices and the first two preseason games to beat out Lance.\nLance has completed 56 of 102 passes in his brief NFL career for 797 yards, five TDs, three interceptions and an 84.5 passer rating. He also has rushed for 235 yards and one TD on 54 carries.\n\"I can tell everybody it wasn't for a lack of effort on Trey's part or on our part,\" Lynch said. \"Circumstances took hold and he struggled through injuries.

Cincinnati finished 12-4 last year, with Burrow setting franchise single-season records for completions, pass attempts and passing touchdowns.\nBurrow had season-ending knee surgery in 2020, his rookie year. He immediately became one of the NFL's best passers upon his return. The notoriously frugal Bengals had not reached a Super Bowl since 1998 or even recorded a playoff win since 1990.\nBurrow strained a calf muscle early in this summer's training camp and was out of action until last week. He said Wednesday he's on track to start against the Browns on Sunday.\nThe market for quarterbacks was set for Burrow in late July when Los Angeles Chargers QB Justin Herbert agreed to a five-year, $262.5 million extension.\nHerbert's total value and $52.5 million average per season surpassed the $260 million, five-year extension ($52 million average) that Baltimore's Lamar Jackson signed in April.

For instance, a record five Canadians were picked in this year's draft after four were taken in 2021.\nAs the 2023 season kicks off tonight with the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs hosting the up-and-coming Detroit Lions, here are five Canadian NFL players to keep an eye on:\nChase Claypool, receiver, Chicago Bears\nThe second-round pick out of Notre Dame dazzled as a rookie for the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2020, when he scored four touchdowns in a single game and finished the season with 11 TDs and 62 receptions for 873 yards. But Claypool's TD total fell to two in 2021 as he found himself in coach Mike Tomlin's doghouse, and he remained stuck in neutral last year when Pittsburgh traded him to the rebuilding Bears.\nThe Windy City isn't exactly a receiver's haven with run-happy quarterback Justin Fields at the helm. And Claypool finds himself lower on the depth chart this year after the Bears traded for D.J. Moore to be their new No. 1 receiver. But that move could help elevate Fields' shaky passing and lift Chicago out of the basement after it went a league-worst 3-14 last year.\nJevon Holland, safety, Miami Dolphins\nThe Dolphins, one of the fastest teams in the NFL, feature flashy playmakers like star receivers Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle and newly acquired cornerback Jalen Ramsey (out until December with a knee injury). But the secret star of the Miami defence is Holland, a 2021 second-round pick who led the team with two interceptions last year while quietly becoming one of the better safeties in the league.\nHolland might earn wider acclaim (and his first Pro Bowl selection) if Miami makes a run at the Super Bowl. But that will hinge on the fragile health of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, whose 2022 season was cut short by multiple scary concussions.\nChuba Hubbard, running back, Carolina Panthers\nA former 2,000-yard rusher for Oklahoma State, the 2021 fourth-round pick spent much of his first two pro seasons as a backup to superstar Christian McCaffrey. Hubbard showed some juice as both a runner and pass-catcher when McCaffrey was hurt in 2021 and after the Pro Bowler was traded to San Francisco last year. But the Panthers still went out and signed former Eagle Miles Sanders to be their new feature back.\nIt's a transition year in Carolina, where No. 1 overall draft pick Bryce Young is taking over at quarterback with Frank Reich as the new head coach. If Sanders disappoints or gets injured (he's been known to do both), Hubbard will have a chance to show that he should be part of the team's future.\nJohn Metchie III, receiver, Houston Texans\nThe NFL's Comeback Player of the Year award will almost certainly go to Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who's miraculously set to play in Buffalo's opener against the Jets on Monday night after nearly dying on the field from cardiac arrest eight months ago. But Metchie could be a candidate too after missing his entire rookie season after being diagnosed with leukemia.\nThough he's only 23, Metchie is already no stranger to comebacks. He led perennial college power Alabama with 96 catches in 2021 before blowing out his knee in the SEC title game. Houston drafted him in the second round anyway, and now he'll finally get a chance to prove himself on a rebuilding team that's breaking in No. 2 overall pick C. J. Stroud at quarterback.\nJosh Palmer, receiver, Los Angeles Chargers\nLast season, the 2021 third-round choice was targeted 107 times (more than double his rookie-year total) as star wideouts Keenan Allen and Mike Williams missed time with injuries. Palmer converted those targets into a solid 72 catches for 769 yards and three touchdowns. But L.A. still picked Quentin Johnston in the first round in hopes of upgrading to a more explosive No. 3 receiver.\nThe Chargers always seem to fall short of expectations, but they have an MVP-calibre quarterback in Justin Herbert and a lot of talent on both sides of the ball. If new offensive co-ordinator Kellen Moore (formerly of the Cowboys) can unlock this team's enormous scoring potential, Palmer could find himself playing in a Super Bowl.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

I know there was a football game going out there today, but I mean a truly remarkable display of courage and strength and faith.\"\nHamlin arrived at the stadium flashing his familiar heart sign and held out three fingers to signify his jersey number as he entered the tunnel.

And he spent the second half watching along the sideline with his pads on while wearing running shoes.\nAt the final whistle, Hamlin sought out his mother, Nina, in the stands and presented her his game jersey even though he had initially promised it to former teammate and now Colts receiver Isiah McKenzie.\n\"That first jersey back, it had to go to Mom. Dude, I had to go to her. My mom was my strength, my everything, you know, through my entire life,\" Hamlin said. \"But I'm for surely going to get Isaiah a jersey this season.\"\nMcKenzie is fine with having to wait.\nMore important to him was seeing how far Hamlin has come.\n\"It was awesome to see him progressing the way he's progressing.

The team's forward, Alex Wennberg, quickly became popular with BookTok users and became a viral fixture on BookTok.\nWATCH | Kierra Lewis' TikTok vlog from a Seattle Kraken warm-up:\nOne user, Kierra Lewis, garnered particular attention for her playful and somewhat raunchy sports romance content. Lewis's content was so popular that the Kraken invited her to attend a playoff game, and even gifted her a custom jersey with \"BookTok\" emblazoned on the back.\nEarlier this month, however, the relationship between BookTok and the Kraken took an uncomfortable turn. What started out as lighthearted and flirty, fun content about the team later turned \"vile,\" according to Wennberg himself. The player and his wife both asked users via Instagram to stop posting explicit comments and sexualized content about him.\nCulture critic Stacy Lee Kong and romance author Farah Heron join host Elamin Abdelmahmoud to talk about what happens when companies try to capitalize on niche communities, and what it means to thirst responsibly on the internet.\nWe've included some highlights below, edited for length and clarity. For the full discussion, \nlisten and follow the Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud podcast, on your favourite podcast player.\nElamin\n: Farah, I hate to ask you this, but can you just talk about how horny BookTok generally is?\nFarah\n: BookTok is super horny. TikTok goes through trends with what's popular in the book environment there. For a while it was all about horny fantasy romance, and then it started going into extra, extra spicy contemporary romance…. Now, hockey is having a moment on BookTok. It's strange when I think about it; I'm a Canadian, hockey is just there. We don't really care much about it. But hockey is actually the biggest sports subgenre in romance outside of Canada. It's not just Canadians reading it…. It's places where hockey isn't the most popular sport. I was just reading something about Australia, that BookTok has made people interested in hockey in Australia — because before it wasn't a very popular sport.\nElamin\n: So maybe this gambit kind of succeeded a little bit too much in a way…. What are some of the questions still left to answer?\nStacy\n: We don't really know how official [the Seattle Kraken and influencer Kierra Lewis's] relationship was. We don't know whether Lewis was paid for any of the content she posted. We don't know what the team's expectations are. We don't know if there were any contractual obligations. That, I think, is actually really important because it speaks to the challenges of companies trying to capitalize on these niche communities. If you want to market your team by engaging with a community, you still need the same contracts and the same very clear expectations as in any other business relationship. I think it was \nin the New York Times\n where they were saying ice hockey is not that popular in Australia, but their professional teams have actually explicitly credited BookTok with increasing game attendance and fan interest, so you can see that there's a value…. But are you going to do this responsibly as a company? Are you going to lay out clear expectations?\nWe don't also know how much conversation there was between team management. How much did the organization tell the players? Did the players understand what this would be? Were there clear boundaries at the beginning about what could and could not be said? Were there any protections in place, or was there any conversation about what would happen if things went off the rails? Because things go off the rails on the internet all the time. We just don't know, and I think this is a really big cautionary tale about what happens when you don't have those clear guardrails.\nElamin\n: I think on a base level, Farah, we're all kind of broadly familiar with thirsting; that's not new…. To that end, there are no official rules for how to thirst responsibly on the internet. I think we should make them. Farah, how would you approach it?\nFarah\n: Think about people as being people. I'm all for BookTok finding that safe place and expressing female desire — that place where they can talk and and just be free with things that as women we've kind of been socialized not to talk about a lot, so I'm totally for it. But I think we need to remember that BookTok is not a private room.… I think you have to remember that even if the only people you're encountering and the only people you're communicating with are people from within your community, that doesn't mean that the rest of the world doesn't see it as well.\nI'm going right back to the things that we learned in kindergarten: treat people the way you want to be treated. You can thirst in ways that are not overly explicit or not very sexual harassment-y, or you can thirst on characters. Authors are creating make-believe people for you to thirst all you want. You can write and talk about anything you want about these make-believe people. But when you're talking about real people, you're crossing a line.\nElamin\n: Stacy, what are the rules for you?\nStacy\n: I think you should not actually tag anybody in your thirsts. I love fandom; I think it is so fun and so interesting, and such an interesting sort of space to explore. But you don't actually have to go to someone's front door…. If they go searching for it, that to me is a different thing than you going to them.\nI think the other thing that I really want to emphasize is that consent can be withdrawn at any time. So even if Alex Wennberg consented initially to being part of this marketing campaign, it's actually OK for him to say, \"I don't want to do this anymore. It has gone too far. It makes me uncomfortable.\" Yes, the company absolutely should expect that this would happen; this is what happens on the internet all the time, just in terms of things going where you didn't expect. But the key point is if someone doesn't want something anymore, that's OK.\nYou can listen to the full discussion from today's show on \nCBC Listen\n or on our podcast, Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud, \navailable wherever you get your podcasts\n.\nPanel produced by Jane van Koeverden\n.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

I'm crying...RIP RJ,\" wrote former Sabres player Matthew Barnaby. \"We all love you.\"\nPhiladelphia Flyers general manager Daniel Briere, a former Sabres co-captain, released a statement expressing his sadness.\n\"The Sabres family, the city of Buffalo and the National Hockey League lost an iconic voice of the game and a true gentlemen,\" Briere said. \"I will tell you that the calls he produced will live in a special place in my heart forever.\"\nJeanneret's career calling Sabres games began at the start of the 1971-72 season, the franchise's second in existence, and ended with his retirement following the 2021-22 season. He achieved the NHL's highest broadcasting honour in 2012 upon earning the Hockey Hall of Fame's Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, and his tenure as a play-by-play announcer with one team is the longest in league history.\n\"Rick was indeed a very special and very loved man, to and by all, who knew him and listened to him, his magic, and his command,\" Sabres owner Terry Pegula said. \"How glad I am to have known him.

Pegula and his wife bought the franchise in February 2011.\n\"Growing up in Buffalo, Rick Jeanneret was not just the voice of the Sabres, he was the voice of our city. He helped foster my love of hockey,\" added Sabres GM Kevyn Adams. \"I don't think there's a hockey fan in the world that doesn't know that voice. You can close your eyes and that's just the voice and that will be with us all forever.\"\nJeanneret was known for having various signature calls including \"Top shelf, where mama hides the cookies\" whenever a Sabres player scored by roofing a shot high into the net.\nOne of his most memorable calls was \"May Day! May Day!\" after Brad May scored the decisive goal in a 6-5 overtime win to clinch a four-game series sweep of Boston in the first round of the 1993 playoffs. It was also Buffalo's first playoff series win in 10 years.\nHis other notable calls included \"La-la-la-la-Fontaine!\" which followed whenever former Sabres captain Pat LaFontaine scored in the 1990s. And there was his \"Now do you believe?\" call during the Sabres' run to the Eastern Conference final in 2006.\nThe Sabres honoured Jeanneret during his final season by raising a banner bearing his name to the arena rafters. He is one of 11 people to have been honoured by the team, and third non-player, joining team founders, brothers Seymour and Northrup Knox.\nJeanneret did his best to keep his emotions in check during the ceremony amid a sold-out crowd chanting \"RJ! RJ! RJ!\"\n\"I stood down here 10 years ago upon my induction into the Sabres Hall of Fame, and I remember saying that night, this is the only job I ever wanted. This is the only place I wanted to be,\" Jeanneret said during the ceremony. \"I meant every word on that particular night. And boy, do I mean it now.\"\nAdams said the team is in discussions on how to honour Jeanneret.\n\"But I can tell you that we're going to celebrate RJ every day,\" Adams said. \"You walk into KeyBank Center, he's part of the fabric of this organization.\"\nJeanneret grew up in nearby St. Catharines, Ont., and lived in Niagara Falls.\nHe had several health scares, which led to him reducing his travel schedule.\nIn 2014, he was diagnosed with throat cancer but missed just a few games during the 2014-15 season after receiving treatment.

He was hurt on a Monday night broadcast, and the Bills open on a Monday night in what should be an emotionally charged setting honoring the 22nd anniversary of 9-11.\nHamlin has approached each step of his recovery — from being discharged from the hospital on Jan. 11 to news of doctors clearing him to resume practicing in late April to his first padded practice on July 31 — by focusing on one moment at a time.\nVulnerability, strength, perseverance\nTo peek too far ahead, he said, would be emotionally overwhelming. At the same time, Hamlin's not been one to look back, either, while dealing with the nationwide attention he's attracted.\n\"I honestly would love to do this whole process under a rock, getting myself together and then pop back out when I feel like my best,\" Hamlin once said. \"But I think there's strength in going through a process in front of everybody's eyes. It shows vulnerability and shows strength, shows perseverance, and that's things I would love to stand for.\"\nBackup quarterback Matt Barkley was placed on injured reserve after he hurt his right throwing elbow in a pre-season game at Pittsburgh, leaving Kyle Allen as starter Josh Allen's lone backup.

But Baun would go on to earn the nickname Boomer for his big hits.\nThe five-foot-nine 175-pounder collected 37 goals, 224 points and 1,489 penalty minutes in 964 regular-season games from 1956 to 1973. He added three goals, 12 assists and 171 penalty minutes in 96 playoff contests.\nBaun won Stanley Cups with the Leafs in 1962, '63, '64 and '67. But it was in the 1964 final against Detroit that he reached legendary status.\nWith the Leafs trailing 3-2 in the series, Baun, who had been in the penalty box for two of Detroit's goals, was stretchered off the ice with 13:15 remaining in the third period of Game 6 after blocking a Gordie Howe shot just above the ankle while killing a penalty.\n\"It was numb then and I couldn't figure out what was wrong,\" Baun said in an interview after the game. \"And then when I went into the faceoff with Gordie Howe, I just heard a snap and it caved in underneath me. And I tried to get up and there was no way I could put any weight on it.\nBobby Baun on hockey injuries\n\"So that was the story then. They froze my leg then and it's all right right now, of course. I can't feel it with the freezing in there.\"\nAnkle frozen and taped\nAfter being taken off the ice, he asked the doctors if he could hurt himself any more. They said no.\nHis ankle frozen and taped, Baun came back late in the third period and scored the winning goal at the 1:43 mark of overtime with a shot from the right point that beat Detroit netminder Terry Sawchuk to give Toronto a 4-3 victory.\n\"For 'The Goal,' I will always be grateful,\" he wrote in his 2000 autobiography \nLowering the Boom:The Bobby Baun Story\n with Anne Logan.\nHe called the goal \"the high point of 28 years of determination, dedication and desire.\"\nYears later Baun called the shot \"A triple-flutter-blast with a followup blooper and it went off [Detroit defenceman] Bill Gadsby's stick and went the opposite way on Sawchuk and in the net.\"\nAt the time he thought the injury might be a pinched nerve. Baun could hardly walk, but he played in Game 7 as the Leafs won 4-0 at home to hoist the Cup for the third consecutive year.\nBaun had painkilling injections before the game and between each period of the deciding game. So did teammate Red Kelly, who had torn knee ligaments in Game 6.\n \nI was in a cast for six weeks. Was it worth it? Sure it was. That's how much winning the Stanley Cup meant to me.\n— Longtime Maple Leafs defenceman Bobby Baun on breaking his leg in 1964 Stanley Cup final\nWeeks later, irritated by the cast he had to wear, Baun soaked his leg in a bathtub until the cast came off.\nIn an interview years later with hockey host Brian McFarlane, Baun described the time between Game 6 and 7.\n\"Two nights later, we won the Stanley Cup on home ice by a 4-0 score,\" he recalled. \"I had my leg iced before that game and took shots of Novocain every 10 minutes.\nStanley Cup: playing through pain\nMaple Leafs prospect Rodion Amirov dies at 21 after brain tumour diagnosis\n\"Only after the Cup was won did I go for X-rays, and they found a broken bone just above the ankle. I was in a cast for the next six weeks. Was it worth it? Sure it was. That's how much winning the Stanley Cup meant to me. Most hockey players would tell you they'd do the very same thing.\"\n'I played five years with a broken neck'\nBaun was a hard man to stop.\n\"I would say my pain tolerance is high,\" he said in an interview with the Toronto Star 50 years later. \"Pain didn't bother me much. Still doesn't. I played five years with a broken neck and didn't know it.\"\nIn 2000, Canadian Press hockey writer Neil Stevens described Baun as a \"prototypical sixties hard-rock, body-crunching, stay-at-home defenceman.\"\nThat was the year that Baun released his autobiography. While the book came out 36 years after that famous Stanley Cup goal, Baun said he was still getting 3,000 pieces of mail a year.\nBaun, then a resident of Pickering, Ont., called the attention \"pretty special.\"\nHe said his job was to stop goals not score them.\n\"If I got a goal, that was a bonus,\" he said.\nBaun was ranked No. 30 on the Leafs' top 100 players in 2016 as the franchise prepared for its centennial anniversary.\nMaple Leafs president Brendan Shanahan released a statement Tuesday: \"The Toronto Maple Leafs are deeply saddened by the passing of Bob Baun, whose enduring legacy of remarkable resilience includes his iconic overtime game-winning goal during a Stanley Cup final despite playing with a broken leg.\n\"Bob possessed unquestionable toughness and incredible pride in being a Toronto Maple Leaf. His inspirational presence continues to embody the heart of the game. He will be greatly missed by the team and its fans. Our thoughts are with Bob's loved ones during this difficult time.\"\n1st deal with Leafs paid $8K per season\nBaun's family left Saskatchewan for Toronto when he was three.\nBaun played junior for the Toronto Marlboros of the Ontario Hockey Association from 1952 to 1956, winning the Memorial Cup in 1955 and 1956 with a stint at the Leafs camp in between. He began his pro career in the American Hockey League with the Rochester Americans, playing 46 games before the Leafs called up him.\nHis first deal with Toronto paid $8,000 a year plus a $4,000 bonus.\nIconic Maple Leafs defenceman Börje Salming dies at 71\nHe spent his first 11 NHL seasons with Toronto before being taken by the Oakland Seals in the 1967 expansion draft. He spent one season with Oakland before going to Detroit the next year.\nWhile a Wing, he counselled Howe to ask for more pay, saying he was making \"twice as much money\" as the Detroit legend. An irate Howe went to Wings' front office the next morning and team owner Bruce Norris met his demands.\nBaun returned to Toronto in 1970 for the final stretch of his playing career.\nHe retired in 1972 after injuring his neck after a hit by Mickey Redmond. He had previously suffered a neck injury playing for Oakland and doctors told him if he got hurt again, there was a 95 per cent chance he would end up in a wheelchair.\nTried to sign every autograph\nOff the ice, Baun was always good to the fans, citing the example of Bobby Hull.\n\"He'd sign every last autograph people waited to get,\" Baun told The Canadian Press in 2000. \"I always tried to do the same. People take the time to wait and have an autograph signed, you should have the time to give them the time of day. That's just common courtesy in life, something we don't see often enough any more.\n\"People don't take the time or don't care about what other people have to say. If you want to talk to me, I'm willing to listen and discuss ideas. That's what's important.\"\nThe NHL Alumni Association says Baun's legacy of kindness and compassion will be remembered fondly.\nJim Pappin, 1967 Stanley Cup hero for the Maple Leafs, dead at 82\n\"Not only did he take care of his community, but he was profoundly committed to helping out his (NHL alumni) family every single day to make their tomorrow brighter,\" the association said in a statement.\nAfter ending his playing career, Baun tried his hand at farming before coaching the Toronto Toros in the World Hockey Association in 1975-76. He did not enjoy the experience much and quit.\nHe went on to sell houses and cars before joining an insurance company. He later had success in running a Tim Hortons franchise in Pickering and later opened another in nearby Ajax, eventually selling both.\n\"My other careers were a learning experience, sometimes profitable, sometimes not, but I would not trade any of that,\" Baun wrote in his autobiography. \"But in honest reflection, what has affected my life the most was that goal I scored on April 23, 1964.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The union cited Spain's sports law that sanctions acts that \"damage the dignity\" of someone or \"creates an atmosphere of intimidation\" based on unwanted conduct related to gender or race.\n\"The incident regarding Jenni Hermoso is especially grave since she finds herself in a situation of vulnerability before a person in a position of power,\" the union said. \"A once-in-a-lifetime celebration for the Spanish players has been overshadowed by the improper behaviour of the federation president.\"\nSpain wins its 1st Women's World Cup title, beating England 1-0\nWhy the 2023 Women's World Cup could be a watershed moment for women's soccer\nSpain's Higher Council for Sports told The Associated Press that on Tuesday it received a formal complaint against Rubiales filed by the president of Spain's national school for soccer coaches, Miguel Galan.

The president of the soccer federation is chosen by representatives of clubs, players, coaches, referees and regional federation heads.\nThe Spain squad was in near-mutiny last year because of some players' complaints about the culture under coach Jorge Vilda, demanding better coaching and preparation to get more out of the team.\nRubiales backed Vilda and only three of the 15 players who complained were included on the World Cup team. The federation did take some steps toward improving the conditions of the players, which included a financial package to allow them to bring family members to the World Cup and permission for players with children to spend time with them.\nWATCH l Spain tops England to take home its first Women's World Cup trophy:\nSpain wins Women’s World Cup over England\n19 days ago\nDuration \n1:59\nSpain took home its first Women’s World Cup trophy with a 1-0 win over England that came despite major off-field disputes that saw 15 players walk away from the team last year.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Debate over Calgary road's murky origins refuses to die", "summary": "Could this street really be named after a Montreal Canadiens icon, or is that an apocryphal tale?", "content": "Driving along southbound Crowchild Trail in southwest Calgary you'll see a green exit sign for a road running adjacent to Mount Royal University. Its name is Richard Road.\nBut how did you just pronounce that name in your head?\nFor many, it would be Richard, like Nixon, Branson or Little. Little Richard, that is.\nBut to some Calgarians, that's using the wrong emphasis. The wrong accent, if you will.\nThe debate over that road and its pronunciation resurfaced recently on CBC Calgary airwaves when a listener challenged the pronunciation of Richard Road.\nHe argued — quite stridently — that it is pronounced using the French emphasis.\nAnd the reason for that, the Calgary Eyeopener listener wrote, is because it was named in honour of Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard, an iconic Montreal Canadiens winger who played from 1942-1960.\nMaurice \"Rocket\" Richard, of the Montreal Canadiens, is shown in action on Dec. 14, 1954.  (AP Photo)\n \n(The Associated Press)\nThis isn't the first time this has been pointed out to CBC Calgary. A mere mention of the road's name has elicited similar calls to the station's traffic line for years.  \nSo what is the origin story of this road in Calgary? That question is not easy to answer.\nRichard Road's past naming controversy\nBetween the City of Calgary's archive department and an online archive of printed newspapers in Alberta, there are a few early mentions of Richard Road.\nIn 1970, when the city was considering names for future development in the area where Richard Road is now, there was actually a bit of controversy on the Calgary Planning Commission.\nIn notes from the commissioners' report on March 4, 1970, council approved two street names for what was formerly the Royal Canadian Air Force Station Lincoln Park: Richard and Richardson.\nWhat made headlines at that time, however, was not the names that were approved, but one that was shot down that day: Richthofen.\nAs in Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, a famous First World War German fighter pilot.\nA clipping from the Calgary Herald on January 22, 1970 discussing the controversy around a proposed street name in a S.W. city neighbourhood.\n \n(Calgary Herald)\nOne headline from the Calgary Herald on Jan. 22, 1970 reads \"Richthofen Bombs As Street Name.\"\nFormer Calgary alderman Roy Farran is quoted at that time saying, \"We have the greatest respect for the Blue Max and the Red Baron and all that. But really, they were on the other side.\"\nThe article also points out that the name Richardson was chosen to honour a prominent figure in the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede at that time.\nNo reason for submitting the name Richard was noted in either the newspaper clippings or the city documents.\nCBC News could find no mention of a connection between Maurice Richard and Richard Road in the online archives of the city's two major dailies between 1940 and the present day.\nIn the 1970s, when the discussion over naming streets in this area was happening, Calgary did not yet have an NHL team. Maurice Richard retired in 1960. There is no monument. No documented ceremony.\nAdding to the mystery, there were notices posted in the pages of Calgary newspapers in the early 1950s advertising lots for sale on a \"Richard Road\" in nearby Knob Hill for $1,050. \nQuite a bargain, even with inflation.\nAccording to city archives, the Lincoln Park Community, where Richard Road sits, was developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Some wonder if the road's name has a military connection, given its location.\n \nI don't think we can ever know for sure unless someone who was there comes forward to set the record straight.\n- Lynn Bullock, City of Calgary archives\n\"The road may well have been named by someone who lived in the area prior to development or by the RCAF who occupied the area during the Second World War and until 1964. There would have been married quarters as well as the base itself,\" wrote Lynn Bullock with city archives in an email to CBC News.\nBullock said it is also possible the city's planning department renamed some streets in 1970s (at the time of the Richthofen controversy) but she added: \"I don't think we can ever know for sure unless someone who was there comes forward to set the record straight.\"\nWhat's in a name\nAt the public library, there is a book that ties Rocket Richard to Richard Road.\nThat book was published in 1995, called \nWhat's in a Name … Calgary: A look at the people behind place names in Calgary.\nIn it, author Donna Mae Humber wrote that the area near where Richard Road sits was originally planned as a subdivision called Richmond Park.\n\"When the major streets were being named, the city's planning department was looking for something different than the standard English-sounding names, and decided to name a street after a prominent French Canadian,\" she wrote.\n\"They chose Maurice 'Rocket' Richard (pronounced \"Ree-shard\"), who played hockey for the Montreal Canadiens from 1942 to 1960 he held the record for the most goals scored in regular season play.\"\nWhen you read this sign, how do you say it? Calgarians are split.\n \n(Natalie Valleau/CBC Calgary)\nCBC News reached out to Humber to inquire about where she learned this story and, after this article was published, she got in touch.\nHumber relayed she came across the story of Richard Road in a single newspaper article she found in the Glenbow Museum's archives.\n\"It was really hard finding information back in in 1994 ... but I did a lot of digging ... and I found an article that was about Richard Road and that's what they called it,\" she said, using the French emphasis.\nHumber is amused the mystery of the road's inspiration has persisted.\n\"I just have to laugh because, I don't know, does it really matter?\"\nLocal historians Harry Sanders and Heritage Calgary's Josh Traptow haven't unearthed any evidence of that information anywhere else, and neither has the city archivist.\nRichard White has written extensively on urban development in Calgary and, based on his own research, he leans toward the anglicized pronunciation of Richard Road. \n\"I mean, there was the armed forces bases there. There would have been many individuals from Quebec and Montreal, Canadiens fans, but I don't know that there's any real substantiation,\" he said.\nWhite, however, likes the story of Rocket Richard, even if he has his doubts.\n\"I think it's just a bit of a folklore,\" he said. \"It makes for a great story.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Terms of the deal were not announced.", "content": "Head coach Sheldon Keefe quickly impressed new Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving by being accountable for Toronto's recent playoff failures.\nKeefe signed a two-year contract extension with the Maple Leafs on Wednesday, keeping him as the team's head coach until at least 2025. Treliving said that Keefe's leadership skills made the new deal possible.\n\"Sheldon was really transparent and honest and accountable for what's going on here,\" said Treliving, who joined Toronto on May 31, almost two weeks after its second-round playoff exit. \"I always think you have to first start with yourself and critique your own performance, which I think Sheldon has done.\n\"I look at what he does over the course of the summer in terms of connecting with our players, getting their feedback on certain things, also looking at ways that we can change.\"\nMatthews says focus solely on hockey, winning after signing extension with Maple Leafs\nThe 42-year-old Keefe was named Maple Leafs head coach on Nov. 20, 2019, taking over after Mike Babcock was fired following a 9-10-4 start to the season. Keefe has posted a 166-71-30 regular-season record since then, making the playoffs every year.\nHowever, Toronto has yet to translate that success to the post-season.\nThe Maple Leafs beat Tampa Bay in six games in the first round of the 2022-23 playoffs, its first post-season series win since 2004. But Toronto went on to lose to the eighth-seeded Florida Panthers in the next round.\n\"The success this team has had in the regular season, it'd be safe to say, 'OK, we're going to stay status quo,\"' said Treliving in a video call with reporters. \"But [Keefe is exploring and pushing the envelope on ways that we can be better.\"\nWATCH | Maple Leafs eliminated by Panthers in 2nd round:\nCousins Game 5 overtime winner gives Panthers series win over Maple Leafs\n4 months ago\nDuration \n1:49\nNick Cousins scored in the first overtime to give Florida a 3-2 win in game four over Toronto, eliminating the Maple Leafs 4-1 in the series.\nKeefe first joined the Maple Leafs organization as head coach of the minor-league Toronto Marlies in June 2015. In parts of five seasons with the Marlies, Keefe led the club to a 199-89-22-9 record in 319 regular season games.\nIn that span, the Marlies won the franchise's first ever Calder Cup championship in 2018, and they also won the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy as AHL regular season champions on two occasions. The team made four consecutive playoff appearances with Keefe at the helm and posted a 38-21 post-season record.\n\"Coaching this team has been a great privilege, and I'm truly excited at the opportunity to continue building towards our ultimate goal,\" said Keefe in a statement. \"We have so many great players and people within our organization that I'm grateful to work with, and together our commitment to team success remains steadfast.\"\nGM says players supported extension\nSigning Keefe to an extension was another key piece of off-season business done for Treliving, who also inked star centre Auston Matthews to a four-year $53-million US extension last week.\n\"A lot of people may speculate that the reason [the Keefe deal is] done is the noise and the distractions,\" said Treliving. \"I think, as a manager, you're always trying to eliminate distractions.\n\"But I want to be clear, this gets done because I really think we've got a good coach here and his record in the regular season has proved it.\"\nTreliving said Keefe's contract extension was made after consultation with several of the Leafs players, tricky for a new general manager still getting to know his personnel.\n\"It's not a popularity contest, but you can tell when a coach has had an impact on them and when they believe that the coach's had an impact on their team. They get pushed,\" said Treliving. \"That was one of the things that came back to me really consistently from the players that it's not they're going to bat for their buddy, per se, as much as they believe that they've grown as a group.\n\"There's uncomfortable times, at certain times, because he's demanding and he expects a lot, he pushes these guys, but there's a real trust factor from what I've gathered from the players.\"\nThe Maple Leafs begin their pre-season on Sept. 24 in Ottawa against the Senators.

The kiss marred the title celebrations in Sydney, Australia, on Sunday, and criticism has steadily mounted.\nHermoso issued a statement Friday strongly rebuking Rubiales' characterization of the kiss as consensual, saying that 'in no moment' did she consent to the kiss, while the 46-year-old federation president cast himself as the victim at an emergency meeting of the federation in Madrid.\n\"I won't resign,\" he declared four times in quick succession, to applause from the overwhelmingly male audience.\nSeveral Spanish news media outlets reported on Thursday that Rubiales would step down.

Del Amo had urged Rubiales to also resign.\nAmong those applauding Rubiales were women's national team coach Jorge Vilda and men's national team coach Luis de la Fuente.

But it does show that his feet were on the ground before he held her face and kissed her.\nHermoso contradicted Rubiales' version in two statements, one issued through her FUTRPO players union and a second published on social media.\nShe said that she did not consent to the kiss or try to pick up the president, and that there was no conversation like the one described by Rubiales.\n\"I won't tolerate anyone doubting my word and even less someone putting words in my mouth,\" she said.\nIn a second statement, Hermoso said the kiss \"left me in a state of shock.\"\n\"I believe that no person in any workplace should be the victim of this type of nonconsensual behaviour,\" she added.\nHermoso also accused the federation of pressuring her and her family to speak out in Rubiales' defence. The federation previously denied a report that it forced her to make a statement downplaying the kiss shortly after it happened.\nAfter a full day of accusations and counteraccusations between Hermoso and Rubiales, the federation issued a statement early Saturday saying that its president did not lie and that he and the organization would take legal action against Hermoso and her union. The statement included photos that it said show Hermoso lifting Rubiales off the ground during the medals ceremony.\n'This is unacceptable'\nThe FUTPRO statement signed by Hermoso, her 22 teammates, and more than 50 other Spanish players said they would no longer play for Spain \"if the present leadership remains in charge.\"\nRubiales said he would defend his honour in court against politicians, including two ministers, who called his kiss an act of sexual violence. One of them was acting Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda Diaz, who urged the government to take \"urgent measures.\"\n\"Impunity for macho actions is over,\" Diaz said. \"Rubiales cannot continue in office.\"\nAlexia Putellas, Hermoso's teammate and a two-time Ballon d'Or winner as the best player in the world, posted a message of support on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\"This is unacceptable,\" the Barcelona player wrote. \"I'm with you, my teammate, Jenni Hermoso.\"\nWATCH | Spain captures Women's World Cup title:\nSpain wins Women’s World Cup over England\n19 days ago\nDuration \n1:59\nSpain took home its first Women’s World Cup trophy with a 1-0 win over England that came despite major off-field disputes that saw 15 players walk away from the team last year.\nOther teammates quickly followed, along with players from abroad.\n\"I'm disgusted by the public actions of Luis Rubiales,\" U.S. soccer star Alex Morgan said on X. She added that winning a World Cup \"should be one of the best moments in these players' lives but instead it's overshadowed by assault, misogyny, and failures by the Spanish federation.\"\nThe president of Spain's women's league, Beatriz Alvarez, told Spanish state broadcaster RTVE that she was not surprised because Rubiales' \"ego is above his dignity.\"\n\"What surprises and scandalizes me are his words,\" Alvarez said. \"Every time he speaks he shows what kind of person he really is.\"\nSpain's government plans to file lawsuit\nSpain's government planned to file a lawsuit Friday alleging that Rubiales violated the country's sports laws, according to Victor Francos, secretary of state for sports and head of Spain's Higher Council for Sports. If Spain's Administrative Court for Sports agrees to hear the suit, the council will suspend Rubiales temporarily pending the court's ruling, Francos said.\nIf found guilty by the court for committing sexist acts, Rubiales could be ruled unfit to hold office. Francos said he would ask the court to move its regular Thursday meeting up to Monday.\nAround 100 people, mostly women, gathered Friday night in front of the Spanish soccer federation's headquarters in Madrid to call for Rubiales' resignation, many waving red cards used by soccer referees to expel players from games.\n\"What has to happen now is his resignation and the resignation of everyone who applauded him,\" said 39-year-old protester Alma Dona. \"The federation needs to be reformed and women's football should have more support.\"\nSpanish soccer club Barcelona, which provided nine players for Spain's team, said Rubiales' behavior \"was completely inappropriate.\" Real Madrid said it supported the government's decision to try to suspend Rubiales. Sevilla called for his resignation. Athletic Bilbao said it was renouncing its seat on the federation's board and backed the government's decisions. Osasuna slammed Rubiales, calling him \"rude and sexist.\" Espanyol, Valencia, and Celta Vigo also issued statements against Rubiales, as did Spanish league president Javier Tebas.\nFIFA gives no timetable for ruling\nFIFA, the governing body of soccer, opened a disciplinary case against Rubiales on Thursday. Disciplinary judges can impose sanctions on individuals ranging from warnings and fines to suspensions from the sport. FIFA gave no timetable for the ruling.\nThe Netherlands-based FIFPRO player's union, which had already demanded action against Rubiales, reiterated its position after his assembly speech.\nSpanish soccer chief apologizes for inappropriate kiss with player after World Cup win\nThe only relevant institution to remain silent has been European soccer body UEFA, for which Rubiales is a vice president. FIFPRO urged UEFA to open its own disciplinary case.\nRubiales, who led the Spanish players union for eight years before taking over as federation president in 2018, is currently heading the UEFA-backed bid to host the men's World Cup in 2030. Spain is bidding with neighbouring Portugal and Morocco, and also possibly Ukraine.\nRubiales made 339,000 euros ($365,000 US) in 2021 after taxes, for presiding over the federation with a budget of 382 million euros ($412 million). The federation runs Spain's men's and women's national soccer teams and its semi-professional and amateur soccer leagues. It also organizes the referees for La Liga. The government maintains some oversight of the entity but it cannot name or remove its executives.\nShortly before the kiss, Rubiales grabbed his crotch in a victory gesture, with Queen Letizia of Spain and 16-year old Princess Sofia standing nearby.\nHe offered an apology for that, saying it was in a moment of \"euphoria\" and directed toward Vilda on the field.\nThe first members of the elite in Spanish men's soccer spoke out against Rubiales on Thursday, when it looked like he was bowing out. Their words of reproach continued to trickle in after Rubiales' diatribe on Friday.\n\"What an embarrassment,\" former Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas said on X. \"We should have spent the last five days talking about our women players, about the joy they gave us all! About how proud we are that they gave us a title that we didn't have in women's soccer, instead...\"\nReal Betis forward Borja Iglesias, who has occasionally been called up for Spain's national team, said he would not play for his country again \"until things change.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

There were record-breaking audiences, adversity, young stars on the rise and the continued fight for equality. Here are a few takeaways from a tournament hosted so spectacularly by Australia and New Zealand. \nNew champion \nIt was a triumphant finish in what was a turbulent year for La Roja. \nOlga Carmona's first-half goal was enough for Spain to raise its first Women's World Cup trophy in just its third appearance, now owning the distinction of being the only nation to own U-17, U-20 and senior world titles all at one time. \nThey are a powerhouse and are here to stay, in spite of a simmering dispute with their federation which caused 15 players to resign from national team duty a year ago, citing their mental health and demands for a more professional environment. \nWhile some returned, such as Golden Ball winner Aitana Bonmati, others did not, including Barcelona standouts goalkeeper Sandra Panos, defender Mapi Leon and Patri Guijarro.\nEven in their biggest moment of celebration, it was their federation's president \nstealing headlines for inappropriate behaviour. \nIf the top nation in women's football is experiencing this kind of treatment, it casts a dark cloud over the working and playing environments of other nations around the world, many of which have been documented. \nWATCH | Spain wins its 1st Women's World Cup:\nWhy women earn less than men at the FIFA World Cup\n22 days ago\nDuration \n2:30\nWomen soccer players at the FIFA World Cup will on average earn one fourth of what the men made in Qatar last year, according to numbers released by the organization. What’s behind this pay gap?\nOvercoming adversity\nThere were other nations who overcame disputes with their federations to accomplish record results. There is inspiring story of Jamaica's Reggae Girlz having to crowdfund their way to Australia ahead of the tournament and rely on the ongoing support of family and friends instead of their own Jamaican Football Federation.\nNigeria's Super Falcons, who took finalists England to a penalty shootout in the quarterfinals, have allegedly not been paid by their federation since 2021. Global players' union FIFPro is now assisting them with remuneration. \nThen there were Olympic champion Canada, who succumbed in the Group of Death amid their own battle with Canada Soccer over equal pay. Canada still remains the only top 10 nation in the world currently without a domestic professional women's league (Diana Matheson's Project 8 is expected to launch in 2025). \nAustralia overcame an injury to Sam Kerr — the face of the World Cup and one of the best strikers in the world — in the group stage.  The captain returned as a substitute in the Round of 16 and quarterfinals before scoring one of the best goals in the tournament in a semifinal loss to England. \nWhy the 2023 Women's World Cup could be a watershed moment for women's soccer\nSpain wins its 1st Women's World Cup title, beating England 1-0\nNo team was hit by the injury bug perhaps more than the European champion Lionesses. Starters Leah Williamson, Beth Mead and Fran Kirby all missed the tournament with knee injuries. Still, the side marched on, showcasing the depth of the program and buoyed by the impact of the Women's Super League and the development pathway it provides for its young players. It won't be their last World Cup final appearance. \nGrowing tournament, growing the game \nI wrote this on X, formerly known as Twitter, after the group stage. \"To all the doubters who thought expanding to 32 teams wasn't a good idea, that women's football didn't have the 'depth.' Hope you're eating those words.\"\nIn terms of blowouts, there were a handful, but none in double digits. \nAnd the eight debutant teams (Haiti, Morocco, Panama, Philippines, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Vietnam and Zambia) more than held their own, including the Philippines first-ever World Cup win at the expense of co-host New Zealand. \nAs FIFA Technical Study Group lead and two-time World Cup-winning head coach Jill Ellis of the U.S. noted: \"Progress is the biggest success story of this tournament so far. Emerging nations are showing they can compete at this level and the gaps with the top teams are closing. \nOpinion\nWomen's World Cup was great success in all kinds of ways, but the work isn't over\n\"The investment in the women's game is bearing results already. Players are fitter, have better technique and are tactically more astute. The games are faster, and the standard of coaching is higher.\" \nEstablished nations fell earlier than expected. Back-to-back defending champions U.S. team exited in the Round of 16 (their first time not making a semifinal at a Women's World Cup). Two-time champions and No. 2-ranked Germany were ousted in the group stage. No. 8 Brazil and Olympic gold medallist Canada also made unceremonious exits in the opening round.\nCountries made their inaugural trip into knockout stages, like Jamaica (world No. 43), South Africa (No. 54) and \nMorocco (No. 72)\n. \nColombia (No. 25) made its first foray in the quarterfinals and Nigeria (No. 40) made it back to the final eight for the first time since 1999. \nWATCH | Spain wins its 1st Women's World Cup:\nSpain wins Women’s World Cup over England\n19 days ago\nDuration \n1:59\nSpain took home its first Women’s World Cup trophy with a 1-0 win over England that came despite major off-field disputes that saw 15 players walk away from the team last year.\nRecord interest \nJust shy of two million fans attended the tournament, up by 600,000 from the 2019 edition in France.\nYes, the tournament expanded from 64 matches from 52 four years ago, but the average attendance per match was up significantly: 30,911 from 21,756. It's also worth noting that 10 matches had crowds of 45,000-plus. \nIn terms of broadcast, BBC reported 12 million peak viewers for Sunday's final against Spain, plus an additional four million online. It's the second most-watched BBC event this year after the coronation of King Charles in May. \nAccording to Reuters, in Spain, 5.6 million watched the final, with a peak audience of 7.4 million viewers.\nIn Australia, Channel Seven reported they had 11.15 million peak viewers for the Matildas-Lionesses semifinal, the highest viewership since the metric began being recorded in 2001. \nChina recorded the highest TV audience for a single match at this year's tournament with 53.9 million tuning in for their loss to England.\nNumbers from a global perspective are not yet in, but are expected to surpass the 2019 record of 1.12 billion people. \nDancing, drums, enthusiasm galore \nAs reported by my colleague on the ground, Shireen Ahmed, the \nNigerian team upon their arrival for their opening match against Canada were as joyous as could be\n. The Super Falcons danced their way into Melbourne's Rectangular Stadium (and danced their way out with a key nil-nil draw after goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie denied Canadian captain Christine Sinclair from the penalty spot).\nAnd how about the sweet songs of South Africa's Banyana Banyana? \nOutside of co-hosts Matildas and Football Ferns, did any nation seem to have as much support as Colombia? \nTravelling fans and ex-pats showed up for their teams, whether it was the Republic of Ireland's fans roaring in Perth (especially when Katie McCabe scored that Olimpico against Canada) or Argentina supporters donning the white and sky blue to cheer on La Albiceleste in New Zealand.  \nLinda Caicedo \nWas there a more captivating young player on the pitch than 18-year-old Linda Caicedo of Colombia? Her goal against Germany? Dancing around two defenders then a blast into the top right corner. Exquisite. \nShe became the first player to play in three different World Cups in a calendar year, including the U-17 and U-20 World Cups.\nTo think this promising career was hanging in the balance three years ago after a devastating diagnosis of ovarian cancer is unfathomable when you watch the magic she brings every time she touches the ball. She told reporters she hopes to be an inspiration to others facing cancer. \nWith a player like Caicedo as its backbone, South America has another emerging power other than Brazil. \nYouth movement\nCaicedo headlined a list of young stars that shared the spotlight in Australia and New Zealand. \nPrime example is Spain's super substitute Salma Paralluelo, the 19-year-old winger and former national track star who scored two of the team's most important goals in the tournament. She had the 2-1 extra time goal against the Netherlands in the quarterfinals and the opening goal in a 2-1 victory versus Sweden in the semifinal. \nSalma Paralluelo, 19, emerges as star in Spain's run to Women's World Cup final\nParalluelo's play earned her the FIFA Best Young Player Award. She is now a champion at the U-17, U-20 and senior level. Expect even bigger things from the electric Barcelona player in major tournaments to come. \nWhile we didn't get a full picture of what England's Lauren James can do thanks to that ill-advised stamp (and subsequent red card) to Nigeria's Michelle Alozie's back in the Round of 16, it's clear she has the ability to turn a match on its head. The 21-year-old was England's top scorer with three goals and three assists.   \nFrom Australian forward Mary Fowler and Dutch midfielder Esmee Brugts, both 20, to 19-year-old Haitian midfielder Melchie Dumornay, the football world's future is in good hands. ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Beaudoin spoke to the CBC's Gareth Hampshire about what it meant to be there and the excitement during the games.\nThe tournament set attendance records, according to the sport's governing body FIFA, which expected as many as two billion people to watch around the world.\n\"It's great to see the growth of the women's game,\" said Beaudoin. \"Even in the last four years since the last World Cup, the amount of interest has grown exponentially.\"\n'Wow, I was there when this happened'\nBeaudoin, who also refereed matches at the 2019 World Cup in France, has been refereeing internationally since 2014.\nHer journey to that level began by refereeing grassroots kids' games before she moved up to more competitive levels by earning her regional badge in 2008. Then progressing to the provincial level a year later, and eventually gaining her national badge in 2013. \nShe has been refereeing professional men's soccer in the Canadian Premier League since 2019.\nBeaudoin tosses a coin to begin the July 22 match between Denmark and China. \n \n(FIFA)\nAt the Women's World Cup, she took charge of Denmark's 1-0 win over China in Perth, before being appointed to referee Norway's 6-0 victory against the Philippines in Auckland. \nBeaudoin was then chosen as the fourth official, assisting the referee from the sidelines for Australia's win over Denmark, at a sold out, noisy Stadium in Sydney.\n\"There is a bit more excitement, a bit more passion from the fans,\" she said about being involved in a match with the home team. \nBeing on the touchline to hear the screams and feel the emotion from Australian supporters when their team scored in a game that put them in the quarter-finals was one of her highlights of the competition. \n\"Those are the type of moments in life you have to pause for a second and look around and say, 'Wow, I was there when this happened.'\"\nBeaudoin was able to check video replays available on the sidelines during the game between Norway and the Philippines. \n \n(FIFA)\nGetting picked to referee games at the highest level is a reward for relentless training, preparation and validation for the continual assessment of her refereeing performances in the Canadian Premier League by both Canadian and FIFA officials.\n\"People often think of the World Cup as a four-week event, but for us as referees it has been a four-year process,\" Beaudoin said.\nShe is also quick to pay tribute to the other members of her team, assistant referees Chantal Boudreau, from Saskatchewan and Stephanie Yee Sing from Jamaica.\nThey were the ones with the flags assisting her on the sideline for her games and are connected by electronic communication.\n\"We are selected as trios and we work with the same assistant referees leading up to the world cup for years in order to fine tune our communication and our understanding,\" she explained.\nBeaudoin's refereeing team signed the ball that is outfitted with goal line technology and was used for the game between Denmark and China.\n \n(Brian McKay/CBC)\nThe refs on the pitch are also aided today by video assistant referees who have access to replays of the action from a number of different camera angles.\nMonitors on the side of the field allow the refs to check their decisions when necessary.\nAnd there is technology in the ball itself.

We witnessed the host countries flourish with support, and we watched a team mobilize to win the greatest prize in women's football under tumultuous circumstances.\nBut we had hardly a moment to savour the joy before it was brutally snatched from the players and fans and completely overtaken by Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF).\nSince that moment when Rubiales aggressively kissed Spanish player Jenni Hermoso at the trophy ceremony, we have seen the situation descend into what can only be described as a \nwretched plot\n from a B-grade telenovela.\nIn no short order, there was an offering of a \nnon-apology apology from Rubiales\n (complete with \ng\nirl dad narratives\n), incorrect statements issued by RFEF, staff resigning in protest, a suspension by FIFA, and team head coach Jorge Vilda supporting — then distancing himself — from Rubiales, who is so bound to his own ego that the entire federation is at risk of imploding. All while Spain is pursuing co-hosting the 2030 World Cup.\nI didn't even get to the part where Rubiales's mother (yes, his mother) has \nholed up in a church on a hunger strike \nin protest of the \"inhuman hunt\" against her son. It sounds absurd and laughable, but the situation is not funny. It's frustrating and deflating, but also unsurprising. \nFIFA suspends Spain soccer chief over World Cup kiss that player says wasn't consensual\nSpain's acting prime minister criticizes federation head for kissing player\nProtestors hold a sign reading 'Rubiales and macho mafia out' during a demonstration called by feminist associations in support to Spain's midfielder Jenni Hermoso, in Madrid on Aug. 28.\n \n(AFP via Getty Images)\nLast week, instead of celebrating in Ibiza as she should have been, Hermoso released a statement that the kiss from Rubiales was \nnot consensual\n — he claims he asked her and she agreed.\nHow could it have been in the nanosecond of interaction on the stage and with this type of power dynamic? Would she even have felt comfortable saying no, particularly to a man who supported the same coach \nmany players on the team wanted gone\n? The same man that is part of \na tradition of frustration and disrespect \nto women's soccer in Spain.\nThe entire situation reeks of men holding power, the sheer absence of accountability and about a historic moment that has been bulldozed by a federation that seems it will protect that man at whatever cost. Of the 140 members of the RFEF, only six are women.\nThere is a growing army of women and allies supporting women players who are fed up with a system of misogyny and chauvinism in Spain. Different leagues, players and athletes have taken to social media to declare their support for Hermoso. Even players like Iker Casillas, Andres Iniesta and the legendary Xavi (now head coach of Barcelona FC) have spoken out about Rubiales in an unprecedented manner.  \n🎙 Xavi: \"Quiero dar mi apoyo incondicional a Jennifer Hermoso y a las jugadoras.

It is about players who work so hard to be the best in the world but have to shorten their happiest moment in order to navigate a completely chaotic mess. It is about how women can never be \njust\n athletes, they need to be advocates and protectors of each other and \"pick the right battles.\"\nIt is about the other survivors, like those in \nHaiti\n, \nAfghanistan\n and \nZambia\n, who got very little attention from football media when they spoke out about sexualized violence in their federations and whose longing for justice remains unrequited. FIFA did very little to protect them — just as it does the least possible now.  At the time of writing this, neither FIFA nor UEFA (Rubiales is conveniently the UEFA vice-president) has yet to make a public statement. \nIt is about feeling like a sport doesn't love you back when there are hordes of people in power protecting disingenuous people and deplorable characters. We should consider that Spain is a federation that might have so much to hide that they can't risk turning their backs on Rubiales, who might metaphorically stab them back.

The lesson can be about bravery and a series of voices that has become a global chorus and now an uprising and one that could be Spanish football's own reckoning with abuse.\nIt makes me wonder where Canada sits and how we could prevent this kind of mess from happening. Are we doing what's best for our current players, and creating better spaces for future ones? \nIn the last few years women's soccer has become increasingly popular. This Women's World Cup \nwas the most successful to date\n, but there remains so much wrong with men in the women's soccer ecosystem. There are people who refuse to make it better and their entitlement and arrogance may hurt soccer for a long time.\nGreat play of Spanish team overshadowed\nRage may fuel a revolution but is it justice that we will finally see? Will it be a warning to other men who disrespect women on the pitch, behind closed doors, or will this circus continue to be a frenzy of men of power trying to save themselves while imploring their female relatives to help them? \nSpain have only been world champions for a little more than a week but will we remember their clinical attacking in play? Will we regale about their tiki taka and perfect passes that were so beautiful they made us gleeful? Will we remember a final of stellar goalkeeping? \nAt this point, we are in danger of remembering this World Cup with Rubiales as the front man. I hope as we go forward we remember it as a tournament that ignited an uprising; an uprising that resulted in more power and agency for women. And a movement that is as beautiful and powerful as the game itself.  ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

The new law eliminated the difference between \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual assault,\" sanctioning any unconsented sexual act.\nSpanish player Jenni Hermoso accuses Luis Rubiales of sexual assault after World Cup kiss\nProsecutors added Friday that Rubiales could have committed an act of coercion when, according to Hermoso, he pressured her to speak out in his defence immediately after the scandal erupted regarding his behaviour.\nRubiales has insisted the kiss was consensual.

If the National Court judge agrees the hear the case, it would lead to a formal court investigation that will end with a recommendation for the case to either be dismissed or go to trial.\nHermoso, a 33-year-old forward, now plays for Mexican club Pachuca after a long career with top Spanish and European clubs, including Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid. She returned to her Mexican club on Thursday.\nThe 46-year-old Rubiales faces threats other than a possible criminal trial.\nFaces multiple punishments\nHe was suspended from his post by FIFA on Aug. 27, a day after he refused to step down when he delivered a defiant speech to the general assembly of his federation in which he said he was victim of a \"witch hunt\" by \"false feminists.\" Rubiales was banned from his post for 90 days while FIFA disciplinary judges consider his case. Soccer's governing body can impose sanctions on individuals ranging from warnings and fines to suspensions from the sport.\nRubiales also faces action from the Spanish government. A government legal panel overseeing sports has opened a probe to determine if he abused his authority by kissing Hermoso or tainted the image of Spain with his conduct. He faces being deemed unfit to hold his post for up to two years.\nSpanish soccer federation dismisses women's national team coach amid Rubiales controversy\nRubiales' behaviour at the final, which included a lewd crotch grab while next to dignitaries including Spain's queen and teenage princess, combined with his controversial speech have tarnished the Women's World Cup title and damaged his own federation.\nSpain's women's players have said they won't play again for their nation until big changes are made in the federation. The federation fired coach Jorge Vilda, but the players have yet to say if they consider that sufficient.\nThe accusation by prosecutors against Rubiales came as the players for Spain's women's league began their strike on the opening day of the competition after salary talks with the league broke down. The league, called Liga F, was one of the first soccer institutions to criticize Rubiales' conduct.\nIncreasing power in UEFA\nRubiales, a former player and former head of Spain's biggest players' union, has run the federation since 2018. He has boosted revenues and funding for lower-level soccer and the women's game, but his successes have normally been tinged with scandal.\nRubiales revolutionized the Spanish Super Cup in 2019 by taking it to Saudi Arabia — now the big draw for top European talent like Cristiano Ronaldo — in exchange for $40 million US a year. The move was criticized by women's and human rights groups for the regime's treatment of women and minorities. Spanish authorities also scrutinized the deal, and an investigative judge is probing the legality of the Super Cup contracts.\nRubiales increased his power by becoming a vice president of European soccer body UEFA, and was supposed to lead the bid by Spain, Portugal and Morocco to host the 2030 men's World Cup. Spain's government has since warned that the bid to host one of the world's biggest sporting events is at risk of being sullied.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

That means no relays, no synchronized diving or water polo, and none of the artistic swimming duets and teams which have brought Russia a string of Olympic gold medals.\n\"No improvement has been observed in this situation\" was the verdict of the Russian Swimming Federation on Tuesday. The president of Russia's governing body for artistic swimming, three-time Olympic gold medallist Olga Brusnikina, told broadcaster Match TV that \"very serious\" damage had been done to Russia's hopes of competing.\nWorld Aquatics said it is likely the world championships in February will be the first of its competitions to feature neutral athletes.

She also said she and her family were pressured by the federation to show her support for Rubiales in the immediate aftermath of the scandal caused by the kiss that tarnished her team's victory.\nThe prosecutors' office in Madrid said that, according to a sexual consent law passed last year, Rubiales could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty. The new law eliminated the difference between \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual assault,\" sanctioning any unconsented sexual act.\nSpain's government, players' unions, players and many citizens have come out in support of Hermoso. Rubiales, meanwhile, has become a soccer outcast even while he refuses to resign.\nRubiales was suspended from his post by FIFA on Aug. 27, a day after he refused to step down when he delivered a defiant speech to the general assembly of his federation in which he said he was victim of a \"witch hunt\" by \"false feminists.\" Rubiales was banned from his post for 90 days while the body's disciplinary judges consider his case.

A government legal panel overseeing sports has opened a probe to determine if he abused his authority by kissing Hermoso or tainted the image of Spain with his conduct.

Prosecutors had said last week that they were going to meet with Hermoso to give her the opportunity to present an accusation against Rubiales. Interim federation president Pedro Rocha is considered an ally of Rubiales.\nIn that Aug. 26 speech before the federation assembly, Rubiales said the kiss was \"mutual\" and like one \"I could give one of my daughters.\"\nHermoso responded by saying that was a lie.\n\"I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part,\" Hermoso said in a statement posted on social media. \"Simply put, I was not respected.\"\nHermoso, a 33-year-old forward, now plays for Mexican club Pachuca after a long career with top Spanish and European clubs, including Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid.\nRubiales's behaviour at the final, which included a lewd crotch grab while next to dignitaries including Spain's queen and teenage princess, combined with his controversial speech have torn Spanish soccer apart.\nFIFA suspends Spain soccer chief over World Cup kiss that player says wasn't consensual\nOpinion\nFuror over Luis Rubiales is not about a kiss, it's about women feeling safe playing a sport they love\nOn Tuesday, the federation headed by interim president Pedro Rocha fired the coach of Spain's Women's World Cup champion team, Jorge Vilda. Despite leading the team to the title, Vilda was still considered an unpopular figure among its players and close to Rubiales. One year ago, 15 players said they would not play for him until he created a more professional work environment.\nAfter Rubiales refused to step down last week and accused Hermoso of lying, the entire team of World Cup winners plus dozens more players said they would not play again for Spain until the president was gone.\nSpain's men's team has also been impacted. Coach Luis de la Fuente had to ask for forgiveness for having applauded Rubiales's sexist-tinged speech to the general assembly. His players also condemned Rubiales's behaviour in a statement.\nSo far, there is no indication that the women players are set to return to the team even after the removal of Vilda.\nSpain's left-wing government and its women players hope that the backlash against Rubiales can lead to a reckoning with sexism in soccer.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

I hope athletes are being as vigilant as they possibly can over these next couple of weeks.\"\nAthletes across Canada and around the world are in the position of trying to decide whether to keep competing and training and risk exposing themselves to COVID-19, or protecting themselves by essentially doing nothing in the lead-up to the biggest athletic event of their lives. \nShould an athlete test positive for COVID-19 now, less than then 30 days before the start of competition, they must provide three negative PCR tests and then submit that documentation to the Beijing Olympic committee. The organizing committee then has to clear that athlete to be fit to travel, and the International Olympic Committee has promised case-by-case assessments of athletes who recover after testing positive for COVID-19.\nThere are then two more negative PCR tests required to be able to get on the flight to Beijing, one 96 and one 72 hours from departure. \nCanada's women's hockey team has had to cancel its remaining exhibition games after some positive COVID tests among the team.\n \n(Associated Press)\nChallenge is keeping athletes safe\nLast week in an interview with CBC Sports, David Shoemaker, CEO of the Canadian Olympic Committee expressed concern about keeping athletes safe over the next month leading up to the first charter flight set for Jan. 26.\n\"The real challenge for us over the next 30 days is how do we make sure that Canadian participants can get to Beijing without contracting the virus and therefore become able to test negative to get into that scenario,\" he said. \nThis week, Shoemaker said the COC's medical and support staff learned from Tokyo 2020 and are confident they'll be able to keep athletes safe.\n\"Along with replicating what worked in Tokyo, examples of some of the additional steps we're taking for Beijing 2022 include mandating all Team Canada members be vaccinated, chartering flights with reduced seating to minimize close contacts, supplementing additional testing protocols, and providing a full supply of N95 masks for all Team Canada members,\" Shoemaker said. \n\"While we are monitoring the impact of the Omicron variant closely, we are still confident we can safely attend the 2022 Olympic Winter Games.\"\nTHE BUZZER\nWhat happens to an Olympian who tests positive for COVID-19 before Beijing?\n1 Month Out\nWhat we know and don't know about the Beijing Olympics as COVID-19 surges\nIt's proving to be a challenge, however.\nThe Canadian women's hockey had several players and staff in COVID-19 protocol in December, forcing the team to cancel its remaining exhibitions games ahead of the Olympics. The full team has not reunited since and the 26-person roster must be trimmed to 23 before Jan. 19.\nCanada's bobsled team had 11 athletes and three support staff test positive within the past couple of weeks, forcing many out of competitions in Europe. \nThe mixed doubles Olympic curling trials were cancelled because of a rise in positive COVID-19 tests among athletes who were to compete at the event, and two curlers will now be selected by a group from Curling Canada, the COC and Own the Podiums. \nSome Canadian long track and short track speed skaters have also tested positive over the past couple of months, but Skate Canada, the sport's governing body, wouldn't reveal how many of the athletes have had positive test results. \n\"It is our top priority to ensure the health and safety of our athletes, and their ability to travel to Beijing relies on our continued focus on this goal. With the help of our medical and support staff, we have put in place procedures to ensure our athletes have the safest daily training environment possible in the lead up to Beijing 2022,\" the organization said in a statement to CBC Sports. \nCanada’s Sebastien Toutant celebrates on the podium after winning gold in the men's World Cup slopestyle snowboard event in Calgary on Jan. 1.

While performances at nationals are taken into account, myriad other factors such as results this season and potential to medal in Beijing go into the decisions on who gets to fill Canada's spots.\nFor most of the events, there wasn't much difference. Canadian officials awarded the country's three ice dance berths to Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier, Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Nikolaj Sorensen, and Marjorie Lajoie and Zachary Lagha after they finished in that order in Ottawa. The two men's spots went to winner Keegan Messing and runner-up Roman Sadovsky. Canada's lone women's entry was given to 18-year-old Madeline Schizas after she claimed her first national title. Kirsten Moore-Towers and Michael Marinaro landed one of the two pairs spots after winning that event.\nThe other pairs selection, though, generated controversy. It went to Vanessa James and Eric Radford, despite their withdrawal from the competition after placing fourth in the short program. That didn't sit well with those who felt runners-up Evelyn Walsh and Trennt Michaud earned the spot. But if the goal is winning an Olympic medal, the decision makes sense. James and Radford were the best Canadian pairs duo on the Grand Prix circuit, earning two fourth-place finishes (no Canadians reached the podium in pairs this season). Radford is also a proven Olympic performer, having won bronze in 2018 with former partner Meagan Duhamel before joining up with James prior to this season. Also consider that James and Radford were not at their best in Ottawa, having just returned to the ice after contracting COVID-19 around Christmas.\nIn the end, we might be splitting hairs here. Canada's chances of winning an Olympic pairs medal don't look great, no matter who goes to Beijing. The country's best hope for a figure skating medal is Gilles and Poirier, who took bronze at the world championships last year and were the only Canadians to qualify for this season's (cancelled) Grand Prix Final.

Heading into the weekend's World Cup races in Germany, Christine de Bruin looked like a good bet. She ranked No. 1 in the women's monobob, which is making its Olympic debut in Beijing, and second in the two-woman event with brakewoman Kristen Bujnowski.\nDe Bruin stumbled a bit, though, finishing eighth in the monobob and fifth in the two-woman. That dropped her to third in the two-woman standings and way down to fourth in the monobob. That event is going to be wide-open at the Olympics: a tiny number of points separates the No. 2-ranked pilot from No. 6, which happens to be Canada's Cynthia Appiah (she finished fifth on Saturday). Even the new No. 1, American Elana Meyers Tayor, holds a relatively slim lead after her victory Saturday.\nCanada's only bobsleigh medal of the weekend came from pilot Justin Kripps. The reigning Olympic two-man co-champion \ntook bronze\n in that event on Saturday to remain third in the World Cup standings. He's still second in the four-man after \nplacing fifth\n in that event on Sunday.\nUp: Éliot Grondin\nCanada's best contender for an Olympic snowboard cross medal \ntook bronze\n and placed fifth in the pair of World Cup events held in Russia over the weekend. The 20-year-old, who finished second in the World Cup chase last season and won bronze at the world championships, ranks fourth with one stop left on the schedule before the Olympics.\nDown: Canada's bigger-name snowboarders\nBack-to-back Olympic slopestyle bronze medallist Mark McMorris and 2021 world championships silver medallist Seb Toutant both missed the podium in Saturday's World Cup event at California's Mammoth Mountain. They placed ninth and fifth, respectively. For Toutant, that was still good enough to \nmaintain his lead in the men's standings\n. Darcy Sharpe (fourth) was the top Canadian. 2018 Olympic silver medallists Max Parrot and Laurie Blouin both opted not to compete.\nThere's one more World Cup meet for these athletes before the Olympics — this week in Switzerland.

But the war isn't over.\n An Australian judge today reinstated Djokovic's visa, which was cancelled last week by border officials who said the world's best tennis player didn't qualify for an exemption to the rule requiring all foreign visitors to be fully vaccinated. Djokovic's lawyers had argued that he presented a medical exemption from Tennis Australia and two medical panels, and that he didn't need to be inoculated because he recently recovered from COVID-19. The judge ordered that Djokovic be released from a quarantine hotel, allowing him to return to the practice courts in preparation for the Jan. 17-30 Australian Open. But Djokovic isn't out of the woods yet: a lawyer for the Australian government said the immigration minister \"will consider whether to exercise a personal power of cancellation\" for the visa. If that happens, Djokovic could lose a chance to break a tie with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam men's singles titles of all time. \nRead more about the latest in the Djokovic saga here\n. \nCanada is basking in its surprising ATP Cup victory.\n Singles wins yesterday by Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov over their Spanish opponents gave Canada its first-ever title in the annual men's team tennis event. The Canadian squad got swept by the United States in its opening matchup but roared back to beat Germany and Great Britain to win the group before upsetting defending-champion Russia in the semis and then beating Spain in the final. Auger-Aliassime and Shapovalov teamed up to win the deciding doubles match vs. Russia, which featured world No. 2 Daniil Medvedev. In the final, the 14th-ranked Shapovalov defeated No. 21 Pablo Carreno Busta before ninth-ranked Auger-Aliassime beat No. 17 Roberto Bautista Agut to clinch the victory without needing the doubles match. \nRead more about Canada's historic win here\n.\nAnd finally...\nThe NFL season went out with a bang. \nAt a time when other pro sports leagues are struggling to stage watchable games (or even games at all), this one just keeps churning out top-notch entertainment and drama. The final day of the regular season saw would-be Super Bowl contender Indianapolis knocked out of the playoffs with an incomprehensible loss to Jacksonville, the worst team in the league. Minutes later, Pittsburgh rose up from the dead and into the playoff picture with an overtime win over Baltimore. That set up an incredible scenario for the Sunday night season finale between the L.A. Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. The winner would make the playoffs and the loser would be eliminated — unless they tied, in which case they'd both get in and Pittsburgh would be bounced. Chaos aficionados on the internet wanted the Chargers and Raiders to kneel out the clock for 60 minutes. But, whether due to a sense of honour or maybe the pressures of the Prisoner's Dilemma, they played it out. And thank goodness, because it turned out to be one of the most exciting games in memory. After the Chargers rallied to force OT (and stay alive in the extra frame) with several do-or-die fourth-down conversions by magical quarterback Justin Herbert, the Raiders eschewed the tie as time expired and buried L.A. with a last-second field goal.

More than a handful of big roadway projects are on the go and they include paving on Notre Dame, the Kingsway and Barrydowne Roads, some of the busiest parts of the city.", "content": "If you've been driving within the Sudbury city limits this summer, you likely ran into construction in every corner of the city. \nBut according to David Shelsted, director of engineering services with the City of Greater Sudbury, although it's been busy, it has not been any different from past summers.\n\"We typically spend about $80 million and it's spread across a larger area,\" said Shelsted. \n\"A lot of it is on our busier corridors, but it is a busy year.\"\nOne major high-traffic area is the Barry Downe and Kingsway intersection. \nAccording to Shelsted, it is considered to be one of the busiest sections within the city and he said the work underway there is going well.\n\"The project was actually proposed to extend over a couple of construction seasons. But, the vast majority of the construction will be completed this year.\"\nHe said the surface asphalt is complete from west of Barry Downe to Silver Hill. \nThe only thing left to complete in that area is line painting. \nHe added the work happening within the Barry Downe and Kingsway intersection is almost complete, with most of the underground construction work happening at night. \nMore time needed for storm sewer work\nShelsted said the construction team is working to improve storm sewers. For that to happen, he said, crews must run a storm sewer through the intersection that is two to three metres in depth.\nDavid Shelsted is director of engineering services for the City of Greater Sudbury.\n \n(Olivia Stefanovich/CBC)\nHe said crews have encountered rock, but are unable to blast during the night. Chipping the rock out is what is adding to the time needed to do the work.\n\"The work is expected to be done within the next week or two,\" said Shelsted. \n\"The pipe will come across and then driving will see granular material in the intersection. The area will be paved after all the underground infrastructure is complete.\"\nConstruction crews will be moving soon down the Kingsway to the intersection between Falconbridge and Barry Downe. \nAt the moment, Shelsted said, those driving to that intersection will find a median island. Soon, the island will be fleshed out, and cycle tracks and a sidewalk will be added on both sides of the Kingsway.\n\"Some of that work may occur in 2024,\" said Shelsted. \"The paving will get done this year and then the restoration of that area like the sidewalks and the asphalt may be done in 2024 depending how quickly winter sets upon us.\"\nShelsted said the asphalt recycling project at the intersection of Second Avenue and the bypass has been put on hold. \nThe City of Sudbury has requested that a third-party consultant undertake tests from a certified lab. Shelsted said they expect to receive the report back within the next few weeks. \nCycling path work set to be done by October\nThe construction taking place from Wilma to Kathleen will be ongoing as they are working to put in a cycling path in the area. \nThe project is set to be completed by the end of October. \nAnother ongoing project is the construction taking place on Paris Street at the Bridge of Nations. \nShelsted said two of the four lanes in that area are closed. He said a lot of work is being done not only above, but also underneath the bridge. He hopes both will be completed by the end of 2023, with work beginning on the other side of Paris in the new year.\n\"We have run into some delays,\" said Shelsted. \"We are going to see what work can be completed before winter and some of that work may continue into 2024.\" \nConstruction work happening near the valley is Phase 1 of an active transportation project. \n\"The ultimate project is to put a three meter multi-use asphalt path from MR-15 to Yorkshire,\" said Shelsted. \"The current contract that is going to get started is from the Val Caron Mall to Main street which is set to be complete before the winter.\" \nThe Frood roundabout on Lasalle has closed Frood Road but Shelsted said it will open up at the beginning of September. He said the roundabout will not be fully functional right away. Drivers will see some temporary traffic signals as the crew continues to work on that location. He said the plan is to have it become a functional roundabout before winter arrives. \nGreater Sudbury starts 2023 road construction season\nDispute between city and contractor pauses roadwork in Sudbury, Ont.\n\"There will be some rehabilitation work that will need to occur next year to finish off the project,\" said Shelsted. \nHe said crews are on budget this year with a few of the projects actually ahead of schedule. \nShelsted shared different projects come up at different times throughout the year. A good example is the construction taking place on Larch street — it only began after the Place des Arts building was completed. \n\"We co-ordinated with the downtown when the construction would begin on Larch,\" said Shelsted.\n\"What is interesting is that we are introducing a few pilot projects like above grade flower planters. We are looking to do some tree planting at Brady and we have also gone to mountable curbs which will allow barrier free access going to and from their vehicles. It will also help facilitate the patio programs that are downtown.\"\nShelsted said he is grateful to commuters during this time and notes the benefits that will come from the current construction will be there for the next 20 plus years to come as traffic flow improves.", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-08-30T05:00:00.500000", "date_modified": "2023-08-30T14:57:54.854000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

Of 39 people recommended for charges by the special grand jury, Trump and 18 others were indicted.\nThe special grand jury recommended charging longtime U.S. Sen.

As well, a county prosecutor indicting a sitting U.S. senator for federal election offences would have likely led to legal challenges over jurisdiction.\nWATCH l Explaining Georgia's racketeering case strategy: \nTrump's indictments explained: Why Georgia is charging him like a 'Mob boss' | About That\n24 days ago\nDuration \n15:05\nFormer U.S. president Donald Trump is facing criminal charges for the fourth time, after a Georgia grand jury issued a sweeping indictment accusing him of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden and of running a ‘criminal enterprise.’ Andrew Chang explains all of the charges, and why the latest are so significant.\nNotably, many of the tallies to indict Trump on various charges featured one 'no' vote. It's not clear if it was one person consistently voting no, or if the no votes were spread out among jurors depending on the count.\nWhile the special grand jury consisted of over 20 members — more than would hear the case in a criminal trial — it illustrates that a conviction against Trump is not a guarantee.\nAnalysis\nWhy a law used against the Mob is behind Georgia's prosecution of Donald Trump\nAnalysis\nWhy Georgia's prosecution of Trump is different from his other indictments\nThe sprawling indictment detailed dozens of alleged acts by Trump or 18 others to undo his defeat against U.S. President Joe Biden, including beseeching Georgia's Republican secretary of state to find enough votes for him to win the battleground state; harassing an election worker who faced false claims of fraud; and attempting to persuade Georgia lawmakers to ignore the will of voters and appoint a new slate of electoral college electors favourable to Trump.\nThe case, filed under Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, sees Trump face 13 counts including soliciting a public officer to violate their oath, conspiring to impersonate a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery in the first degree and conspiring to file false documents.\nTrump, again vying for the Republican presidential nomination, has pleaded not guilty. When surrendering to the charges last month, he was subjected to a historic first-ever mug shot of a former U.S. president.\nLegal manoeuvring in effect\nLawyers Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell, among the 18 other defendants, have exercised their right to demand a speedy trial in the case. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee this week set an Oct. 23 trial date for the pair, but seemed skeptical of prosecutors' arguments that all 19 defendants could be tried together that soon.\nFormer White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, a meanwhile, is trying to get the case moved to federal court, arguing that he was acting as a federal officer at the time. A decision on that matter is imminent.\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee presides over a hearing regarding media access in the case against former president Donald Trump and 18 others on Aug. 31. McAfee has already set a trial date for at least two of the defendants.\n \n(Arvin Temkar/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/The Associated Press)\nThere is some overlap in the allegations in the Georgia case with charges Trump faces in a federal indictment filed by the office of special counsel Jack Smith, under the aegis of the Justice Department. That indictment charges Trump with four felony counts related to his efforts to undo his 2020 election loss, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding.\nIn either case, conviction could lead to a years-long prison sentence though appeals, perhaps all the way up to the Supreme Court, would reasonably be expected.\nA trial date for that federal case has been set for March 4, 2024.\nThe Georgia case differs in that neither Trump, nor any Republican who were to become president, would be able to issue a pardon in the event of a conviction given it is a state case.\nTrump faces two other criminal indictments handed down since March. As with the election interference matters, they stem from investigations that began long before he announced last November his plans to run for president in 2024.\nTrump has slammed each of the prosecutions, declaring his innocence in each instance. He faces a New York state trial beginning on March 25, 2024, involving allegations of the falsification of business records in connection with hush money payments to three individuals, including two women who said they had extramarital affairs with Trump.\nHe also faces a federal trial slated to begin in May 2024 where he faces Espionage Act charges, as well as an obstruction of justice charge, related to the accusation that he unlawfully retained government documents. Most of the documents were classified and some designated as top secret. ", "author": [], "video_url": [], "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},

It concerns remarks that Trump made in 2019, after Carroll first publicly claimed that he sexually attacked her in a dressing room after a chance meeting at a luxury department store in 1996. He denies that anything happened between them.\nThe first trial, this spring, concerned the sexual assault allegation and whether some 2022 Trump comments were defamatory. Jurors awarded Carroll $5 million, finding that she was sexually abused but rejecting her allegation that she was raped.\n\"The jury considered and decided issues that are common to both cases — including whether Mr. Trump falsely accused Ms. Carroll of fabricating her sexual assault charge and, if that were so, that he did it with knowledge that this accusation was false'' or acted with reckless disregard for the truth, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in Wednesday's decision.\nE. Jean Carroll leaves the Manhattan Federal Court following the verdict in the civil rape accusation case against former U.S. President Donald Trump in New York City on May 9.\n \n(Brendan McDermid/REUTERS)\nThe judge wrote that the \"substantive content'' of the 2019 and 2022 statements was the same. And when the jury found that Trump, 77, indeed sexually abused Carroll, it effectively established that his 2019 statements also were false and defamatory, the judge said.\nCarroll, now 79, and her attorneys \"look forward to trial limited to damages for the original defamatory statements Donald Trump made,'' said her lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who's not related to the judge.\nTrump lawyer Alina Habba said Wednesday that his legal team is confident that the jury verdict will be overturned, mooting the judge's new decision. Trump, the early front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, also is seeking to put the second trial on hold while waiting for an appeals court to rule on whether he's legally shielded from the yet-to-be-tried case.\nJury finds Donald Trump sexually abused and defamed columnist E. Jean Carroll\nHe claims immunity because he was president when he made the 2019 comments.\nAt least for now, the trial is set to start Jan. 15, the day of the Iowa Republican caucuses.\nTrump facing mounting legal battles\nThe Carroll case is part of a lineup of legal woes that Trump is facing as he campaigns to return to the White House.\nFour criminal indictments accuse Trump, variously, of trying to subvert the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden; mishandling top secret documents and trying to conceal what he'd done; and falsifying records in his business to cover up a hush money payment made during his 2016 campaign to porn actor Stormy Daniels. She asserts that they had a sexual encounter, which he denies.\nSome of Trump's criminal trials are scheduled to overlap with the presidential primary season. So is a civil trial in New York Attorney General Letitia James' lawsuit accusing Trump and his company of defrauding banks, insurers and others by inflating asset values and his net worth. Trump has denied the allegations, boasted that he has \"the hottest brand in the world,'' and accused the Democratic attorney general of conducting a political vendetta.\nA judge on Wednesday refused to delay that trial, set for October.\nWATCH | Trump brushes off sex abuse verdict in May:\n \nTrump brushes off sex abuse verdict in CNN town hall\n4 months ago\nDuration \n2:58\nAfter years of calling CNN 'fake news,’ Donald Trump held a campaign town hall on the network. It came just days after a jury found that Trump, the current frontrunner in the Republican primary race, sexually abused and defamed columnist E. Jean Carroll.\nTrump denied ever meeting Carroll\nCarroll initially sued Trump in 2019, saying he smeared her by saying she'd made a false allegation while \"trying to sell a new book'' and suggesting she might be a Democratic operative.\n\"The world should know what's really going on. It is a disgrace, and people should pay dearly for such false accusations,'' Trump said. He maintained that he'd never met Carroll, brushing off a 1987 photo of the two and their then-spouses at a social event.\nWhere Donald Trump's criminal and civil cases stand\nWhile that case was playing out, Carroll sued again last year under a New York state law that waived a legal time limit for filing sexual assault allegations. That lawsuit — the one that went to trial last year — came to include claims that Trump defamed Carroll in 2022 by calling the case \"a complete con job'' and a \"scam.'' The suit over the 2019 statements remained separate.\nTrump, meanwhile, countered with a defamation suit against Carroll for saying, after the verdict, that she was not only sexually abused but raped.

Through pre-booked appointments, the clinic provides general wellness examinations and vaccinations for cats and dogs and, when necessary and requested by a family, end-of-life care.\nThe appointments are reserved for those who receive government subsidies or have an Indigenous status card, and do not have a relationship with a local veterinarian.\n\"We're trying to move [the unit] around the city and cover all our geographical locations where our services might be needed — so, the Flour Mill, New Sudbury, and we're working on a south end location to try and make it accessible to anybody,\" said Hope Lumbis, manager of the SPCA's Mobile Animal Wellness Services.\nHope Lumbis is manager of the SPCA's Mobile Animal Wellness Services.\n \n(Erika Chorostil/CBC News)\nLumbis said the wellness days take place over two to three days, and at a recent event in August, they were able to help 25 to 30 pets a day between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.\nShe added the number of pets has increased since the pandemic, but veterinarian numbers haven't changed or diminished in some areas, meaning some families haven't been able to access veterinary care.\n\"It definitely is a big problem not only here, but around the country, to be able to access vets in a timely manner to make sure [pets] have those boosters in a designated amount of time to be able to be protected against the diseases around town,\" explained Lumbis.\nSome families can't access veterinary care due to high demand or the inability to travel; others can't afford the service due to various circumstances.\nLumbis said the mobile wellness clinic gives qualifying families a chance to give their pets the care they need in a more accessible manner.\n\"We had quite a few at our last event, people that I don't think would have been able to provide veterinary care for their pets without having the unit there, whether it was people coming with their cats in a carrier in shopping carts or on scooters that didn't have the means to be able to go to a local veterinarian, and had to make the choice between feeding themselves or their pets.\"\nSudbury firefighters step in to help with crowding crisis at pet shelter\nCanada's veterinarians are not OK — overwork, pet owners, debt load leading to burnout\nShe said the wellness days have made a difference in the community and they hope they can keep holding the events over the next few months.\n\"We kind of knew that this was needed around the city but you never know how it's going to be received or how it's going to go, and I think people have taken it really positively, and I think it's helped a lot of us kind of change our perspective on things too, especially the last event, as far as how we work with people in the city and what we can bring to them,\" Lumbis explained.\n\"So it's just been a really positive experience and it makes you kind of feel good at the end of the day to be able to help out.\"\nThe next Mobile Wellness Days event is set for Sept. 14 to 16 at Morel Park in Sudbury.\nLumbis said they're planning October dates to be at a location in the city's south end and more dates may be scheduled for November, depending on the weather.

Lumbis said the unit was previously in eastern Ontario before making its way to Sudbury at the start of summer.\nLumbis said the City of Greater Sudbury has been supportive of the SPCA, giving them access to the Capreol fire station to park the mobile unit and working with the organization to find locations for them to hold the wellness days.\n\"During surgery days, we have a city shelter worker that comes and helps us. They've offered a bunch of employees as well for the event days to help with something as simple as carrying around carriers or helping the public out, so they've been a great support to us to offer whatever resources we need.\"\nLumbis added they currently rely on the work of one to two veterinarians for the surgery and wellness days, either locally or from southern Ontario, who travel to work. She said they hope to expand their service days to help more people and pets, but would need more veterinarians to help them with the clinic.\n \"Our goal would be to be able to support, as best as we can, shelters, rescues and people who just don't have the means to be able to bring their pets in.\"", "author": [{"name": "Erika Chorostil", "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/author/erika-chorostil-1.6838463", "email": "erika.chorostil@cbc.ca", "about": "Erika Chorostil is a reporter/editor with CBC News in Sudbury.

This is to ensure costs of the improvements needed and the purchase price equals to an amount that someone paying market rent in community housing could afford. \n\"There's a lot of houses that don't make the cut as we do our pre-inspection, but the ones that do, that's really where the magic of this unique program works.\"\nBefore handing over the home to their new owners, DSSMSSAB receives a conventional mortgage through their partnership with the Community First Credit Union.\nThey then act as the cosigner for that mortgage, so that if the new owner misses a mortgage payment, DSSMSSAB is in a position to repossess the house. \n\"So it's a much stricter program than would be at typical banks and that helps to lower the interest rate that the folks are getting. So this gets them the lowest market interest rate.\"\nDufour added, if necessary DSSMSSAB will also put forward the down payment as the cosigner for the mortgage and then forgive 10 to 20% in the subsequent years. . \n\"The idea being that after the five year term of the mortgage has expired, hopefully the folks who are new homeowners will be in a position to take on the mortgage themselves and just have their own typical relationship with the credit union.\"\nThe new home on London Street is right across from the first home that was renovated and handed over.  \n\"We're trying to really use this as kind of an urban redevelopment tool.\" \nDufour says often the term 'gentrification' holds dividing opinions.\n\"It tends to price out the people who are in the neighborhood already. They don't get to experience the benefits of the rising equity.\"\nBut, he says the Affordable Home Ownership program is a way to give people who are already living in that neighborhood an opportunity to own property and then to start using it as a tool to improve neighbourhoods.  \n\"Homeowners having their pride of ownership for their own space has been really huge,\" Dufour said.\n\"Everyone who's been a receipt of one of these homes has really gone above and beyond in the months in, just adding and really taking such good care of the house.\"", "author": [], "video_url": [], "date_published": "2023-09-02T07:00:00.108000", "date_modified": "2023-09-02T13:06:11.837000", "number_of_likes": 0, "number_of_shares": 0, "comments": [], "language": "", "geographic_location": "", "location_name": "", "metadata": {"_author": null}},
